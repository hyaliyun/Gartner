The England World Cup squad were sent off with a smile on their faces today after a comedian tried to board their plane masquerading as a member of the team. Dressed in a shiny, grey suit and with gelled hair, Simon Brodkin - best known for his comic creation Lee Nelson - pushed past the security guards and attempted to join the squad today as they flew from Luton Airport to Miami for the start of their World Cup training.

The comic was then seen berating","output":"the security guards for questioning his presence, insisting that he was a vital part of the team and demanding to be allowed to continue on the journey. The players and coaching staff couldn't help but chuckle at the unexpected incident, as Brodkin continued to try and blend in with the team.

Ensuring that each section of hair is neatly separated and free from tangles, the stylist works diligently to create a harmonious blend of waves, curls, or added volume, depending on the client's preferences and hair type. To maintain the highest level of precision, the stylist may use various tools, such as a fine-toothed comb to smooth out the hair strands and ensure even distribution. They might also use hair clips to keep unrolled sections organized and out of the way, preventing any unintentional interference with the ongoing roller placements. Throughout the process, they constantly assess the hair's texture, elasticity, and thickness, adjusting their technique accordingly. Once all of the rollers have been installed, the stylist moves on to the next step in the styling process, which often involves setting the hair. This can be done in a few different ways, such as applying a setting lotion, mousse, or gel to the hair before blow-drying it on a low heat setting or placing the client under a hair dryer. The use of heat is essential in activating and locking in the curl pattern, ensuring lasting results. As the client waits for their hair to set, the stylist may check in periodically, using a gentle touch to assess whether the curls are forming as desired. If necessary, they may adjust the temperature or duration of the drying process, or even tweak the placement of rollers, to enhance the final outcome. The stylist also uses this time to clean and organize their workstation, ensuring that all tools and supplies are neatly arranged and ready for the next phase. Once the appropriate amount of time has passed, and the stylist is confident that the client's hair is fully set, they carefully begin the process of unraveling the rollers. Emphasizing a delicate touch to avoid disrupting or damaging the newly-formed curls and waves, they slowly remove each roller, one by one. As each section of hair is released, the stylist may use their fingers or a wide-toothed comb to gently separate and shape the curls, creating the desired level of volume and bounce. Finally, the stylist applies a lightweight finishing product, such as a serum, hairspray, or pomade, to seal in the style and provide added definition, flexibility, and shine. They also provide the client with professional advice on how to maintain and refresh their new hairstyle at home, along with personalized product recommendations tailored to their specific needs. With a final evaluation and any necessary touch-ups, the stylist presents their completed work to the client, eagerly awaiting their reaction and feedback. Through their careful attention to detail, vast knowledge of hair textures and styling techniques, and clear communication with the client, the stylist has successfully transformed their client's hair into the desired look, leaving them feeling both confident and beautiful."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.  Question: \\"What is the biggest obstacle for neighborhood legal services and why?\\" Answer: \\"Lack of interest\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"No, sweetie, that's not correct. In this story, the biggest problem Neighborhood Legal Services is facing is the language barrier. A lot of the people they are trying to help speak different languages, especially Asian languages.

Some historians argue that Napoleon III also sought war, particularly for the diplomatic defeat in 1866 in leveraging any benefits from the Austro-Prussian War, and he believed he would win a conflict with Prussia. They also argue that he wanted a war to resolve growing domestic political problems. Other historians, notably French historian Pierre Milza, dispute this. On 8 May 1870, shortly before the war, French voters had overwhelmingly supported Napoleon III's program in a national plebiscite, with 7,358,000 votes yes against 1,582,000 votes no, an increase of support of two million votes since the legislative elections in 1869.

Mary could afford a nice meal. Mary had been planning the perfect night out to impress Rachel for quite some time. Ever since her promotion at work, she finally felt comfortable splurging on a special evening together. She wanted to treat Rachel to the finer things, and after extensive research and recommendations from her well-to-do colleagues, she decided on the upscale restaurant, \\"La Fleur Eternelle.\\" Upon arrival, Mary swooped open the car door for Rachel, and the two strolled toward the luxurious entrance of La Fleur Eternelle, tucked amid manicured gardens. The warm glow from the chandeliers inside spilled onto the lush red carpet as they entered, hand in hand. As soon as they were seated at their candlelit table, Mary ordered two glasses of the finest champagne to start. Each sip was a pleasant and delicate surprise for Rachel, who had hardly any experience with such indulgence. The excitement in her eyes was evident, making Mary's choice even more rewarding. She took pride in providing this experience for her dear friend. For the first course, they decided to share the exquisite truffle foie gras terrine, accompanied by tender, crunchy slices of toasted brioche. Each bite was a symphony of flavors, further enhancing the already divine evening. Rachel could hardly contain her delight and slyly whispered to Mary, \\"I could get used to this!\\" As they reveled in the atmosphere and their time together, they continued onto the main course. Mary, knowing her friend's love for seafood, suggested the pan-seared sea scallops with a lemon beurre blanc and a side of saffron risotto. They were cooked to perfection, filling their mouths with a sumptuous burst of flavors. Finally, for dessert, Mary took Rachel's hand and guided her eyes to the most decadent selection on the menu - the chocolate fondant with raspberry coulis and a scoop of Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream. As the melting chocolate and rich red raspberry sauce danced around their palates, they exchanged sweet smiles over the indulgence. In the end, Mary was undeniably victorious in her effort to make the evening memorable. The delight on Rachel's face was a testament to her success. And as the night continued, they found themselves lost in conversation, reminiscing about old memories and creating new ones. For in that moment, Mary knew she had given Rachel more than just a remarkable meal. Their friendship had blossomed, and what once was a warm connection now bloomed with an affection that neither one could dare to forget.

Phone Soap: Charge and Clean Your Phone  You may charge your phone every day, but do you clean your phone as much? Whatever your hands touch, your phones touch. It has been discovered that some phones have 18 times more bacteria and viruses than any surface in a public restroom. So it probably won't surprise you that a 2011 University of London study found that one in six of our phones have bacteria and viruses on them--specifically, the bacteria called E. coli.  The research on bacteria and viruses led to the invention of Phone Soap. It is not actually liquid like dishwasher soap. It is a phone charger that uses the electromagnetic radiation used in hospitals to kill 99.9 percent of bacteria and viruses, cleaning your phone while it charges.  \\"There are really certain types of bacteria and viruses that we should not be in touch with, and they are really on our phones,\\" says Wes Barnes, the Phone Soap co-founder. It all started while his cousin and co-founder, Dan LaPorte, was in his cancer research lab at college. \\"He realized he got the idea of getting rid of bacteria and viruses on the phones,\\" said Barnes. \\"In the lab they used UV-C light for destroying them. He realized this would be the fastest, most powerful way to kill any bacteria and viruses living on electronic machines.\\"  Phone Soap looks like a little metal suitcase. Your phone rests in to charge and get cleaned at the same time. Instead of plugging your phone into the wall, you'd plug it into the Phone Soap charger box. The process only takes a few minutes but, Barnes says, \\"The idea is that you can leave it in there overnight if you want to keep charging. Reflective paint keeps the light completely around the phone so it cleans the phone fully.\\"  The co-founders spent 2013 finding the right companies and they started shipping the product in late November. By last week's International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Phone Soap was all grown-up. Both co-founders have left their previous jobs and are selling Phone Soap nonstop. \\"We're shipping almost more than we can handle each day,\\" Barnes says. \\"It's been a great adventure.\\" Answer this series of questions: 1. How much bacteria can be on your phone?","output":"Your phone can have a lot of bacteria, even 18 times more than some surfaces in a public restroom. In fact, one in six phones may have a specific type of bacteria called E. coli on them.

Please answer the following question: The popularity of lip pencils and crayons is soaring, I suspect it’s because they’re just so easy to use. I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply. Question: What does the narrator most likely think that MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil should do with the plum color she bought? Options: - Make it more pigmented and less shiny   - Reformulate it to have more pearl in the color like it's advertised to have   - Create a strictly plum color and a strictly pearl color   - not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"Reformulate it to have more pearl in the color like it's advertised to have"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lukather recruited keyboardist Jeff Babko and guitarist Larry Carlton, who Lukather had worked with previously, to help arrange the songs.

Please answer the following question: The increase in electrons across the periodic table explains why elements go from metals to metalloids and then to nonmetals from left to right across the table. Look at period 2 in Figure below as an example. Lithium (Li) is a metal, boron (B) a metalloid, and fluorine (F) and neon (Ne) are nonmetals. The inner energy level is full for all four elements. This level has just one orbital and can hold a maximum of two electrons. The outer energy level is a different story. This level has four orbitals and can hold a maximum of eight electrons. Lithium has just one electron in this level, boron has three, fluorine has seven, and neon has eight.  James is memorizing the periodic table and some of the features of the elements on it. He is currently working on the fourth row which starts with Potassium (K) on the far left and ends with Krypton (Kr) to the far right.  Given two elements are in the same row of the periodic table, which element will have a higher number of elections, a metal or a nonmetal? Answer:","output":"A nonmetal will have a higher number of electrons compared to a metal when they are in the same row of the periodic table. This is because as you move from left to right across the table, the atomic number (and thus the number of electrons) increases. Metals are generally found on the left side of the periodic table, while nonmetals are on the right side.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the orchestra to whose funds Bould always contributed his share of the recording fees?  In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with Decca Records, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the Communist party; when the cold war began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be \\"seriously jeopardized financially\\" if Russell remained in post.  A later writer, Richard Witts, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of Elizabeth II. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's Processional and Walton's march Orb and Sceptre.  In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: The Times found a Brahms symphony \\"rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring\\", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of The Planets. In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the Royal Albert Hall in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including Paul Kletzki, Jean Martinon,  Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt, Georg Solti, Walter Susskind and Vaughan Williams.In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia.

Apparently, Chris violently disagreed with her and in a fit of anger threw a rock through her car window, shattering it.            The report goes on to say without continued therapy and a strong recovery support network, Probation says his prognosis is \\"very guarded.\\"            And here's an interesting detail from the report: before Chris entered rehab on October 29th, he says he had issues with Attention Deficit Disorder and also underwent a period of depression.            TMZ broke the story ... Chris got booted from the Malibu facility earlier this month following the outburst ... after just two weeks of treatment.            As we reported, the judge has just ordered Brown to 90 days in a facility and also ordered him to submit to drug testing.             ||||| Chris Brown was ordered by a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge on Wednesday to check into a live-in rehab facility for 90 days' worth of anger management, L.A. Now reports.      That order came during a probation hearing that had been on the schedule before the R&B singer was arrested in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 27 and charged with misdemeanor assault.      During the 90-day live-in stint, to be done in Los Angeles County at a facility approved by probation officials, Brown will also have to complete three eight-hour days of community service each week and undergo periodic drug tests. He's still on probation related to his 2009 assault of then-girlfriend Rihanna.      He will be allowed to fly to Washington for legal proceedings related to his assault charge.      Also, it turns out that Brown, who'd gone to rehab of his own accord after the D.C. arrest but walked out about two weeks later, was actually ordered out of that Malibu facility Nov. 10 for violent behavior after he threw a rock and shattered a window on his mother's car, according to a probation report obtained by L.A. Now.      The blow-up was initiated during a family counseling session in which his mom said she wanted him to stay in treatment, the records show. Brown then walked out and tossed the rock. Nobody was hurt.      Brown previously completed an anger-management course as part of his assault sentence, but he appears to need a little bit more work in that area.

Answer the following question: Process:  - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less aluminum consumed in the town happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if less aluminum is consumed in the town, it may lead to a greater amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream.  To determine if this hypothesis has a direct or indirect effect on the described process of respiration and gas exchange in the human body, we must first understand the potential relationship between aluminum consumption and oxygen delivery. Aluminum, as a metal, is not typically ingested or consumed by humans in significant amounts. However, small amounts of aluminum can be found in some foods, drinking water, and even pharmaceuticals or personal care products. There is ongoing research about the potential health effects of aluminum exposure, including potential neurotoxicity and a possible link to Alzheimer's disease. Despite these concerns, there is no current evidence to suggest that aluminum consumption has a direct impact on the process of breathing or oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. Aluminum does not take part in the gas exchange process in the lungs or play a role in transporting oxygen or carbon dioxide in the respiratory system. Therefore, the perturbation hypothesis does not have a direct effect on the process described. Additionally, since the connection between aluminum consumption and oxygen delivery is not well-established, it is also unlikely that there is an indirect effect on the process. However, further research may be needed to definitively rule out any potential indirect effects on oxygen delivery or systemic health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Activate the amp like you normally would and note what happens. No matter what type of amp you have, something is supposed to change when you hit the on switch and turn up the volume. A lot of amps have power lights that activate when the amp is live. Also, listen for any noises the amp makes, since that could also help you determine the source of the problem. Car amps, for example, often have a green power LED light and a red “protect” light. The protect light often means a blown fuse, so you know to check the wiring when you see it. Go over all the wires, double-checking that they are plugged in correctly. If the amp doesn’t activate at all when you turn it on, the problem could have to do with the power supply. Sometimes you have to contend with a loose cord, which is a very easy fix to make. Wiggle the wires, testing them to see if they are in place and cause the amp to activate at all.  Car amps, for instance, often have a red power wire and a black ground wire. It also has a blue remote turn-on wire that powers the amp when you turn on your vehicle. If your amp plugs into the wall, test the power cord. Also, make sure your guitar, speakers, subwoofers, and other devices are connected to the amp if you’re using them. So your amp turns on, which is a plus, but it doesn’t sound right. Sound distortion can be caused by a few different issues depending on what kind of amp you have. It is often from loose wires, but it could also be your overall setup. Sometimes replacing the wires, fixing the amp’s components, or changing your setup suddenly makes everything better. If you don’t hear any sound but know your amp is on, the wiring is likely the culprit. Moving the wires may give you a burst of sound. You may also need to detach speakers or other devices overpowering the amp. Summary:","output":"To fix an amp, first check if it turns on and look for any lights or noises. If it doesn't turn on, check the wires to make sure they are connected properly. For car amps, look for red, black, and blue wires.

Q:Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Christian Soucy is a former professional ice hockey goaltender who is considered the NHL's version of what major league baseball player who appeared in one game for the Giants on June 29, 1905? A:","output":"After conducting thorough research, the Major League Baseball (MLB) player that Christian Soucy is considered the NHL's version of is Archibald \\"Moonlight\\" Graham. Here is a detailed analysis of both players and the reasons behind this comparison. Christian Soucy is a former professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft. Soucy had a brief professional career with stints in the AHL and ECHL before retiring in the mid-90s. However, he never made it to the ice for a regular-season NHL game, making him somewhat of a \\"phantom\\" player in NHL history. Similarly, Archibald \\"Moonlight\\" Graham was a Major League Baseball player who appeared in only one game for the New York Giants on June 29, 1905. Graham was an outfielder, and in the only game, he played in the majors, he didn't get an opportunity to bat. He was a defensive substitution in the top of the ninth inning and did not get an at-bat before the game ended. Like Soucy, Graham's career in the MLB was brief and limited to just one appearance. The comparison between Christian Soucy and Moonlight Graham highlights their shared experience of having a negligible impact while playing at the top level of their respective sports. Both athletes had long journeys in trying to establish themselves as professional athletes, but their careers ultimately peaked with a sole appearance in the respective high-caliber leagues – for Soucy, the NHL, and Graham, the MLB. Additionally, neither player managed to achieve a statistic in their respective leagues. Soucy didn't play in any NHL games, while Graham didn't have an at-bat in his only MLB appearance. These two players serve as symbolic reminders of the challenges that many professional athletes face while pursuing their career goals. In a world where success and longevity are often attributed to the upper echelon of professional sports, Soucy and Graham remind us of the numerous athletes who experience only fleeting moments in the top leagues. With their unique stories unfolding in different eras and different sports, Christian Soucy and Archibald \\"Moonlight\\" Graham are analogous reflections of the aspirations, obstacles, and ultimately, the brevity that thousands of professional sportsmen and women face."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I am a Christian... and I feel this movie is awful. Nobody but hard-core, Bible-belt Christians are going to like this movie. The message is just too in your face. If you want to touch a wider audience, you have to be way more subtle. You can't have the dad waving the bible around and carrying it with him in EVERY scene. RIDICULOUS!  Poor direction. The reveal of people missing should have been terrifying, but it was laughable. They leave their clothes on the ground? It reminded me of old Ed Wood movies: \\"Oh my God! People are missing!\\" That scene in the plane is just stupid. Think about it: if you found your relative's clothes next to you, you wouldn't just scream \\"oh my god. they disappeared! they're missing!\\" and start crying and yelling. You would first be in denial... you just wouldn't jump to that conclusion. Watch Jodie Foster in FLIGHTPLAN. My favorite shot is the dog sitting out on the lawn with a pile of clothes and boots sitting next to him. I about fell off the couch I was laughing so hard. The music was so bad and so distracting. It was as if the composer was in his own world scoring his own movies. \\"here's my chance to do a thriller\\", \\"here's my chance to do action!\\" STOP TELLING ME HOW TO FEEL JAMES COVELL! A good score supports what's happening on the screen... this movie needed more of an UNDER score, but instead it was as much in your face as the message was. The writing was bland. So was Captain Christian Kirk Cameron. Chelsea was the worse: \\"you don't understand! People are missing!\\". Brad Johnson was laughable. The two stand out performances came from the Anti-Christ and the older guy (sorry, can't remember their names) In watching the \\"making of\\" (to answer my question of \\"what were they thinking???\\"), the producers and filmmakers and actors are just deluding themselves... saying \\"we're gonna reach wide audiences\\" and \\"brad Johnson is amazing\\" and \\"this is just like a Hollywood movie\\". I came to the conclusion that they just don't know what the \\"heck\\" they are doing. I commend the effort. Getting the message to a wide audience is a fantastic idea. Film is the best medium possible to do that. Look at movies like WIDE AWAKE, SIGNS, CONTACT, PASSION OF Christ, even O'BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?

World opinion begins to turn against robotics, leading to the U.N. declaring a unilateral ban on further research and development in 2067. Japan, being home to robotics pioneer Daiwa Heavy Industries, the governing body, strongly protests this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage.In protest, Japan withdraws from international politics. All foreigners are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructed a series of 270 off-shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field that distorts the entire electromagnetic spectrum, nullifying all communication between Japan and the outside world and making even satellite surveillance impossible. Trade and diplomacy continues, but for all intents and purposes, Japan vanishes from the world scene.Ten years later, the American Navy technology Special Forces unit \\"SWORD\\" is lead on the intel of a Japanese informant of a trap set by Daiwa in Colorado. The instigator, Saito, escapes, cut off his own leg to get rid of Vexille Serra, a soldier of SWORD. Analysis of the leg show that it is made of bio-metal. SWORD then begin to suspect that Japan has used the R.A.C.E network to conceal extensive development of banned technologies. They thus embark on an unapproved scheme to infiltrate Japan and determine the distortion frequency of the R.A.C.E. network, enabling SWORD to gather intelligence on the country.Although the agents successfully enter Japan, they are detected by security forces before they can transmit the distortion frequency. Vexille is the sole SWORD agent to evade capture or death, and only her lover Leon survives to be taken to Daiwa's headquarters.Vexille awakens without her powered armor suit to find that Tokyo is now a shanty town ruled by Daiwa.

My mom ushered all of us inside the house, where she looked like she was about to explode. I could feel the tension building up like a ticking time bomb, and I knew that there was no escape now. My freedom had slipped through my fingers like sand, and all I could do was brace myself for the consequences. As we entered the living room, my mom motioned for us to sit down, her eyes never leaving mine. The sternness in her gaze was like daggers piercing through my skin. I gulped, sensing the impending doom and humiliation that was about to follow. \\"So,\\" my mom began, her voice tense and sharp, \\"I think it's about time we discussed what exactly happened today and why I had to search for you across town.\\" I glanced down at my feet, unable to meet my mom's gaze as I mumbled my apologies. To my astonishment, Jack spoke up first, attempting to take some of the blame for the situation. \\"Mrs. Thompson, I just wanted to say that it wasn't all your daughter's fault. We ran into some unexpected traffic, and everything sort of spiraled out of control from there.\\" Isaac nodded in agreement, chiming in with his own excuses. \\"Yeah, we didn't really anticipate how long the lines at the amusement park would be, and time just got away from us.\\" I was incredibly grateful for their efforts to try and diffuse the tension and share the responsibility, but I knew deep down that my actions brought us to this unpleasant situation. As grateful as I was that they didn't abandon me, I couldn't help but wonder if this was the end of my friendship with Jack and my newfound connection with Isaac. My mom listened intently, her expression softening slightly but still maintaining that stern demeanor. \\"While I appreciate your honesty, boys, it doesn't excuse the fact that my daughter disobeyed my instructions and didn't even bother to contact me to let me know what was happening. This caused unnecessary worry and frustration.\\" Turning her gaze towards me, she continued, \\"You, young lady, are grounded for two weeks. No outings, no hanging out with Jack or Isaac, and no access to your phone. You can use the landline if you need to call someone. I also expect you to make a sincere apology to your friends here, as they're now implicated in this mess as well.\\" Hanging my head in shame, I muttered my apologies to Jack and Isaac, promising to make it up to them as soon as my grounding was over. Surprisingly, they both seemed to understand the severity of the situation and simply assured me that things would eventually blow over and that our friendships would remain intact. As they left my house, I couldn't help but feel waves of both guilt and relief crashing over me. While I knew my punishment was just and deserved, it was also reassuring to see that my friends were willing to stand by my side even during the darkest moments. As the door closed behind them, I turned towards my mom, offering a final, heartfelt apology before trudging up the stairs towards my room - my prison for the next two weeks. But as I lay in bed that night, the support and encouragement from my friends fueled my resolve to grow from this experience, to learn from my mistakes, and to keep the bonds of our friendship alive. The following days were filled with a mix of mundane chores and quiet reflection, helping me understand that there was more to life than just chasing temporary freedom.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The introduction is a very important part of an essay—perhaps the most important—because it orients your reader and explains your argument. For the first draft, however, don't agonize over it. You just need to begin writing. The introduction doesn't have to be perfect in the first draft, because you can come back and edit it later. Get something down, and it will help you move confidently forward.  When you are pressed for time, don't worry too much about writing a creative introduction—just try to write one that is clear and focused. If you have time left at the end, you can come back and try to improve it. A simple but effective plan is to make sure that your introduction states your essay's thesis, and gives an overview of what the subsequent paragraphs or sections will discuss. Your outline will help you do this. A simple version of this would look something like \\"In this essay, I will first describe X, before moving on to Y and Z. Then, I will explain the relationship between X,Y, and Z, demonstrating that [insert thesis statement here].\\" Take the writing of the essay bit by bit, following the outline you made. This will keep your writing on track, and keeping your plan in mind will encourage you to keep going. If you're wavering between describing Shakespeare as a \\"great\\" writer, or \\"the greatest,\\" for example, just pick one for now and move on.You'll be able to deal with such things when you do a final read-through of the essay. When time is short, you will write more productively, and keep your morale up, if you keep pushing through with more writing.   Cite any works you use as a reference or for quotations. If you are quoting another work, cite it according to the style (MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.) your instructor wants you to use. Even if you are just paraphrasing a work, you should cite it. If you don't properly cite your sources, you are plagiarizing. As a rule of thumb, if you got an idea or information from a source outside of your own head, you should cite it.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fc/Write-a-Last-Minute-Essay-Step-15-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Write-a-Last-Minute-Essay-Step-15-Version-2.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/f/fc/Write-a-Last-Minute-Essay-Step-15-Version-2.jpg/aid202072-v4-728px-Write-a-Last-Minute-Essay-Step-15-Version-2.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"}  It is far easier to cite while you are writing than to go back and try to add in citations after you have written your paper.  Keep up with them as you go. While you have to work quickly, take a short break from writing now and then, especially if you get stuck—just don't get distracted and take too long.  Some prefer to take scheduled breaks, by setting a timer or watching a clock. Others prefer to take a break after reaching a convenient stopping point, such as the end of a paragraph or page. Whatever method you choose, make a note of where to pick back up when you return to writing. Take a breath, get up, have a drink or snack.

Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are increase or decrease ):   Mona lives in a city that doesn't know much about solar power. As the citizens become less aware of solar and the benefits it offers, the demand for solar power falls. What happens to the cost of the technology as the demand decreases increase or decrease?","output":"As Mona lives in a city where awareness about solar power and its benefits is decreasing, the demand for solar power falls. Based on the passage's statement that as demand increases, technology improves and costs decrease, it can be inferred that as demand decreases, technology improvement slows, and costs may not experience the same rate of decrease as before or even increase. In such a scenario, the cost of solar power technology in Mona's city would likely not decrease as rapidly or effectively as in cities where solar power knowledge and demand are on the rise. Ideally, the cost of technology should decrease as production becomes more efficient, technology gets mature, and market competition increases. However, in this particular case, with the declining demand, there would be fewer incentives for solar power producers and technology developers to keep investing in research, meaning reduced innovation, less competition, and less pressure to keep lowering costs. Unfortunately, this could lead to a higher cost of solar power technology for residents in Mona's city, compared to areas where demand is increasing and awareness is strong. Public policies, local government support, and businesses adapting to solar power could counter this issue to some extent. In conclusion, as the demand for solar power decreases in Mona's city due to the decrease in awareness among its citizens, the cost of the technology is likely to not decrease as much or may even increase compared to the cost in more solar-aware cities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: [i] yes; [ii] it is not possible to tell; [iii] no;","output":"[iii] No, we cannot conclude that \\"The prices go up towards the end of the day.\\" The given statement precisely informs us that prices begin to drop at the end of the day, after the tour groups leave, especially out of season. This implies a decrease in prices, rather than an increase. There could be various reasons supporting the drop of prices at the end of the day. One potential explanation is that sellers might want to clear their stock before closing, so they reduce the prices to attract more customers. Another reason could be that a majority of tourists leave at the end of the day, so the sellers reduce prices to entice remaining tourists or locals to make purchases. However, it is essential to note that prices may vary depending on different factors such as location, types of goods or services, and sellers' strategies. While the statement suggests that prices drop at the end of the day, it is not indicative of the price trend throughout the whole day – they might see an increase during peak hours or even right before the tour groups start leaving, for example.

The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. The nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water bodies. Since there is a lot of nitrogen it causes algae to grow out of control. Figure below shows a pond covered with algae. Algae may use up so much oxygen in the water that nothing else can grow. Soon, even the algae die out. Decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico.

Answer:","output":"Given the background information and the situation, Plum farm, which used conventional farming methods such as fertilizer and pesticides, likely caused more fertilizer to reach the ponds. This is because when it rains, the fertilizer applied at Plum farm would dissolve in the soil, and runoff would carry it away to end up in bodies of water, such as ponds.

It would not recharge. I finally threw it away and ordered the same thing from Kodak. Theirs works fine. It rated Zero stars. Answer:","output":"The mentioned review would significantly decrease the chances of me buying the product, and I would like to explain my reasoning in detail: 1. Negative Feedback: The review has an overall negative tone, and the customer seems to have had a negative experience with the product. The title \\"What A Winner\\" exhibits sarcasm, further highlighting the dissatisfaction with the item. A review with such a tone would generally deter potential buyers from purchasing the product. 2. Functional Issue: The reviewer points out a major functional issue in the product – it not being able to recharge properly. This is an essential requirement for a rechargeable item, failing to meet which would render it rather useless. A product that does not fulfill its basic function is likely to be a poor investment. 3. Comparison with another brand: The reviewer compares the product with one from Kodak and claims that Kodak's product works fine. This immediately generates a perception that the alternative brand may be superior, decreasing the chances of buying the reviewed product, and potentially directing potential buyers to consider the Kodak variant instead. 4. Zero-star rating: The reviewer explicitly rates the product as zero stars. A low rating like this should raise alarm bells for potential buyers, as it establishes that the reviewer did not find any redeeming qualities about the product. 5. Discarded product: The fact that the reviewer threw the product away, indicates that they felt there was no possibility of repairs or returns and found it unfit for any usage. This adds to the impression that the product lacks durability and has poor quality, further decreasing the probability of buying it based on this review. In summary, upon considering the review's negative feedback, functional issue, comparison with another brand, zero-star rating, and the fact that it was discarded, it is clear that the review would significantly reduce the chances of buying the product. Before making a decision, it is critical to consider other reviews and gather more information on the product, as this particular review could be just one of the many opinions out there.

Step 2: Compare the elements in both the premise and hypothesis. - Construction equipment requirements - Modest requirements - Systems installed at the back end of the facility - Close to the ground Step 3: Analyze if the premise supports the hypothesis. The premise specifies that FGD installations have modest construction equipment requirements due to their location at the back end of the facility and close to the ground. The hypothesis makes a general claim that systems installed at the back end of the facility and close to the ground typically have modest construction equipment requirements. Step 4: Determine the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. By comparing the premise and hypothesis, it can be inferred that the premise supports the hypothesis, at least in the case of FGD installations. However, the hypothesis makes a broader claim about systems in general, not just FGD installations. Therefore, the premise provides evidence for the hypothesis, but it does not conclusively prove it for all systems or scenarios. Conclusion: The premise supports the hypothesis for FGD installations, but it does not provide complete evidence to confirm the hypothesis for all systems that are installed at the back end of a facility and close to the ground. Further examples and analysis would be required to make a more definitive statement about the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is aimed primarily at the 1529 age group, although the average age of the UK audience in 2008 was 33. BBC Radio 1 started 24-hour broadcasting on 1 May 1991.  - MTV2 (formerly M2) is an American digital cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Global Entertainment Group, a unit of the Viacom Media Networks division of Viacom. The channel was initially broadcast over-the-air in selected markets, where the former all-request music channel known as The Box was broadcast. The channel was originally launched as a constant commercial-free music video channel, much like the original MTV channel; but once MTV started to change its focus from music to reality television in the 2000s, MTV2's focus changed as well, thus bringing music video programming away from both MTV and MTV2. Today, MTV2 broadcasts unscripted programming and syndicated television episodes from MTV and other networks.  - Satellite television is  according to \\"article 1.39\\" of the International Telecommunication Unions (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR)  a \\"Broadcasting-satellite service\\".  - A music video is a short film integrating a song and imagery, produced for promotional or artistic purposes. Modern music videos are primarily made and used as a marketing device intended to promote the sale of music recordings. There are also cases where songs are used in tie in marketing campaigns that allow them to become more than just a song. Tie ins and merchandising could be used in toys or marketing campaigns for food and other products. Although the origins of music videos date back to musical short films that first appeared in the 1920s, they came into prominence in the 1980s when MTV based their format around the medium. Prior to the 1980s, these works were described by various terms including \\"illustrated song\\", \\"filmed insert\\", \\"promotional (promo) film\\", \\"promotional clip\\", \\"promotional video\\", \\"song video\\", \\"song clip\\" or \\"film clip\\". Since the creation and increased popularity of YouTube, mainstream artists now promote new music videos by releasing trailers of short promos on the site for their upcoming song and music video. Consequentially, YouTube has been converted into a social media platform for celebrities and artists to market themselves to their fans  - New Musical Express (NME) is a British music journalism magazine published since 1952. It was the first British paper to include a singles chart, in the edition of 14 November 1952. In the 1970s it became the best-selling British music newspaper. During the period 1972 to 1976, it was particularly associated with gonzo journalism, then became closely associated with punk rock through the writings of Julie Burchill, Paul Morley and Tony Parsons. It started as a music newspaper, and gradually moved toward a magazine format during the 1980s and 1990s, changing from newsprint in 1998.  - Viacom Media Networks (formerly MTV Networks) is an American mass media division of Viacom that oversees the operations of many of its television channels and Internet brands, including Nickelodeon, BET, CMT, Comedy Central, VH1 and the original MTV channel in the United States. Its sister international division is Viacom International Media Networks.  - Gordon Peter Moakes (born 22 June 1976) is an English musician, best known as the bassist of rock band Young Legionnaire and former member of indie rock band Bloc Party.  - MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City. Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years.  - Reality television is a genre of television programming that documents supposedly unscripted real-life situations, and often features an otherwise unknown cast of individuals who are typically not professional actors, although in some shows celebrities may participate. It differs from documentary television in that the focus tends to be on drama, personal conflict, and entertainment rather than educating viewers. The genre has various standard tropes, including \\"confessionals\\" (also called \\"talking heads\\" or \\"interview segments\\") used by cast members to express their thoughts, which often double as the shows' narration. In competition-based reality shows, a notable subset, there are other common elements such as one participant being eliminated per episode, a panel of judges, and the concept of \\"immunity from elimination.\\"  - Digital cable is any type of cable television distribution using digital video compression for USE. The technology was originally developed by General Instrument before being acquired by Motorola and subsequently acquired by ARRIS Group. Cable companies converted to digital systems during the 2000s, around the time that television signals were converted to the digital HDTV format, which was not compatible with earlier analog cable systems. In addition to providing higher resolution HD video, digital cable systems provide expanded services such as pay-per-view programming, cable internet access and cable telephone services. Most digital cable signals are encrypted, which reduced the high incidence of cable theft which occurred in analog systems.   - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - The UK Albums Chart (currently called the Official Albums Chart) is a list of albums ranked by physical and digital sales and (from March 2015) audio streaming in the United Kingdom. It was published for the first time on 22 July 1956 and is compiled every week by the Official Charts Company (OCC) on Fridays (previously Sundays). It is broadcast on BBC Radio 1 (top 5) and published in \\"Music Week\\" magazine (top 75), and on the OCC website (top 100).  - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.  - Bloc Party are an English indie rock band, currently composed of Kele Okereke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards, sampler), Russell Lissack (lead guitar, keyboards), Justin Harris (bass guitar, keyboards, saxophones, backing vocals) and Louise Bartle (drums, percussion). Former members Matt Tong and Gordon Moakes left the band in 2013 and 2015 respectively. Their brand of music, whilst rooted in rock, retains elements of other genres such as electronica and house music. The band was formed at the 1999 Reading Festival by Okereke and Lissack. They went through a variety of names before settling on Bloc Party in 2003. Moakes joined the band after answering an advert in \\"NME\\" magazine, while Tong was picked via an audition. Bloc Party got their break by giving BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq and Franz Ferdinand's lead singer, Alex Kapranos, a copy of their demo \\"She's Hearing Voices\\".  - The Irish Albums Chart is the Irish music industry standard albums popularity chart issued weekly by the Irish Recorded Music Association and compiled on its behalf by Chart-Track. Chart rankings are based on sales, which are compiled through over-the-counter retail data captured electronically each day from retailers' Point of sale systems and certain digital retailers. All major record stores and over forty independents submit data for the charts, accounting for over 80% of the market, according to Chart-Track. A new chart is compiled and released to the public by the Irish Recorded Music Association on Friday at noon. Each chart is dated with the \\"week-ending\\" date of the previous Thursday (i.e., the day before issue).  - House music is a genre of electronic music created by club DJs and music producers that originated in Chicago in the early 1980s. Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive 4/4 beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalistic, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. House music initially became popular in Chicago clubs in 1984, pioneered by figures such as Frankie Knuckles, Phuture, Kym Mazelle, and Mr. Fingers, and was associated with African-American and gay subcultures. House music quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, New York City, Baltimore, and Newark  all of which developed their own regional scenes. In the mid-to-late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America, and Australia.  - YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California. The service was created by three former PayPal employeesChad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karimin February 2005. In November 2006, it was bought by Google for US1.65 billion. YouTube now operates as one of Google's subsidiaries. The site allows users to upload, view, rate, share, add to favorites, report and comment on videos, and it makes use of WebM, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, and Adobe Flash Video technology to display a wide variety of user-generated and corporate media videos.

So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . .  the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle. Question: Why should goals be set Options: - because it makes you work   - because it gives you incentive   - not enough information   - Because it shows progress === The correct answer is The answer to this question is:","output":"Because setting goals gives you an incentive, a clear direction, and a way to measure progress. Having goals keeps you motivated and focused on achieving them, especially when it comes to weight loss. It allows you to track your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your diet or exercise routine. When you reach a goal, it provides a sense of accomplishment and motivation to continue working towards your ultimate weight loss goal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are the full names of the people who succeed in repairing an aircraft?  The US Army is conducting a fighting retreat. A high bridge spans a ravine on the Bataan Peninsula. After the army and some civilians cross, a group of thirteen hastily assembled soldiers from different units is assigned to blow it up and delay Japanese rebuilding efforts as long as possible. They dig in on a hillside, setting up heavy machine guns in sandbag fortifications. They succeed in blowing up the bridge, but their commander, Captain Henry Lassiter, is killed by a sniper, leaving Sergeant Dane in charge. One by one, the defenders are killed, while Ramirez succumbs to malaria. Despite this, the outnumbered soldiers doggedly hold their position. Malloy shoots down a Japanese aircraft with his Tommy gun before being killed. Dane and Todd creep up, undetected, on the partially rebuilt bridge and throw Mk 2 hand grenades, blowing it up.  There is also tension between Dane and Todd. Dane suspects that Todd is a soldier from his past named Danny Burns who was arrested for killing a man in a dispute, but escaped while Dane was guarding him. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Steve Bentley and his Filipino mechanic, Corporal Juan Katigbak, work frantically to repair a Beechcraft C-43 Traveler aircraft. They succeed, but Katigbak is killed and Bentley is mortally wounded. Dying, he has explosives loaded aboard and crashes the C-43 into the bridge's foundation, destroying it for a third time. The remaining soldiers repel a massive frontal assault, inflicting heavy losses and ultimately fighting hand-to-hand with bayonets fixed on their M1903 Springfield rifles. Epps and Feingold are killed, leaving only Dane, Todd, and a wounded Purckett alive. Purckett is shot, while Todd stabbed through the back by a Japanese soldier who had only feigned being dead. Before he dies, Todd admits to Dane he is Burns.

The Dutch Take Over: Intent on capturing a piece of the Portuguese trade in pepper and other spices, the Java-based Dutch Ailied with the Malays in 1633 to blockade Melaka. The trade blockade was to last eight years, and ended in a seven-month siege. The Portuguese surrendered in 1641, wracked by malaria and dysentery and denied their usual reinforcements from Goa. By then, the city had become a stagnant backwater. Unlike the Portuguese, the Dutch decided to do business with the Malays of Johor, who controlled the southern half of the peninsula together with Singapore and the neighboring Riau islands. A trade treaty gave the Dutch command of the spice trade but reserved Johor's rights in tin exports from Perak, Selangor, and Klang. Without ever retrieving the supremacy of the old Melaka sultanate, Johor had become the strongest Asian power in the region. For the Dutch, Johor provided a buffer against other Europeans. Meanwhile, fresh blood came in with the migration into the southern interior of hardy Minangkabau farmers from Sumatra, while tough Bugis warriors from the east Indonesian Celebes (Sulawesi) roved the length and breadth of the peninsula. The Minangkabau custom of freely electing their leaders provided the model for rulership elections in modern federal Malaysia. Their confederation of States became today's Negeri Sembilan (\\"Nine States\\"), with Seremban as its capital. The name Minangkabau itself means roughly \\"buffalo horns\\" and is reflected in the distinctive upward curving roof in museums and government offices built in the traditional Minangkabau style. The Bugis were energetic merchants and great sailors. With the Dutch concentrating once more on Java and the Moluccas in the 18th century, the Bugis took advantage of the vacuum by raiding Perak and Kedah, imposing their chieftains in Selangor and becoming the power behind the throne in Johor. The Bugis in Johor's administration provided much of the spirit in that State's independent stand in the 19th and 20th centuries. Throughout this period, the east coast states enjoyed a relatively tranquil prosperity, Terengganu notably thriving from its textile industry and trading in pepper and gold with the Thais, Cambodians, and Chinese. The British, under the private auspices of the East India Company (EIC), were beginning to poke their noses into North Borneo.

Write some highlights for the following article: Princess Stephanie of Monaco can't keep away from the circus - she spent a third night at the International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo yesterday evening. Wearing a smart long leather jacket, Stephanie, 49, was presented with a bunch of flowers by the a cast of clowns, who all seemed incredibly happy to see her again. The Princess is a huge supporter of the circus and appeared delighted to greet the colourful performers, who were decked out in their best costumes. Scroll down for video. What a gang: Wearing a long black coat Princess Stephanie of Monaco spent her third day at the International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo. Sealed with a kiss: Princess Stephanie was greeted by the ring master who gently kissed her hand. The Princess looked radiant on the evening, wearing her long dark hair down around her shoulders, while a lacy top peeked out from underneath her coat. For the second night in a row, Princess Stephanie was treated to a kiss on the hand from ringmaster Petit Gougou during the show. She attended the event with her youngest daughter Camille, who recently celebrated her 16th birthday. Controversy surrounded Camille's birth in 1998 as Stephanie neglected to name a father on her birth certificate. As such, Camille is not included in the line to the Monegasque throne, unlike her brother Louis Robert and her sister Pauline Grace. It was rumoured at the time that her father was Jean-Raymond Gottlieb who was Princess Stephanie's former body guard, but nothing has ever been confirmed. Natural beauty: Princess Stephanie looked radiant on her night out at the circus wearing a bright red lipstick. Like mother, like daughter: Princess Stephanie attended the event yesterday evening with her look-a-like daughter Camille, pictured in the red patterned jacket. Clowning around: As Stephanie posed for a photograph one of the performers tried to chat with her. Just the day before her trip with Camille, the Princess had also attended the circus for a rare night out with her brother Prince Albert of Monaco. Beaming broadly as a spiky haired Italian clown named Fumagali approached, Prince Albert was clearly in a good mood as he enjoyed the evening. The festival is an annual event in the principality and has been running since 1974. But while Albert and Stephanie appeared to be enjoy the show, the newest additions to Monaco's royal family were nowhere to be seen. New mother Princess Charlene was absent, having chosen to remain at home with month-old twins, Jacques Honoré Rainier and Gabriella Thérèse Marie. All smiles: Prince Albert and Princess Stephanie enjoy the antics of Italian clown Fumagalli. What a gentleman! Ringmaster Petit Gougou plants a kiss on Stephanie's outstretched hand. Their absence didn't prevent Prince Albert from enjoying himself, although the event did briefly take a sombre turn at the beginning of the night. Part way through the opening ceremony, a minute's silence was held in memory of stunt rider Kevin Ferrari, a.k.a Flic Flac Moto X, 24, who was killed during an accident in rehearsals on Wednesday. Despite his death, the show continued after the minute's silence with elephants, acrobats and clowns all on the billing. Royal approval: The clown, real name Giovanni Huesca, raised smiles all round. Round of applause: Albert, who was taking a night off from daddy duties, claps at the end of the performance. Welcome: New father Albert also got a round of applause of his own and waved at the crowd appreciatively. Looking good: Despite having two tiny babies to care for, Albert looked surprisingly fresh. Royal wave: Albert waves to the Monte Carlo crowd from the comfort of the royal box. Tribute: Ahead of the performance, there was a minute's silence for a performer who died earlier this week. The prince  certainly appeared to enjoy rest of the show though, gasping in delight as a daredevil stunt rider appeared and threw himself into the air from the back of his galloping horse. At the time Stephanie, who is patron of the International Circus Festival, was making her second visit to the Big Top in a week, having already met clowns and elephant trainers on Tuesday. During that visit, the 49-year-old, who eloped with an elephant trainer in 2000, was seen patting one of the circus' pachyderms, looking unruffled as it began waving its trunk. The royal, who also helps to oversee the Circus Festival and is involved in everything from choosing the acts to the choreography, first attended the event when she was just nine. Her father Prince Ranier was the brains behind the first festival, which now as then, specialises in traditional circus acts  from clowns to acrobats. Left at home: Princess Charlene chose to remain at the Palais Princier along with the baby twins. Glamorous: The chic 36-year-old was last seen on the 7th January when the babies were presented. Daredevil: A member of Russian group Yakov Ekk performs in front of the royal box. Ouch! An Asian elephant trained by Elvis Errani shows off his dexterity during the performance. Amazing: Equilibrist acrobats from China's National Acrobatic Troupe show off their impressive skills. Awe inspiring: An Asian elephant completes its turn as do Russians Elena Petrikova and Elena Baranenko. Magnificent: Russian equine troupe Yakov Ekk wave a Monaco national flag during the finale of their act. Highlights:","output":"Princess Stephanie of Monaco loves going to the circus!

Article: Epidemiologic studies have reported conflicting results on the relationship between daytime napping and mortality risk, and there are few data on the potential association in the British population. We investigated the associations between daytime napping and all-cause or cause-specific mortality in the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer-Norfolk study, a British population-based cohort study. Among the 16,374 men and women who answered questions on napping habits between 1998 and 2000, a total of 3,251 died during the 13-year follow-up. Daytime napping was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (for napping less than 1 hour per day on average, hazard ratio = 1.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.27; for napping 1 hour or longer per day on average, hazard ratio = 1.32, 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.68), independent of age, sex, social class, educational level, marital status, employment status, body mass index, physical activity level, smoking status, alcohol intake, depression, self-reported general health, use of hypnotic drugs or other medications, time spent in bed at night, and presence of preexisting health conditions. This association was more pronounced for death from respiratory diseases (for napping less than 1 hour, hazard ratio = 1.40, 95% confidence interval: 0.95, 2.05; for napping 1 hour or more, hazard ratio = 2.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.34, 4.86) and in individuals 65 years of age or younger. Excessive daytime napping might be a useful marker of underlying health risk, particularly of respiratory problems, especially among those 65 years of age or younger. Further research is required to clarify the nature of the observed association.      Most previous studies have come from Mediterranean countries ( 10 – 13 ), in which the incidence of and rate of death from CVD tend to be low ( 6 ). Several prospective cohort studies from Israel showed that an increased mortality rate was associated with siesta among older people ( 10 , 11 ), whereas 1 study from Greece suggested that the siesta is protective against heart-related deaths, especially in working men ( 12 ). In addition, conflicting United States–based research has found an increased risk of death associated with daytime napping in both men only ( 14 ) and women only ( 15 ). In both studies, only naps of long durations were found to be significant. A Japanese study suggested that daytime napping was associated with increased risks of all-cause and CVD mortality, but this association was largely explained by comorbid conditions ( 16 ). Meanwhile, there is limited evidence from the British population. Although daytime napping has not been a tradition among British adults, the prevalence of napping is likely to increase with the rapidly aging population ( 17 , 18 ), and it is therefore important to understand the health associations of daytime napping among the British.      In recent years, there has been growing evidence of a relationship between habitual sleep and the risk of mortality from all-causes and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) ( 1 – 3 ). Most of these studies focused on nighttime sleep duration ( 4 , 5 ); the implications of daytime napping are poorly understood. A long-established practice in Mediterranean areas, daytime napping, namely siesta, is often linked with good health through a postulated “stress relief” mechanism ( 6 ). However, daytime sleepiness, often characterized by daytime napping, has been suggested as an early sign or risk indicator of a range of health problems ( 7 – 9 ). To date, the association between daytime napping and mortality risk is uncertain.      Finally, we performed stratified analysis with adjustment for all the covariates according to follow-up length and preexisting health conditions and according to potential effect modifiers: age (≤65 vs. >65 years old), sex, smoking status (ever vs. never smoker), employment status, BMI (dichotomized using the median), MDD, time spent in bed at night (dichotomized using the median), and nighttime sleep duration (reported in hours at the time of the third health check). Hazard ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated using no napping as the reference group (with adjustment for sex through inclusion of sex-specific baseline hazards). The overall associations between the 2 categories of napping and mortality were tested using the likelihood ratio test. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and a P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were implemented in Stata, version 12.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).      The associations between daytime napping and all-cause or disease-specific mortality were examined using Cox proportional hazards regression models that were adjusted for covariates. The endpoints were grouped into death from all causes, CVD, cancer, respiratory diseases, and all other causes. We firstly examined the proportional hazard assumption using both a Kaplan-Meier plot and Schoenfeld's test, and no sign of violation was found for any endpoint. All covariates were chosen a priori based on the literature and their relevance to napping and health. Models were constructed with progressive adjustment of the covariates to show the associations explained by the covariates: 1) Model A was adjusted for age and sex; 2) model B was further adjusted for social class, educational level, marital status, employment status, BMI, physical activity level, smoking status, and alcohol intake; 3) model C was adjusted for the variables in model B and MDD, self-reported general health, time spent in bed at night, hypnotic drug use, antidepressant use, and COPD drug use; and 4) model D was further adjusted for the variables in all models and preexisting health conditions. Each multivariable model was built on persons for whom we had complete measurements of all covariates.      Participants were flagged for death certification at the United Kingdom Office of National Statistics so that we were notified of their deaths, with vital status established for the whole cohort. The current analysis presents deaths that occurred during followed up from January 2000 and until December 2012. Deaths were coded initially according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Ninth Revision, and later the Tenth Revision. The underlying cause of death was categorized as due to CVD (ICD-9 codes 401–448 or ICD-10 codes I10–I79), cancer (ICD-9 codes 140–208 or ICD-10 codes C00–C97), or respiratory diseases (ICD–9 codes 460–496 or ICD-10 codes J00–J99).      Covariates measured closer in time to the measurement of napping were chosen and included those measured at baseline or at the time of the second health check (1998–2000). Covariates measured at baseline were social class (professionals, managerial and technical occupations, skilled workers subdivided into nonmanual and manual, partly skilled workers, or unskilled manual workers), educational level (highest qualification attained: no qualifications, educated to age 16 years, educated to age 18 years, or educated to degree level), and physical activity level (inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active, or active) ( 22 ). Body mass index (BMI; weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was measured at the baseline health check. Other covariates were reported in questionnaires during the time of the second health check: age, marital status (single, married, widowed, separated, or divorced), employment status (working or not working), smoking status (current, former, or nonsmokers), alcohol intake (units of alcohol drunk per week), self-reported general health (excellent, good, moderate, or poor), use of hypnotic drugs (yes or no), antidepressant use (yes or no), use of drugs to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (yes or no), major depressive disorder (MDD) in the previous year (yes or no) ( 23 ), and time spent in bed at night (in hours, derived from the differences between reported rise times and bedtimes). Hypnotic drug use was defined according to the British National Formulary (section 4.1) ( 24 ) and included benzodiazepines, zaleplon, zolpidem, and zopiclone, chloral and its derivatives, clomethiazole, and antihistamines. Preexisting health conditions included self-reported stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes, cancer, asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema, as well as a proxy measure of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), with persons who were in the highest BMI quartile and who reported taking antihypertension drugs being defined as likely to have underlying OSA.      During 1998–2000, a total of 16,374 participants completed the following question in the health questionnaire: “Do you normally take a nap during the day?” If they answered in the affirmative, they were asked to categorize the duration of their nap (<1 hour or ≥1 hour). Napping habits were thereby summarized as: no napping, napping less than 1 hour, and napping 1 hour or more per day.      Data were drawn from the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk prospective cohort study. The design and study methods of EPIC-Norfolk have been described previously ( 20 , 21 ). Briefly, 25,639 men and women aged 40–79 years were recruited using general practice age-sex registers from Norfolk, United Kingdom, and attended a baseline health check during 1993–1997. These participants were then followed up for 2 further health checks from 1996 to 2000 and from 2006 to 2011. In between these health examinations, participants were sent questionnaires for completion and return by post. The Norwich District Ethics Committee approved the study, and all participants gave signed informed consent.      A total of 3,251 deaths (1,034 from CVD, 1,213 from cancer, 286 from respiratory diseases, and 718 from all other causes) were observed during the 13-year follow-up. There were 1,795 deaths in men and 1,456 in women. Table 3 shows the adjusted hazard ratios associated with napping. After adjustment for age and sex, daytime napping was associated with a 22% increase in the risk of all-cause mortality in persons who napped less than 1 hour (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13, 1.31) and a 54% increase for persons who napped 1 hour or longer (HR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.31, 1.81). The hazard ratios were attenuated to 1.14 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.27) for napping less than 1 hour and 1.34 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.68) for napping 1 hour or longer after further adjustment for social class, educational level, marital status, employment status, BMI, physical activity level, smoking status, alcohol intake, MDD, self-reported general health, hypnotic drug use, antidepressant and COPD drug use, and time spent in bed at night. This association was little changed after additional adjustment for preexisting health conditions, with a 14% and 32% increase in all-cause mortality risk among those who napped for less than 1 hour or 1 hour or more per day, respectively. This association was more pronounced for death from respiratory diseases (for napping <1 hour, HR = 1.40, 95% CI: 0.95, 2.05; for napping ≥1 hour, HR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.34, 4.86). No statistically significant associations were observed for death from other causes after full adjustments. Table 4 shows results from stratified analysis for all-cause mortality. The association was stronger in those who were younger (for napping <1 hour, HR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.79; for napping ≥1 hour, HR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.16, 3.28; P for interaction = 0.04 for persons 42–65 years of age compared with those 65–82 years of age) and in those who had a lower BMI (for napping <1 hour, HR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.56; for napping ≥1 hour, HR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.21, 2.45; P for interaction = 0.02 for those with a BMI of 15.2–25.7 compared with those with a BMI of higher than 25.7). In addition, there was a suggestion that this association was stronger in persons who reported experiencing MDD in the past 12 months (for napping ≥1 hour, HR = 2.90, 95% CI: 1.12, 7.50; P for interaction = 0.13) and in those who were working (for napping ≥1 hour, HR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.16, 5.20; P for interaction = 0.33). No statistically significant differences were observed by sex, cigarette smoking history, time spent in bed at night, nighttime sleep duration, or preexisting health conditions (among those who reported no preexisting CVD, cancer, asthma, bronchitis, or underlying sleep apnea at baseline and who napped for ≥1 hour, HR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.93). Furthermore, there was no evidence that the association attenuated with increasing length of follow-up (in these data, the association was stronger after 6.5 years of follow-up; P for interaction = 0.07).      During 1998–2000, napping during the day was reported by 2,653 of 7,161 men (37.0%) and 2,228 of 9,213 women (24.2%). Tables 1 and 2 show participants' baseline characteristics by napping habits. Among the persons who took naps, only 10% napped for more than 1 hour per day. Those who took naps were more likely to be men and were on average 6 years older than those who did not nap. Persons who took naps were more likely to be smokers, not working, and less active and to have a lower educational level, higher BMI, and poor self-reported general health. The above associations were all stronger for those who napped for longer time periods.      DISCUSSION      In the present large sample of middle- to older-aged British adults, daytime napping of 1 hour per day or more was associated with a 32% increase in the risk all-cause mortality during the 13-year follow-up. This association was independent of age, sex, social class, educational level, marital status, employment status, BMI, physical activity level, smoking status, alcohol intake, MDD, self-reported general health, time spent in bed at night, hypnotic drug use, antidepressant use, COPD drug use, and preexisting health conditions and was similar among men and women. The associations were more pronounced for deaths from respiratory illness and for participants who were 65 years of age or younger. Furthermore, the association between napping and all-cause mortality remained among those without preexisting health conditions and did not attenuate with increasing length of follow-up.      To our knowledge, this is the first study to present in detail the association between daytime napping and cause-specific mortality in a British population. Strengths of our study include the long follow-up and range of measures for which we were able to adjust. Our study has several limitations. First, 16,374 of the 25,639 participants at baseline completed the subsequent mailed questionnaire that contained the napping question. Compared with the rest of the participants, these 16,374 people were more likely to be women and to have a higher social class and educational level. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to populations with lower socioeconomic status. Second, the information on napping was obtained from self-report. Previous studies (25, 26) have shown a tendency for older people to underreport napping behaviors, and this may lead to underestimation of the association. It was suggested that naps of less than 30 minutes (usually known as power naps) can be largely beneficial, especially among shift workers (27–29), whereas naps longer than 30 minutes can cause sleep inertia and are usually not recommended (30). Napping duration was categorized into less than 1 hour and 1 hour or more in our questionnaire, and we were therefore unable to differentiate the effects of power naps from those of excessive napping. Although this might have diluted the overall association, we conclude from the current study that there is an increased health risk associated with excessive daytime napping.      Voluntary naps and naps as a result of underlying pathology have different implications for health, and identification of the reasons for the naps is crucial. Although a range of preexisting health conditions and medication use was considered in this study, we cannot rule out that our results may be partly explained by the effects of other undiagnosed health problems or medications not included in this study that might cause daytime fatigue or sleepiness. Daytime napping might be a consequence of nighttime sleep disturbance, which has been associated with an increased risk of death (31). Although the detailed purpose of napping was not recorded in the present study, the association between daytime napping and mortality risk did not change by nighttime sleep durations and was independent of time spent in bed at night, which has been suggested to be a good indicator of nighttime sleep patterns in the EPIC-Norfolk population (32). In addition, a surrogate measure of OSA was included in regression models to help address the problem. This measure combines BMI and hypertension, 2 strong correlates of OSA (33–35). The surrogate measure may partly reflect the probability of having OSA; therefore, further studies with more precise measures of OSA and nighttime sleep quality are required to confirm whether the association stands independent of other sleep parameters.      Our findings are consistent with most previous studies that have reported an association between self-reported daytime napping and increased all-cause mortality (10, 11, 14–16, 36, 37). These studies covered populations from the Mediterranean, Japan, and the United States and included primarily older populations. The largest published report to date came from the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study, in which a total of 9,643 deaths were recorded and daytime napping was found to be associated with increased mortality from specific causes, particularly CVD (16). Indeed, most previous studies have related daytime napping to increased CVD mortality risk (10, 15, 16, 37). In our study, the association between napping and CVD mortality risk was largely explained by MDD in the previous year. MDD is commonly associated with sleep disturbance, which might lead to excessive daytime napping. Previous evidence based upon our cohort (23) has shown major depression to be associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease mortality, though understanding of this association remains elusive. It is possible that the association between napping and CVD mortality is mostly explained by depression or MDD reported within a certain time frame. Future studies would need to carefully examine the role of depression in the napping-mortality association.      At the same time, several earlier studies (6, 12) from Mediterranean populations have suggested different findings. The Greek EPIC cohort study, which is methodologically comparable to our study, found napping to be protective against coronary mortality (12). Notably, the Greek cohort included people who were 20–86 years of age at baseline, whereas our participants were exclusively middle- to older-aged adults. Moreover, the association was particularly strong among working men in their study, which might be explained by the possible stress-releasing effect of afternoon naps (12). This effect could have been masked in our aging population, who are mostly retired and might take naps for other purposes, such as compensating for declining physical functions. Interestingly, in our study, the positive association between napping and mortality was seen to be stronger among persons 65 years of age or younger than among those older than 65 years of age (65 years is the age by which most people have retired from work in the United Kingdom). It is often believed that napping is protective for younger populations and problematic for older ones (12, 19, 37). Notably, the average age of our participants at baseline was 62 years, so the younger persons in the present study were not comparable to those mentioned in earlier studies (12, 38). Although it is unknown why the association was stronger among those 65 years of age or younger, our finding raises the possibility that napping might be more indicative of mortality risk in this population, and this needs to be confirmed by further studies. Unlike in previous studies (14, 36), no evident sex difference was observed in this study.      In the present study, we found large effect sizes for the association between napping and death from respiratory disease even though there were much fewer respiratory deaths than CVD and cancer deaths. The association was independent of smoking status, preexisting respiratory diseases, and COPD drug use. This is surprising given the lack of evidence of the associations between napping and respiratory health. Although none of the previous studies highlighted the association between napping and respiratory mortality, most of them did suggest the association with non-CVD/non-cancer mortality (10, 15, 16), and these categories were largely made up of respiratory mortality in our study. The reason why daytime napping may increase respiratory mortality is not known, but it is worth noting the interrelationship between the cardiovascular and respiratory systems (39). Although we failed to find an association between napping and CVD mortality, the napping-respiratory association might not be separate from the cardiovascular consequences of sleep problems (e.g., OSA). It seems reasonable to suggest that persons with respiratory problems (especially hypoxic conditions) were more likely to nap and were also more likely to die of respiratory disease because of their underlying problems. The incidence of OSA was not recorded directly in this study, and a proxy measure was used to account for the effects. Given the close link between OSA and mortality (40, 41), daytime napping might well be a good surrogate measure of OSA, which is potentially important for early detection of OSA in the general population.      Although in this study the association between napping and all-cause mortality remained after excluding participants with known preexisting health conditions at baseline, it remains possible that daytime napping is simply a marker of undiagnosed health problems and of reverse causation, with those individuals who have undiagnosed ill health napping more. In this case, we would expect attenuation in the association whereby it is stronger in the immediate period of follow-up and lessens thereafter. However, the association seemed to be even stronger among those with a follow-up length of 6.5 years or more. Interestingly, the association was stronger among persons with a lower BMI. Although the exact reason for this observation is unclear, it is worth noting the “obesity paradox,” which might have been brought about by existing physiological or pathological changes (42, 43). It is possible that persons with lower BMI could have been suffering from underlying illnesses that led to weight loss and that this added to the health risk conveyed by daytime napping.      In the United Kingdom, daytime napping is not part of the cultural norm, and in the absence of obvious disruptions in nighttime sleep patterns, it remains plausible that napping might be an early sign of system disregulation and a marker of future health problems. Alternatively, there may be a biological mechanism through which napping is associated with mortality, for example, through inflammatory pathways, especially increased chronic low-grade inflammation. Increased levels of inflammation have been suggested for persons with reduced nighttime sleep durations (44), but we are unaware of any evidence to show an association between daytime napping and inflammation. Our findings need confirmation from further population studies that include examination of the relationship between napping and physiological biomarkers. This further work could help evaluate whether there is a causal link between napping and mortality risk or whether napping is a marker of system disregulation or of undiagnosed respiratory problems that lead to an increased risk of future ill health.      In summary, independent associations were found between daytime napping and an increased risk of mortality from all causes and respiratory diseases in a large population-based middle- to older-aged British cohort. The association remained after exclusion of persons who died within the first 6.5 years of follow-up and was more pronounced for people 65 years of age or younger. The exact mechanisms of these associations remain unknown. Further studies are needed before any recommendations can be made. Excessive daytime napping might be a useful marker of underlying health risks, particularly respiratory problems, especially among those 65 years of age or younger. ||||| Why taking an afternoon nap 'raises risk of an EARLY DEATH by a third'      Adults who nap are more likely develop deadly respiratory issues      Scientists say napping can trigger inflammation in the body      The findings from say dozing could be a symptom of lung disease      Napping, once thought of as a harmless way to recharge one's batteries throughout the day, could now have deadly effects      It seems a pretty harmless occupation, but taking an afternoon nap can knock years off your life, say researchers.      British adults who sleep for an hour or more in the day increased the chances of premature death by almost a third, scientists found.      The biggest risks appear to be associated with lung diseases, such as bronchitis, emphysema and pneumonia.      Adults who nap every day are up to two-and-a-half times more likely to die from respiratory illnesses than those who don’t.      Researchers said that this could be because napping triggers inflammation in the body.      However, the findings, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, also suggested that dozing during the day could be a signal that the person already has lung disease.      Experts at Cambridge tracked more than 16,000 British men and women over 13 years.      They studied adults who, in the late nineties, signed up to a major research project investigating the effects of diet and lifestyle on cancer.            As part of the project, volunteers gave details of their sleeping habits – including whether they took a nap in the day.      Researchers then followed them up for 13 years and recorded the number of deaths – just over 3,000 – and what caused them.      When they matched mortality rates with sleeping habits, they found the risk of death increased slightly by about 14 per cent in people who dozed less than an hour in the day.      But if their naps lasted more than an hour, the risks increased by 32 per cent.      When they looked at causes of death, they found the chances of dying from a respiratory illness more than doubled if naps lasted over an hour.      The chance of death of those who napped among 16,000 people increased by around 32 per cent      But the report added: ‘It remains plausible that napping might be an early sign of system disregulation and a marker of future health problems.’      Professor Jim Horne, from the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University, said short naps can still be a major help.      He said: ‘The findings actually show that the great majority – about 85 per cent – of those people who napped less than one hour were at no greater risk.’      He said it is possible that people in the study with serious and incurable lung illnesses might even have benefited from snoozing in the day and that napping ‘may not have hastened death but delayed it’.      Last year, a study in China – where taking a post-lunch snooze is very popular – found napping for more than 30 minutes at a time raised the chances of developing type two diabetes.      But scientists could not be sure that it wasn’t hidden diabetes that made people sleep, rather than napping triggering the disease. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Taking daytime naps of 1 hour or more has been found to increase the risk of premature death by almost a third, according to a study of more than 16,000 participants by Cambridge University. The study found that the biggest risks appeared to be associated with lung diseases such as bronchitis, emphysema, and pneumonia, with those who napped every day up to 2.5 times more likely to die from respiratory illnesses than those who didn't nap. Researchers suggested that this could be due to the fact that napping triggers inflammation in the body, or alternatively, that napping during the day could be a signal that the individual may already have lung disease."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A good hour of this movie in the middle has is filled with dialogue, an absense of action, the lack of devloping a tangent plot, pretty much NOTHING to do with the premise we are exposed to. It has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy, and the boy with his conspiracy group in which the producer/director dedicated no time in elbaorating, and yet dedicated a portion of the film dragging the issue. Would of been much better off if they had just cut that whole hour and developed the story in itself through another film and focus on the martial arts aspect.

Write an article that answers the following question: What did Zrinski do first, destroy the bridge, or attempt to conquer Nagykanizsa?","output":"Title: The Adventures of Zrinski: Bridge Destruction or Nagykanizsa Conquest? Hello little friends! Today, we will learn about a brave man named Zrinski, who lived a long, long time ago. His full name was Nikola Zrinski, and he was a very important person in a place called Croatia. People looked up to him because he was smart, brave, and a strong leader. One day, Zrinski had to make some difficult decisions. There were two things that he had to do: destroy a big bridge and try to conquer a town called Nagykanizsa. But which one did he do first? Let's find out together! First, let's talk about the bridge. There was a giant, strong bridge that connected two land areas, and many people used it to travel back and forth. But, the enemies were using the bridge too! So, Zrinski thought that if he could destroy the bridge, it would help keep his people safe from the bad guys. Next, there was a town named Nagykanizsa. It was a very important town, and Zrinski wanted to conquer it. \\"Conquer\\" means to take control of a place so that it belongs to you. Zrinski wanted to do this because he believed it would help protect and make his people even stronger. Now that we know about the two choices, let's see which one happened first. Zrinski was very smart and knew that sometimes it's better to do one task before another. So, he decided to destroy the big bridge first! He thought that it would make it harder for the enemies to come and attack while he tried to conquer Nagykanizsa. Once the bridge was destroyed, Zrinski and his brave friends moved forward to try and conquer Nagykanizsa. They fought very hard, but sometimes things don't always go as planned, so they couldn't fully control the town. So, little friends, the answer to our question is that Zrinski destroyed the bridge first, before attempting to conquer Nagykanizsa. We can learn from Zrinski's story that sometimes we need to make smart choices and focus on one task before moving on to the next. Always remember to be brave and strong, just like Zrinski!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Today, we are going to learn something really cool. Did you know that you can use something called meat tenderizer to clean stains on your clothes or other fabrics? Yes, you heard it right! But, don't worry, I'll explain everything step by step. Meat tenderizer is a magic powder used to make meat softer. Guess what? It can also help us remove those naughty stains from clothes. But always remember, you have to be careful when using it on sensitive fabrics like silk and wool. Let's learn how to use meat tenderizer to clean those stains: 1. First, make sure the meat tenderizer you are using is unseasoned. That means it doesn't have any added spices, flavors, or salt. We need just the plain white powder to work its magic. 2. Next, make a special cleaning paste. To do this, simply mix a little bit of meat tenderizer powder with some water. Stir the two together until they turn into a paste that’s not too runny. It should be thick enough to spread on the fabric. 3. Now let's treat the stain. Gently rub the paste into the fabric. Be very gentle, especially if it's the delicate fabric like silk or wool. 4. Once you've covered the whole stain with the paste, let it sit for a while. This will give some time for the meat tenderizer to work its magic and break down the stain. 5. After waiting for a bit, it's time to rinse out the paste. Gently wash the paste off the fabric using water. Make sure you remove all the paste before moving on to the next step. 6. Finally, you can wash the fabric as you normally would. This can be in the washing machine or by hand, depending on the type of fabric. And voilà! You should now have a clean fabric without any stains! So, little friends, that's how you can use meat tenderizer to clean stains on fabrics. Remember always to be gentle with delicate fabrics, and ask an adult for help if you are unsure about something.

Answer this question: where does black lightning tv show take place??","output":"The Black Lightning TV show predominantly takes place in the fictional city of Freeland, located in the United States. Created by Tony Isabella and Trevor Von Eeden, the show is based on the DC Comics character, Black Lightning, and premiered on The CW network in January 2018. Developed by Salim Akil, the series follows the life of the high school principal, Jefferson Pierce, who dons the moniker Black Lightning to save his community from various threats and criminal elements. Freeland serves as the central setting for the action, drama, and everyday life in the Black Lightning TV show. The city is portrayed as a predominantly African-American community grappling with issues such as gang violence, political corruption, and organized crime. Notably, the crime rate in Freeland had significantly escalated due to the influence of the criminal organization called The 100, led by the antagonist Tobias Whale. The city's educational institution, Garfield High School, also plays a major role in the series as an important location. Jefferson Pierce is the principal of this school, and it is his main motive to protect the students from falling into the trap of crime while making a positive impact on their lives. Jefferson had retired from his superhero career, but with the rising crime in his city and school, he returns to his role as Black Lightning, primarily to safeguard his family and community. Additionally, the show also includes some scenes set in other locations such as the secret lab of Peter Gambi, Jefferson's long-time ally, and confidant. The lab serves as a base for the Black Lightning character, where he retools his suit, plans undercover missions, strategizes the takedown of criminals, and receives information about the criminal activities happening in Freeland. In conclusion, the Black Lightning TV show primarily takes place in the fictional city of Freeland, with key locations like Garfield High School and Peter Gambi's secret lab playing crucial roles in the narrative.

Question 1: Why did the feather and hammer drop at the same rate when dropped on the moon? Question 2: Why do a hammer and a feather dropped from a certain height fall to the ground at the same time (neglecting air resistance)? Select from:  + no  + yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Yes, the answer to these two questions would be the same! Let me explain. In both questions, the reason why the feather and the hammer drop at the same rate is because of something called gravity. Gravity is a force that pulls things towards each other. On the Moon and on Earth without air resistance, both the feather and the hammer are being pulled down by gravity. So, imagine if you have a big scoop of ice cream (like Earth) and a tiny sprinkle (like the Moon). The ice cream has more gravity that pulls the feather and the hammer faster, but because of the air around us on Earth, the feather falls slower. On the Moon, there's no air, so there's nothing to slow the feather down. That's why on the Moon, both the feather and the hammer fall at the same rate. The same thing would happen on Earth if there was no air to slow the feather down. The feather and the hammer would fall at the same rate because they would only have gravity pulling them down, and there would be nothing else to slow them down. So, in both cases, the answer is the same because gravity is the main reason the feather and the hammer drop at the same rate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question 1: Are there any Forex brokers providing OMR/AED currency pairs to trade? Question 2: How do I trade CNY/INR currency pair? pick from the following. 1). no 2). yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Answering these questions in detail: **Question 1: Are there any Forex brokers providing OMR/AED currency pairs to trade?** To the best of my knowledge, trading the OMR/AED (Omani Rial/United Arab Emirates Dirham) currency pair is not widely available through most Forex brokers. This is mainly due to the fact that it is considered an exotic currency pair. Exotic pairs typically involve minor or less known currencies and may have less liquidity and higher spreads in the market, which can be less attractive to traders. However, it is not impossible to find a Forex broker that allows trading the OMR/AED pair. Some niche brokers might support trading for this pair due to specific client requests or regional focus. In this case, it would be important to perform a thorough investigation and review the credibility, reputation, and regulatory compliance of any broker you consider using before opening an account. **Question 2: How do I trade CNY/INR currency pair?** To trade the CNY/INR (Chinese Yuan Renminbi/Indian Rupee) currency pair, you will need to follow these steps: 1. Find a broker supporting the CNY/INR pair: As CNY/INR might also be considered an exotic pair, not all Forex brokers may offer it for trading. You might need to perform some research to find a broker that allows trading this currency pair. Always ensure to check the broker's credibility, reputation, fees, and regulatory compliance before opening an account. 2. Open a trading account: Once you have found a suitable broker, you will need to open a trading account with them. This usually involves providing your personal information and completing identity verification, as required by the broker. 3. Deposit funds: Fund your trading account with the required currency (typically, but not limited to, USD, EUR, or GBP). Most brokers offer various deposit methods such as bank transfer, payment via credit/debit card, or through e-wallets like Neteller, Skrill, or PayPal. Make sure you are aware of any transaction fees involved in depositing funds. 4. Choose your trading platform: Many brokers offer a choice of trading platforms, such as MetaTrader 4, MetaTrader 5, or their proprietary trading software. Choose the platform best suited to your needs, making sure it supports trading the CNY/INR pair. 5. Analyze the CNY/INR pair: Before entering any trade, it is crucial to analyze the currency pair using technical and fundamental analysis techniques. Technical analysis primarily takes the form of charting patterns and price movements, while fundamental analysis focuses on the economic and geopolitical factors that could affect currency values. 6. Place your trade: Once you have analyzed the CNY/INR pair and have determined your trading strategy, go ahead and place your trade using the appropriate order type (market, limit, or stop order) and specifying your desired position size, stop-loss, and take-profit levels. 7. Manage your trade and monitor the results: Follow the progress of your trade, and be prepared to exit the position if your analysis or risk management parameters dictate so. Track your profits or losses and learn from your trading experiences to improve your future decisions. In conclusion, the answers to your two initial questions are different. While the OMR/AED currency pair trading might not be widely available, and you would have to search for a niche broker that supports it, the process of trading the CNY/INR pair is more straightforward, although it still requires you to find an appropriate broker offering this pair."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are the following two questions the same? How do you deal with failure in research? How do I deal with failure in programming?","output":"Although both questions are about dealing with failure, they are not the same. Let's break down the differences step-by-step to explain why: Step 1: Identify the topics The first question is about failure in research, while the second question is about failure in programming. These are two distinct topics, as research is often about generating new knowledge or finding answers through scientific inquiry, while programming involves writing, testing, and debugging code. Step 2: Analyze the context The context of dealing with failure in each domain is different. In research, failure can come from various sources, such as lack of funding, inconclusive results, experimental errors, or not being able to prove a hypothesis. In programming, failure can result from logical errors, syntax errors, run-time errors, or challenges in understanding a complex problem. Step 3: Notice the subjects The first question asks, \\"How do you deal with failure in research?\\" which is directed at the person being asked (you). The second question asks, \\"How do I deal with failure in programming?\\" which is directed at the person asking the question (the user). This distinction shifts the focus from the perspective of the person responding to the perspective of the person seeking advice. Step 4: Recognize the scope The scope of potential solutions and methods for dealing with failure may vary between research and programming. For example, strategies to overcome failure in research might involve refining hypotheses, adjusting methodologies, seeking collaboration, or finding alternative funding sources. In contrast, strategies for dealing with failure in programming might emphasize better code organization, debugging techniques, code documentation, or seeking external help from programming communities. In summary, while both questions address the broader theme of dealing with failure, the topics, context, subjects, and scopes are different, making these two questions distinct from one another."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Duncan Lee Hunter (born May 31, 1948) is an American politician. He was a Republican member of the House of Representatives from California's 52nd, 45th and 42nd districts from 1981 to 2009. Hunter was the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee during the 108th and 109th Congress. Hunter sought the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States for 2008, but his campaign failed to attract significant voters or delegates in early primary and caucus states, and he dropped out after the Nevada Republican caucuses. In 1980, Hunter was recruited to run for Congress in what was then the 42nd District against 18-year incumbent Democrat Lionel Van Deerlin. Hunter was initially an underdog in a district where Democrats outnumbered Republicans by almost 2 to 1. However, his attacks on Van Deerlin's record on national defense gained traction in a district dominated by military bases and personnel. Van Deerlin did not respond quickly enough, and Hunter narrowly defeated him. He was one of many Republicans swept into office from historically Democratic districts as a result of the \\"Reagan revolution\\"; Van Deerlin had been the district's only congressman since its creation in 1963. After the 1980 census, many of the more Democratic areas were cut out of Hunter's district, and he was reelected 13 more times with no substantive opposition. His district was renumbered as the 45th District in 1983 and the 52nd in 1993.  In the 2006 general election, he defeated Navy veteran/minister John Rinaldi, a Democrat, and Michael Benoit, a Libertarian. Hunter was re-elected with 65 percent of the vote, a 33-point margin over Rinaldi.  On March 20, 2007, Hunter announced that, as part of his presidential bid, he would not seek re-election to the House of Representatives in 2008. After his son, Duncan D. Hunter, announced his candidacy for his father's seat, the younger Hunter was recalled by the United States Marine Corps to serve in the Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan. During Duncan D. Hunter's active service, his wife, Margaret Hunter, campaigned on his behalf. On June 3, 2008 Duncan D. Hunter won 72% of the Republican Primary vote and became the Republican nominee to replace his father representing the 52nd District.

They wanted to share the experience with their children: Stephanie, their teenage daughter, and Mikey, their curious young son. After careful planning, they set their hearts on visiting the magnificent Grand Canyon. The family had heard about the beauty of the Grand Canyon and they couldn't wait to explore it, take photos, and create some unforgettable memories. Upon their arrival, they were indeed captivated by the breathtaking landscape that surrounded them. They spent their days hiking, sightseeing, and reveling in the grandeur of nature. During one of their hikes, they discovered a small Kiva cavern. This piqued the interest of Mikey, who loved adventure and exploration. Inside the Kiva cavern, Mikey stumbled upon a peculiar sight: black rocks with mysterious symbols etched on them. He was fascinated by these rocks and decided to take them back home as a souvenir. His parents allowed it, thinking it would be a valuable keepsake from their once-in-a-lifetime journey. Little did the Taylors know that bringing these rocks home would change their lives forever. Upon returning from their vacation, they started to notice strange occurrences around their house. It started off subtly: flickering lights, doors opening and closing by themselves, and unexplained chills in certain rooms. The family dismissed these events as mere coincidences, attributing them to their old house's quirks. However, the incidents grew increasingly intense, leaving them feeling uneasy and frightened. One evening, as the family gathered in the living room, Bronny went upstairs to check on Mikey. She was not prepared for what she found. As she opened the door to Mikey's room, she saw a wall engulfed in flames. This was unlike any fire she had ever seen – the flames seemed to have a life of their own, dancing around the very rocks Mikey had brought back from the Kiva cavern. Terrified, Bronny screamed, and the rest of the family rushed upstairs to see what had happened. They were able to extinguish the fire, but to their astonishment, the fire-damaged part of the wall had revealed something utterly unexpected: a portal. This mysterious portal seemed to beckon the family, inviting them to explore its unknown depths. Mikey, being the adventurous boy he was, wanted to go through it to uncover its secrets. But Peter and Bronny, knowing how dangerous it could be, did their best to keep their children safe and away from the potential peril that lay beyond. Now faced with the unimaginable, the Taylors had a decision to make: uncover the truth behind these black rocks and the symbols they carried, or continue living their lives in fear and uncertainty. Through their research, they discovered that the rocks were part of an ancient, mystical tribe whose stories and history were deeply intertwined with the very land in which the Grand Canyon lay. Faced with an unraveled mystery, a newfound responsibility, and a daring adventure waiting beyond a hidden portal, the Taylors' lives were about to embark on a journey unlike anything they had ever experienced before. As they braced themselves to confront the unknown, they realized that their Grand Canyon vacation had turned out to be so much more than a picturesque retreat – it had opened the door to an unbelievable world filled with magic, lore, and unsolved mysteries longing to be uncovered."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: \\"Russia,\\" he said, \\"has been presented as well-nigh the biggest threat to Nato, or to Europe, America and other countries. \\"I am sometimes confused,\\" he went on. \\"Is this 2016 or 1962?\\" Just a few days earlier in Washington, the director of the US National Intelligence Agency, James Clapper, was giving evidence on \\"worldwide threats\\" to the influential Senate Armed Services Committee. \\"I think the Russians fundamentally are paranoid about Nato,\\" he said. \\"We could be into another Cold War-like spiral here.\\" So from both the Russians and the Americans come claims of a renewed cold war. Tensions between Russia and the West are certainly bad. The Russian annexation of Crimea initiated the chill which turned frosty over Ukraine and is now getting steadily worse due to very different perceptions as to what should be done about the human catastrophe in Syria. But in truth things were not terribly good even before the Crimea crisis. Russia opposed Nato expansion and US plans for missile defence. It argued for an entirely new European security order that went beyond institutions like Nato that were simply products of the Cold War. Of course for a time in the wake of the collapse of communism there was effectively no Russian foreign policy and not much of a military to back it up. I remember vividly visiting the Black Sea fleet's base in Sevastopol in 1991. In a showy display of sea power, Soviet warships bristling with weapons were tied up alongside the dock. But venture into the base - amazingly nobody could be bothered to stop me wandering around - and you found drums leaking chemicals, rubbish and chaos everywhere, and, as if to symbolise the Soviet collapse, a ship the size of a minesweeper simply sunk at its moorings. Now Russia is back. It is determined to defend its interests in both the near-abroad - Ukraine - and farther afield in Syria. Russia is rearming. Its Syrian intervention has become a showcase and proving ground for some of its most modern weapons systems. And its rhetoric has stepped up several notches too with, particularly alarming to the West, rather loose talk about the potential use of nuclear weapons. So it all looks a little like a new cold war, but is it really one? Nobody should underestimate the depth of the differences between Russia and the West nor the potential danger to which they may lead. But hindsight is a funny thing. Commentators and politicians alike prefer the familiar. If something can be referenced to a similar situation in the past it appears easier to understand and the policy implications seemingly suggest themselves. In hindsight, we have a rather benign and unrealistic view of what the real Cold War was about. Its edge has simply gone. Think back to Winston Churchill's famous speech at Fulton, Missouri in March 1946. In it he coined a phrase that characterised the deep division of Europe. \\"From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain,\\" he said, \\"has descended across the continent.\\" That \\"iron curtain\\" and the Soviet Union have both gone. This new \\"cold war\\"  is not a struggle of two great ideological blocs vying with each other for  global dominance. It is largely a weakened Russia seeking to stand its ground and defend its interests, as it sees them, in a hostile world. Where is the threat of world war leading to nuclear annihilation? Russia, it is said, potentially threatens the Baltic Republics. Nato has got itself in a spin over a supposedly new kind of warfare seemingly practised by the Russians - so-called hybrid war - blurring the boundaries between peace and conflict. But there are no huge Russian tank armies waiting to roll westwards towards France. There are no Warsaw Pact armies to act as Moscow's allies. And there is probably nothing in the threat that does exist that some prudent reinforcement by Nato (currently under way) cannot forestall. We forget too that the Soviet Union was ultimately beaten economically. It was a hollow force. It could not sustain the panoply of a global superpower. Well today's Russia does not even start in the superpower stakes. It is a regional player at best with an economy that is too dependent upon tumbling oil prices. Russia is in many ways a crisis waiting to happen. Indices of public health, mortality and so on are depressingly poor. It is true that Russia - through its satellite channels, its funding of curious political forces in the West and so on - seeks to create a counter-culture to the prevailing Western view. In this it has had modest success. But this is a pale shadow of the propaganda activities of Soviet days, nor are there the legions of the wrong but well-meaning supporters who saw in Soviet communism the salvation of mankind. That is not to discount current tensions. Certainly Mr Putin could over-reach. It is not impossible to imagine Nato and Russia in some peripheral sense confronting each other, say if Turkey went toe-to-toe with Moscow in Syria. But for now at least this falls short of the potential Armageddon that was, for a significant part of the Cold War, seen as an all-pervading threat. If anything this is just a throwback, a reprise of the Cold War in a minor vein. The cast is different. Many have changed sides. The context is different. The geographical scope of the rivalry is much reduced and the relative power of the players has also changed. It is simply not the Cold War of old, though, one must admit, in some ways it still seems strangely familiar.","output":"Some people are saying that there is a new cold war happening between Russia and other countries like America and Europe. This is because of tensions between them over issues like Russia taking Crimea, disagreements over Ukraine, and having different ideas about what to do in Syria. While this situation is not good, this new \\"cold war\\" is not really like the old one. The old one was a competition between two powerful groups that wanted to control the world. Russia today is weaker and is just trying to protect its own interests. While we should not ignore the disagreements that are happening, it is not the same as the old cold war, which was a very scary time with the threat of a big war and lots of weapons. The situation today is different, with different people involved and less power at stake."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The bird collects bits of sticks and grass. 3. The sticks and grasses are placed between support branches. 4. Leaves, mud, and spider webs are added to the sticks.  5. The mud, leaves, and webs glue the sticks together.  6. The solid nest supports the eggs. The perturbation mentioned is that the bird finds more leaves. As per the process described in step 4, leaves are used along with mud and spider webs to make the nest stronger. If the bird finds more leaves, it will incorporate them into the nest along with mud and spider webs. The additional leaves will result in a stronger binding, which will make the nest stick together more firmly. As for the second effect mentioned, it refers to the nest staying in place more. Since more leaves will result in a stronger binding of the sticks in the nest, the nest will be more secure and will stay in place better. So, how does the supposed perturbation (finding more leaves) influence the second effect mentioned (the nest will stay in place more)?

According to the evaluation of the results from the SAFF 2005 survey, it seems that there is still much work to be done in addressing certain issues within the workplace. A significant portion of employees, 46%, feel that senior management will make efforts to respond to the concerns that have been raised in the survey. This demonstrates that there is room for improvement in terms of how management tackles problems or issues that have been brought to their attention through feedback from employees. Moreover, only 68% of employees consider themselves able to clearly explain the organization's direction to others. This suggests that there might be a lack of clarity regarding the organization's goals, objectives, and overarching mission among its employees. In turn, this can lead to confusion and misalignment within the workplace, hindering overall efficiency, productivity, and employee satisfaction. In order to address these concerns, several steps can be taken by the organization as a whole, and by senior management in particular: 1. Open communication channels: Encourage open and transparent communication between employees and management, ensuring that relevant information is shared regularly and in an accessible manner. This can help improve employees' understanding of the organization's direction. 2. Establish clear goals and objectives: Clearly articulate the organization's vision, mission, and objectives, ensuring that all employees are aware of them. This can provide a sense of purpose and unity within the organization, as well as a common understanding of the overarching goals. 3. Regular feedback: Conduct regular surveys and feedback sessions to gauge employees' perceptions of the organization's direction, management responsiveness, and any other areas of concern. This can help identify areas of improvement and facilitate necessary changes. 4. Management training: Invest in training and development opportunities for senior management to ensure they are equipped to address employee concerns and foster a positive workplace culture. Effective management practices can significantly impact employee satisfaction and alignment with organizational goals. 5. Employee development: Encourage employees to participate in training programs and development opportunities to enhance their skills and knowledge, including understanding and communicating the organization's direction. By prioritizing and implementing these steps, the organization can not only address the concerns highlighted in the SAFF 2005 survey but can also create a more aligned and efficient workplace, resulting in increased employee satisfaction, productivity, and ultimately, success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They released their debut album, Swan Songs, on September 2, 2008, and their live CD/DVD Desperate Measures, on November 10, 2009. Their second studio album, American Tragedy, was released April 5, 2011. All of the band members use pseudonyms and wear their own unique mask, most of which are based on the common hockey goaltender design. The band originated on June 3, 2005, as The Kids from a song titled \\"Hollywood\\" (Later released as \\"The Kids\\") that Jorel Decker (J-Dog), Aron Erlichman (Deuce), and Jeff Phillips (Shady Jeff) posted on the band's MySpace profile to positive reviews, leading them to form the group Hollywood Undead with their friends George \\"Johnny 3 Tears\\" Ragan, Jordon \\"Charlie Scene\\" Terrell, Dylan \\"Funny Man\\" Alvarez, and Matthew \\"Da Kurlzz\\" Busek. In an interview with Shave magazine, J-Dog explained that when forming the band \\"Whoever was in the room at the time and played an instrument was in the band.\\" Phillips later left the group because of conflict with Erlichman.  The band only took one year working on their debut album, Swan Songs. The other two years were spent looking for a company that wouldn't try to censor the album. They first signed a record contract with MySpace Records in 2005 but they left the label after the label tried to censor their first album. They then signed a contract with A&M/Octone Records and their first album, Swan Songs was released on September 2, 2008, and reached No.22 on the Billboard 200 in its first week of release, selling 21,000 copies; which was later on released in the United Kingdom on May 18, 2009, with two bonus tracks. In April 2009, the band toured with American electronic musician Skrillex as \\"Sonny and the Blood Monkeys\\". On June 23, 2009, Hollywood Undead released Swan Songs B-Sides EP through iTunes.  The band released a CD/DVD set entitled Desperate Measures on November 10, 2009. The set includes a CD of previously unreleased six new songs, three of which are cover songs, as well a previously unreleased remix of \\"Everywhere I Go\\", and six live recordings of songs from Swan Songs, and a DVD of a full live performance by the band. In December 2009, the band won Best Crunk/Rock Rap Artist at the Rock on Request Awards. In its first week of release, Desperate Measures reached No. 29 on the Billboard 200.

Michael is dressed in elaborately jewelled and coloured armour, his left arm holding his helmet, while his right hand rests on the shoulder of the donor as he is presented to Mary. The donor kneels in prayer before the Virgin, with his hands held upwards as if in prayer, although they are not clasped. He wears a gold ring on his right small finger, and is dressed in a long olive-green houppelande, at the time the height of fashion and an indicator of status within the Burgundian court. The gown has a fur-lined high collar and deep baggy sleeves, also lined with fur.  The donor's bowl-shaped haircut, rounded at the fringe but cut above his ears, is also typical of mid-1430s Netherlandish fashion. Except for the red hood, the garment closely resembles that worn by the groom in the Arnolfini Portrait.The capital of the pillar above the donor's head is lined with carvings of military scenes.

We will add them together: -6*g - 36 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable term. To isolate the variable term (in this case, -6*g), we need to move the constant term (-36) to the other side of the equation. To do this, we'll add 36 to both sides of the equation: -6*g - 36 + 36 = 0 + 36 This simplifies to: -6*g = 36 Step 3: Solve for the variable g. Now, to solve for g, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -6: (-6*g) / -6 = 36 / -6 This simplifies to: g = -6 So, the solution to the equation -6*g - 18 - 18 = 0 is g = -6."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"To determine whether the second sentence is true if the first sentence is true, we need to analyze and compare the meaning and context of both sentences. Sentence 1: Sacre! he murmured. In this sentence, the subject, assumed to be a person, utters the exclamation \\"Sacre!\\" (an emphatic French expression used to show surprise, irritation, or admiration). The manner in which it is being communicated is through a murmur, which is a soft, low, and barely audible sound. This suggests that the person is likely speaking to themselves or expressing an inner thought, as murmuring is a more restrained and less attention-grabbing way of speaking. Sentence 2: \\"Sacre!\\" he said to himself. In the second sentence, it is clear that the person is also expressing the same exclamation \\"Sacre!\\" However, the manner in which the exclamation is being communicated here is different. Instead of murmuring, the exclamation is simply \\"said\\" to himself. While this could still be interpreted as the person speaking softly, it could also imply that the person is speaking in a regular tone or volume. The second sentence confirms that the person is explicitly talking to themselves or expressing an inner thought, unlike in the first sentence where this was only implied. Based on the comparison of these two sentences, it is possible that they could be describing the same situation, which would mean that if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence would also be true. However, we must also consider that there are differences in the manner of communication, with the first sentence involving a murmur while the second sentence not specifying the volume. In conclusion, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence can be true but not necessarily. The second sentence may not be entirely accurate due to the difference in the way \\"Sacre!\\" is expressed (murmuring versus just saying). The truthfulness of the second sentence will depend on the precise context and understanding of the situation. It is crucial to have more information about the circumstance to make a definitive statement about the truth of the second sentence when only the first sentence is confirmed to be true."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mary seems upset and frustrated because they are attending an event where Becky, a person close to them, will be singing in just five minutes. Mary is physically present at the event, but Jacob is not. Jacob is running late because he has encountered some traffic, which affects his arrival time and delays his attendance at the event. He apologizes for his tardiness and tries to justify it by mentioning the traffic. Despite his explanation, Mary appears to be uninterested in the reason behind Jacob's lateness and believes that it is Jacob's responsibility to explain the situation to Becky. The conversation suggests that Mary cares about Becky's performance and wants to make sure that everyone important, like Jacob, is there to support her. Jacob's absence seems to be causing tension between Mary and him, which makes Mary demand an explanation on behalf of their friend Becky. Mary ultimately decides to cut the conversation short, possibly because she is annoyed at Jacob or wants to focus on Becky's performance instead of their discussion.

Question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Humans and many other mammals have unusually efficient internal temperature regulating systems that automatically maintain stable core body temperatures in cold winters and warm summers. In addition, people have developed cultural patterns and technologies that help them adjust to extremes of temperature and humidity . In very cold climates, there is a constant danger of developing hypothermia , which is a life threatening drop in core body temperature to below normal levels. The normal temperature for humans is about 37.0degC. However, differences in persons and even the time of day can cause it to be as much as 6degC higher or lower in healthy individuals. It is also normal for core body temperature to be lower in elderly people. Hypothermia begins to occur when the core body temperature drops to 34.4degC. Below 29.4degC, the body cools more rapidly because its natural temperature regulating system usually fails. The rapid decline in core body temperature is likely to result in death. However, there have been rare cases in which people have been saved after their temperatures had dropped to 13.9-15.6degC. This happened in 1999 to a Swedish woman who was trapped under an ice sheet in freezing water for 80 minutes. She was found unconscious, not breathing, and her heart had stopped beating, yet she was eventually saved despite the fact that her temperature had dropped to 13.7degC. In extremely hot climates or as a result of uncontrollable infections, core body temperatures can rise to equally dangerous levels. This is hyperthermia. Life threatening hyperthermia typically starts in humans when their temperatures rise to 40.6-41.7degC. Only a few days at this extraordinarily high temperature level is likely to result in the worsening of internal organs and death. Question: People are unlikely to survive under the body temperature  _  .

Stunt pilot Cliff Secord, whose Gee Bee racer was totaled during the accident, and airplane mechanic Peevy later find the rocket pack hidden in a bi-plane cockpit. Meanwhile, well-known actor Neville Sinclair, who hired Valentine's gang to steal the rocket pack, sends his monstrous henchman Lothar to question the injured getaway driver, who tells him that the rocket pack is at the airfield. Cliff's aspiring actress girlfriend, Jenny Blake, has a bit part in the latest Neville Sinclair film. On the set, Sinclair overhears Cliff attempting to tell Jenny about the rocket pack, so he invites her to dinner. Afterward, at a local air show, Cliff uses the rocket pack (and Peevy's newly designed face-hiding finned helmet) to rescue his friend Malcolm, who is drunkenly piloting a bi-plane. Having been seen by the newsreel press in the airshow audience (and Valentine's gangsters), \\"The Rocketeer\\" becomes a media sensation.

Manny was a health conscious person, he ate organic foods and drank organic milk only. Annie liked all foods, whether they were organic or not.  But I can use this background: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary.  What is an answer for this question: Which friend drank less milk from cows treated with antibiotics? Answer:","output":"Manny, the health-conscious friend who only consumed organic foods and organic milk, drank less milk from cows treated with antibiotics. This is because organic farming practices do not allow the use of antibiotics as a preventative measure, resulting in a lower presence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens on organic farms.

Question: Given the following passage  \\"Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.  Question: How do affirmative action programs disincentivize poor white people to work harder? Answer:","output":"In the passage, Thomas Sowell, a libertarian economist, discusses the negative results of affirmative action in his book Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. According to Sowell, affirmative action programs disincentivize poor white people – who are considered part of the non-preferred groups – to work harder. This disincentive occurs because these individuals may feel that no matter how hard they work or how well they perform, they might still be overlooked in favor of individuals from preferred groups (such as certain minority populations) due to the policies in place. Consequently, poor white individuals may perceive their efforts as futile under affirmative action programs, leading them to be less motivated to strive for excellence or improve their performance. Such a perception ultimately contributes to a net loss for society as a whole, as it diminishes the overall performance and competitive nature of the workforce. Additionally, Sowell notes that affirmative action can also generate animosity towards the preferred groups, potentially exacerbating social tensions and divisions."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the bio below and try to give details on milton gonçalves 's:      - birth date     - name     - image     - birth place     - occupation     Bio: milton gonçalves -lrb- ; born in monte santo , minas gerais , brazil , on december 9 , 1933 -rrb- is a brazilian actor . he worked in many telenovelas , including \`\` a cabana do pai tomás '' , \`\` irmãos coragem '' , \`\` o bem amado '' , \`\` o espigão '' , \`\` pecado capital '' , \`\` sinal de alerta '' , \`\` o pulo do gato '' , \`\` baila comigo '' , \`\` partido alto '' , \`\` mandala '' , \`\` araponga '' and \`\` felicidade '' . he has also worked as director in \`\` escrava isaura '' and \`\` o bem amado '' . milton gonçalves is one of the most famous black actors in brazil , having collaborated twice with acclaimed director hector babenco . one notable role with babenco was that alongside william hurt and raúl juliá as a homophobic police chief in \`\` kiss of the spider woman '' . gonçalves started his career in são paulo , in an amateur group . as he moved to a professional group , he met augusto boal , who was looking for an actor to play an old black man . joining boal 's teatro de arena , milton gonçalves found an open environment for political , philosophical and artistic discussion , where he was not discriminated for his race . gonçalves wrote four plays , one of which was staged by the \`\` teatro experimental do negro '' and directed by dalmo ferreira . \`\` there i learnt everything i know about theater . it was fundamental for my comprehension of the world .

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Andrew is drinking a glass of cold water. He gets a straw and puts it in the water then gets back to work. After a while he looks over and notices water has begun to group under the bend in the straw even though the bend is above the surface of the water.  and a hint : Another important physical property of water, is adhesion . In terms of water, adhesion is the bonding of a water molecule to another substance, such as the sides of a leaf's veins. This process happens because hydrogen bonds are special in that they break and reform with great frequency. This constant rearranging of hydrogen bonds allows a percentage of all the molecules in a given sample to bond to another substance. This grip-like characteristic that water molecules form causes capillary action , the ability of a liquid to flow against gravity in a narrow space. An example of capillary action is when you place a straw into a glass of water. The water seems to climb up the straw before you even place your mouth on the straw. The water has created hydrogen bonds with the surface of the straw, causing the water to adhere to the sides of the straw. As the hydrogen bonds keep interchanging with the straw's surface, the water molecules interchange positions and some begin to ascend the straw.  Please answer this question : Will the amount of water gathered at this bend increase or decrease given enough time? Answer:","output":"Given enough time, the amount of water gathered at the bend in the straw will likely increase. This is due to the process of capillary action, which causes water to flow against gravity in narrow spaces like the straw. The water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the surface of the straw, allowing the water to adhere to the sides of the straw and ascend. As time passes, the constant rearrangement of hydrogen bonds leads to water molecules interchanging positions and continuing to rise up the straw. This process allows more water molecules to gather at the bend in the straw, as they are not only moved upwards by capillary action but also have a strong adhesive force with the straw's surface. Therefore, the amount of water gathered at the bend is likely to increase over time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The film, based on actual events, follows Coach Carter as he strives to reform the team both on and off the court, instilling discipline, accountability, and the importance of academics. Despite facing numerous obstacles, the young players progress into a force to be reckoned with, eventually earning the opportunity to compete for the state championship title. Plot: The film opens with a panoramic view of the struggling Regis High School, located in an underprivileged neighborhood plagued with poverty and gang violence. We see Coach Robert Carter, a former pro basketball player, walking up to the school for his first day as the new basketball coach. As he observes the rundown facilities and scruffy students, he knows he has his work cut out for him. Carter takes over the boys' varsity basketball team, which has been experiencing a losing streak for several years. The team is composed of talented yet undisciplined players, many on the verge of dropping out due to poor academic performance. Coach Carter quickly realizes that for these young men to succeed, they need more than just basketball skills. Thus, he begins to implement strict practice schedules and demanding academic standards.

Coach Carter pushes them to see value in their education, emphasizing that it will open more doors for them in the future. The story delves into the lives of various players, portraying their struggles with broken homes, peer pressure, and dangerous affiliations. Through perseverance, Coach Carter gradually earns the respect of the players and their families. Even some of the more problematic players turn their lives around, with several obtaining scholarships to prestigious colleges.

However, the coach's relentless drive and passion for the sport soon pay off, as the team starts winning games, improving its ranking in the district. Throughout the season, the team continues to improve, eventually succeeding in defeating previous state championship titleholders.

John liked the areas in his old town a lot better than the locations in his new town, because the","output":"former held a lot of sentimental value and provided a sense of comfort and familiarity, whereas the latter seemed more alien and impersonal, making it difficult for him to feel at ease and fully embrace his new surroundings. Growing up in his old town, John had formed countless memories and connections that made the various areas in the town feel like an essential part of his life. The local park where he would spend hours playing with his childhood friends, the quaint little café that served the best hot chocolate in town, and the community center where he took his first guitar lessons – all these places shaped his formative years and defined his identity. Consequently, the nostalgic attachment he had to these locations made it seem as though they were a part of him, and whenever he visited those familiar spots, a wave of warmth and homeliness would wash over him, filling his heart with a sense of belonging. Contrastingly, John struggled to forge similar bonds with the locations in his new town, as he was yet to create meaningful experiences or form lasting friendships there. Although the new town boasted of advanced infrastructure and modern architecture, the glossy sheen of the new shopping mall or the state-of-the-art sports complex did little to evoke the same emotional response that the humble establishments in his old town did. As he ventured out to explore the unfamiliar alleys and attractions in the hopes of finding a sense of camaraderie and connection, he couldn't help but feel isolated and disconnected from this environment that seemed so foreign to him. Apart from the lack of emotional attachment, John also grappled with the practical challenges of adapting to a new location. Navigating the new town's streets became a daily ordeal, as he didn't have the luxury of his muscle memory guiding him through the maze of turns and landmarks that he was so accustomed to in his old town. Furthermore, trying to establish a new network of personal and professional relationships proved to be a daunting task, as the residents of the new town seemed distant and less approachable compared to the warm and friendly community he grew up with. In conclusion, John's fondness for the areas in his old town stems from the deep-rooted sentimental value, and the emotional connection formed through years of shared experiences and memories that made the town feel like an extension of himself. Despite the potential benefits and opportunities presented by his new town, the unfamiliarity and absence of a sense of belonging made it difficult for John to appreciate the locations in his new town as much as he treasured the ones in his old town. It would likely take time, persistence, and a willingness to create new memories and connections for John to eventually grow as fond of his new home as he once was of his old one."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The fine was handed to the globe-trotting 71-year-old after a blizzard dumped two feet of snow on his city this week. US Secretary of State John Kerry has been fined for failing to shovel snow outside his home after a major winter storm hit America's north east. City officials hit the one-time candidate for president with a 50 penalty for not clearing the sidewalk outside his mansion in Louisburg Square, Boston (pictured) Boston Mayor Martin Walsh had vowed to crack down on anyone who left the sidewalks in front of their homes and businesses buried in snow. Officials tagged Kerry with a 50 fine at 9:45am on Thursday for failing to clear up on the Pinckney Street side of his home, it has been reported. Kerry was in Saudi Arabia earlier this week attending the funeral of King Abdullah with President Obama. It was one of 210 snow-removal citations issued on Thursday, the Boston Herald reported. The newspaper said another resident reported the un-shovelled snow to the Inspectional Services Department and that the official who dealt with the case 'did not know' that it was Kerry's mansion. Kerry's spokesman Glen Johnson told the Boston Globe that Kerry will promptly pay the fine. He said shovelers finished clearing the sidewalk late Thursday morning. Clean-up: In Massachusetts a man uses a snow blower in a bid to clear the roads in the aftermath of Juno.

In Sentence 1, the main components are \\"my own body\\" and \\"my real body.\\"  In Sentence 2, the main component is \\"a body of my own.\\" Step 2: Analyze the meaning of the components.  \\"My own body\\" means a body that belongs to me.  \\"My real body\\" means a body that genuinely belongs to me and is not fake or imaginary.  \\"A body of my own\\" means a body that belongs to me. Step 3: Compare the meanings to find a relationship. Sentence 1 conveys that the person is talking about their real body, which genuinely belongs to them and is not an imitation. Sentence 1 emphasizes that the body is both \\"own\\" and \\"real.\\" Sentence 2 expresses ownership of a body without explicitly specifying the \\"real\\" aspect. However, it can be inferred that the person's \\"own\\" body is their genuine body unless otherwise stated. Step 4: Determine if the relationship represents entailment.

But as we respect someone's rights, and as we profess tolerance, we shouldn't change -- or have to change -- our basic views on the sanctity of marriage. I believe in the sanctity of marriage. I think it's very important that we protect marriage as an institution, between a man and a woman. Can we infer the following? The sanctity of marriage also includes common-law unions.","output":"To infer whether the sanctity of marriage includes common-law unions, we need to first examine the key components of both the given statement and the concept of common-law unions, and then assess the compatibility between the two. Based on the given statement, it is evident that the speaker strongly believes in the sanctity of marriage and emphasizes the importance of protecting the institution of marriage between a man and a woman. Sanctity, in this context, refers to the sacredness, holiness, or inviolability of the marital relationship. Common-law unions, on the other hand, are arrangements where two people cohabit and live together in a long-term relationship without obtaining a formal legal marriage. Generally, common-law partners have many of the same legal rights and responsibilities as married couples, although the specifics may vary depending on the jurisdiction. Common-law relationships are an alternative to the traditional institution of marriage. So, can we infer that the sanctity of marriage includes common-law unions as well? It depends on the perspective.  From the speaker's point of view, the sanctity of marriage seems to be preserved in the institution of marriage itself, which only includes unions between a man and a woman. As they appreciate the significance and sacredness of the bond between married couples, they may not consider common-law unions on the same footing due to the lack of formal recognition, thus potentially excluding them from the sanctity of marriage according to their beliefs. From a broader perspective, the sanctity of marriage may still be attributed to common-law unions if one is willing to consider the essence of the bond between the two partners rather than the formal structure. The sacredness of a relationship might be more about the love, commitment, and emotional connection that the couple shares, regardless of whether their union has been legally formalized. In this case, the emotional bond and connection between common-law partners are just as strong as those between married couples, and can still uphold the sanctity traditionally associated with marriage. Ultimately, whether or not the sanctity of marriage extends to common-law unions is subjective and depends on the individual's perspective and cultural, religious, or philosophical views.

They travel to planets inserting themselves into a host body of that planet's dominant species while suppressing the host's consciousness. They access the host's memories, and occupied hosts are identifiable by silver rings in the hosts' eyes. A human on the run, Melanie Stryder, is captured and infused with a soul called \\"Wanderer.\\" Wanderer is asked by Seeker to access Melanie's memories in order to discover the location of a pocket of unassimilated humans. Melanie's consciousness, however, has not been completely eliminated, and it struggles to regain control of her body. Melanie and Wanderer carry out an internal conversation and debate with each other, forming a friendship. Wanderer shares with Seeker that Melanie was traveling with her brother, Jamie, and her boyfriend, Jared Howe, to find Melanie's uncle Jeb in the desert. Wanderer admits that Melanie is still present, so Seeker decides to be transferred into Melanie's body to get the information herself. With the help of Melanie, Wanderer escapes and makes her way to the desert, where she is found by Jeb, who takes her to a series of caves hidden inside a mountain where the humans (including Jared and Jamie) are hiding. Wanderer's presence is met with hostility by all but Jeb and Jamie. Melanie instructs Wanderer not to tell anyone she is still alive, since it would provoke them, though she later allows her to tell Jamie. Wanderer begins interacting with the humans and slowly begins to gain their trust, forming a bond with Ian O'Shea. Seeker leads a search party into the desert to find Wanderer. They intercept one of the shelter's supply teams, and in the ensuing chase, Aaron and Brandt commit suicide to avoid capture. During the chase, Seeker accidentally kills another Soul, leading her superiors to call off the search. Returning to the caves, Jared and Kyle move to kill Wanderer, causing Jamie to reveal that Melanie's consciousness is alive. Jeb and Ian accept this, but...

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: How do I sell a car to the government? Selling a car to the government could be a good option, as they're often in need of various types of vehicles for different purposes. Here's a detailed approach to selling a vehicle to the government: 1. Identify the appropriate government agency: Research which agency or department of the government would be most interested in purchasing your car. This could include local government entities, such as county or city departments, as well as state or federal agencies. 2. Register as a government contractor: To sell your car to the government, you'll need to register as a contractor. This process varies depending on the country you live in. In the United States, register your business with the System for Award Management (SAM) at sam.gov. 3. Find bidding opportunities: There are multiple platforms where governments post their requirements for goods and services. In the United States, you can search on websites like beta.SAM.gov or fbo.gov (Federal Business Opportunities) depending on the level of government you are targeting. Look out for vehicle procurement requests and make note of relevant opportunities. 4. Prepare your bid proposal: Carefully read the specifications and requirements outlined in the procurement request. Outline the details of your vehicle, including its make, model, year, mileage, features, and how it meets the needs specified by the agency soliciting bids. 5. Submit your bid: Complete and submit the bid proposal by the deadline indicated in the procurement request, including any additional documentation requested such as proof of ownership, maintenance records, or warranties. 6. Await the results: Once your bid has been submitted, wait for the contracting agency to evaluate all bids and make a decision. If your bid is successful, you will be contacted by the agency to arrange the transfer of the vehicle and payment. Note that government procurement processes can be time-consuming and competitive, so patience and persistence are essential. This process may not be the fastest way to sell a car, but it can open doors to new business opportunities and potential contracts. Second question: What is the fastest way to sell a car? The fastest way to sell a car differs from selling a car to the government, as it often involves targeting individual buyers or private entities. Here are some tips for quickly selling a car: 1. Price your car correctly: Research your car's market value based on its age, make, model, and overall condition. Price your car competitively to attract potential buyers. 2. Advertise through multiple channels: Utilize online platforms such as Craigslist, AutoTrader, eBay Motors, or social media groups. Place ads in local newspapers and post flyers at community bulletin boards. 3. Take high-quality photos: Capture clear and well-lit pictures of your car's exterior and interior from various angles. This visual presentation can significantly impact buyer interest. 4. Be honest and transparent: Highlight your car's selling points, but don't shy away from disclosing any issues or problems. Being upfront with potential buyers fosters trust and expedites the selling process. 5. Prepare your car for sale: Make sure your car is clean, looks good, and is in good working order. Address any minor repairs or maintenance issues to maximize its selling potential. 6. Offer flexible payment options: Be open to accepting multiple payment methods, such as cash, cashier's check, or money order. Offering flexibility can help close a deal faster. 7. Be available and responsive: Respond promptly to inquiries from potential buyers and be available for appointments to view or test-drive the vehicle. In conclusion, selling a car to the government and finding the fastest way to sell a car are not the same thing. The first option requires engaging with government procurement processes, while the second focuses on targeting individual buyers or private entities for a quick sale. Both approaches have their own benefits and challenges, and the choice between them depends on your specific goals and circumstances."},{"instruction":"Information:  - The Holy Land (Hebrew: , ; Arabic: ) is an area roughly located between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea that also includes the Eastern Bank of the Jordan River.

Hyderabad: After India gained independence, the Nizam declared his intention to remain independent rather than become part of the Indian Union. The Hyderabad State Congress, with the support of the Indian National Congress and the Communist Party of India, began agitating against Nizam VII in 1948. On 17 September that year, the Indian Army took control of Hyderabad State after an invasion codenamed Operation Polo. With the defeat of his forces, Nizam VII capitulated to the Indian Union by signing an Instrument of Accession, which made him the Rajpramukh (Princely Governor) of the state until 31 October 1956. Between 1946 and 1951, the Communist Party of India fomented the Telangana uprising against the feudal lords of the Telangana region. The Constitution of India, which became effective on 26 January 1950, made Hyderabad State one of the part B states of India, with Hyderabad city continuing to be the capital. In his 1955 report Thoughts on Linguistic States, B. R. Ambedkar, then chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution, proposed designating the city of Hyderabad as the second capital of India because of its amenities and strategic central location.

I like these a lot- good response throughout the range with strong bass from the sub (which can thankfully be dialed way down when needed). Could have a stronger mid, but they are not intended to be studio monitors, so it has easily surpassed my expectations. I listen to rock, drum and bass, jazz and house on them.I actually purchased the Soundsticks II but they arrived DOA. Very happy with these as a replacement. Soundsticks are a little fancy for their own good with the design. I didnt even like the design in person, the perrywinkle styrofoam bases were way ugly.Con- why make the base of the desk speaker 6\\" long when 3\\" would keep it upright, especially if you made it a bit wider?

Cynthia was having serious regrets about a break-up and asked Christine for support because","output":"she felt an overwhelming sense of loneliness and despair, unsure if she had made the right decision in ending things with her former partner. Christine, who had always been Cynthia's confidant and emotional rock, warmly welcomed her friend into her home, offering her a cup of hot tea and a safe space to unload her pent-up feelings. As they settled comfortably into the cozy living room, Cynthia recounted the story of her tumultuous relationship with her ex-partner. She spoke of both the highlights and the low moments they shared, emphasizing the love and passion they once had for each other, which made the break-up all the more painful. Tears welled up in her eyes as she explained how the constant disagreements and the feeling of being emotionally drained finally led her to make the hard decision to end their relationship. Christine listened attentively, her heart aching for her friend's pain. She knew all too well the emotional turmoil that comes with the end of a significant relationship, remembering her own heartbreak just a few years prior. When Cynthia finally finished pouring her heart out, Christine knew it was essential to offer honest, supportive advice to help her navigate through this difficult time. Drawing from her own experiences and wisdom, Christine reminded Cynthia that healing from a break-up is not a linear process, and it is entirely normal to feel regret and self-doubt. She emphasized the importance of giving herself time and space to process her emotions and the reasons behind her decision, ensuring her that the guilt and sadness she felt are merely temporary aspects of the healing journey. Furthermore, Christine encouraged Cynthia to surround herself with loving and supportive friends and family members, as having a strong support network goes a long way in helping one heal after a break-up. She also advised Cynthia to engage in self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, and journaling, to help her deal with her emotions in a healthy and productive manner. Lastly, Christine emphasized the importance of self-compassion and urged Cynthia not to blame herself for the break-up. Instead, she should recognize that relationships are a two-way street, and both parties contribute to its successes and failures. By doing so, Cynthia could eventually come to terms with the fact that, despite the pain it ultimately caused, the break-up may have been the best decision for both her and her ex-partner's well-being and future happiness. As the conversation came to an end, Cynthia felt a sense of relief and gratitude for having Christine as a friend. Despite the lingering pain from her break-up, she felt stronger and more equipped to handle the challenges and emotions that lay ahead. And as they continued to sip their tea and reminisce on the good times, it was clear that, together, they could endure any obstacle that life had to offer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The IT worker pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and whilst uninsured when he appeared at Birmingham Crown Court in August. Saqib Hussain, 25, was speeding in the hired Audi R8 Spyder in a 30mph zone when he crashed into a Ford Fiesta carrying two sisters at 11.30pm on August 26 last year. The car can be seen (left) just moments before the crash. The court was shown CCTV footage of the moment the hit the bright blue Ford at over two-and-a-half times the speed limit. The court heard Hussain crashed his Audi R8 into a Ford Fiesta carrying Noreen Ryan, Birmingham. Hussain, from Birmingham, was handed a six year prison sentence at the same court. Jailing him Judge Peter Carr said: 'You showed flagrant disregard for the rules of the road and were a danger to everybody on them. 'You have since said it was your fantasy to drive the car and that you were testing its capabilities, but it seems to me you were showing off. 'The words from the family do not even come close to adequately describing the pain and grief that they feel for the loss of Noreen.' Emergency services were forced to cut off the roof of the super-mini to free it’s trapped occupants. Investigators found Hussain had been driving at at last 76mph when he spotted the oncoming car and began to brake. Noreen Ryan, 49, who was a front seat passenger, was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival. Her sister, driver Mary Ryan, 60, suffered a punctured lung, broken pelvis, broken ribs and a chipped spine in the crash in Hall Green, Birmingham. Hussain initially fled the scene but was arrested when he handed himself in at a police station later the same night. Investigators found Hussain had been driving at at last 76mph when he spotted the oncoming car and began to brake. The court heard Hussain had picked up the keys of the car of the hired car from a table at a family wedding and had 'fantasised' about driving such a powerful car. Prosecutor Joanne Barker told the court: 'Mary Ryan was not at fault in any way for what happened that night. 'Had he [Hussain] been travelling at the speed limit the collision would not have occurred. 'It is not the prosecution case he was racing with the Mercedes vehicle behind. 'The prosecution would submit he may well have been showing off. 'He did not adjust his speed despite seeing her. He was going too fast to do anything about it.' After the crash Hussain climbed out of the wreckage and said to an injured Mary: 'I’m sorry it’s not your fault, it’s mine.' Hussain and passenger Faizal Wahid, who suffered a broken cheekbone, jaw and eye socket and is now paralysed down the left side of his face, both fled the scene. Emergency services were forced to cut off the roof of the super-mini to free it's trapped occupants. Pictures taken at the time show the mangled wreckage of the blue Fiesta barely recognisable after the devastating impact of the horror smash. Robert Cowley, defending, said Hussain had shown genuine remorse for what he had done. Before the crash he said he would have been described as a 'decent, hardworking, polite and respectable individual.' A family tribute to Noreen, the youngest of her seven brothers and sisters, described her as the 'heart, spark and soul' of her family. It said: 'Birmingham City was Noreen’s passion in life and she was a season ticket holder who never missed a match. 'But her family was also very important to her and she was a much-loved stepmother, step grandmother, daughter, sister and aunty to her nieces and nephews. 'Noreen was the heart, spark and soul of her family. She was overgenerous and loved buying presents at Christmas and birthdays. 'She enjoyed a glass of prosecco with the girls and had a great sense of humour and some fantastic one-liners. 'She had watched all of Birmingham City’s home matches with her brother John since they were kids. She always had the last word on football debates.'

Mary Ryan was driving and her sister Noreen Ryan was with her. Mary got hurt very badly, and Noreen sadly passed away because of the accident. This all happened last year on August 26 at night.

Q:Given the following context:  Joseph Krauzenberg is a very wealthy Hungarian Jewish industrial tycoon whose fortune is mirrored in the great palaces he owns. However, by 1944 his important businesses are needed by the Nazis and Hitler's 'Final Solution' is sweeping through Europe. The Nazis are greedy to accumulate wealth as easily as possible, and under the terms of the Third Reich's \\"Europa Plan\\", Krauzenberg arranges with Nazi leaders to exchange his fortune, his business holdings (textile plants, steel mills, ownership of several banks) and a collection of rare art for safe passage to Switzerland for himself, his wife Rachel, and their family. As the night of transaction approaches, Krauzenberg visits his large family being held by the Gestapo, and reassures them that all will be safe. Such is Krauzenberg's wealth and power that when he agrees to sign over his property, it is two of the most powerful men in the Nazi regime who announce they will be coming to his house to handle the paperwork – Adolf Eichmann and Heinrich Himmler. However, as the Nazi leaders are ushered into Krauzenberg's home, they are struck by something unusual – his two most trusted servants, Hans Vassmann and his wife Ingrid are a married Aryan couple who, despite the law, are still working for Jews. As it happens, Eichmann and Himmler's suspicions are well-founded – despite appearing to be the perfect Aryan couple, Hans and Ingrid are actually Jews working deep undercover with the underground Resistance. Young, married, in love and expecting their first child, they work as valet and maid for the elderly Jewish couple.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.  Now, I have a new situation: Mike lives in a cold mid-western city, where there is not much predator prey interaction. Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat. He also knew that darker coats are more suitable in cold environment with less predator prey interaction. He started thinking why the squirrels developed different coat colors.  Answer this question please: Would darker squirrels have greater or smaller chance of survival than lighter squirrels? A:","output":"In the given situation where Mike lives in a cold mid-western city with less predator-prey interaction, darker coated squirrels would have a greater chance of survival than lighter squirrels.  Here's the step-by-step justification: 1. The environment is cold, and darker coats are more suitable in cold environments due to their better heat absorption capabilities. Darker colors absorb more heat from sunlight, which helps the squirrels stay warm in the cold environment. 2. There is not much predator-prey interaction in the city, so the primary factor impacting squirrel survival is related to the cold climate and not to camouflage for protection against predators. If predator-prey interaction were a significant factor, the coat color that provided better camouflage might be the more advantageous trait. 3. Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment, like the darker coat in this case, will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. 4. As a result of these factors, the population of darker coated squirrels would be more likely to grow over time, as they are better suited to the cold environment.

A self-made multi-millionaire, his net worth is over 43 million due to his success as the founder of Playboy magazine. Hefner is also a political activist and philanthropist active in several causes and public issues. He is a World War II veteran.  - Air Education and Training Command (AETC) was established 1 July 1993, with the realignment of the former Air Training Command and the extant Air University. It is one of the U.S. Air Force's ten major commands (MAJCOMs) and reports to Headquarters, United States Air Force.  - The National Security Act of 1947 was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following World War II. The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense.  - Nuevo León, or New Leon, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Nuevo León, is one of the 31 states which, with Mexico City, compose the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided into 51 municipalities and its capital city is Monterrey.  - The centerfold or centrefold of a magazine refers to a gatefolded spread, usually a portrait such as a pin-up or a nude, inserted in the middle of the publication, or to the model featured in the portrait. In saddle-stitched magazines (as opposed to those that are perfect-bound), the centerfold does not have any blank space cutting through the image.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Playboy Enterprises, Inc. is an American privately held global media and lifestyle company headquartered in Beverly Hills, California. It was founded by Hugh Marston Hefner to initially manage the \\"Playboy\\" magazine empire.

As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775.  - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - Lackland Air Force Base is a United States Air Force base located in Bexar County, Texas.

Aerial warfare includes bombers attacking enemy concentrations or strategic targets; fighter aircraft battling for control of airspace; attack aircraft engaging in close air support against ground targets; naval aviation flying against sea and nearby land targets; gliders, helicopters and other aircraft to carry airborne forces such as paratroopers; aerial refueling tankers to extend operation time or range; and military transport aircraft to move cargo and personnel. Historically, military aircraft have included lighter-than-air balloons carrying artillery observers; lighter-than-air airships for bombing cities; various sorts of reconnaissance, surveillance and early warning aircraft carrying observers, cameras and radar equipment; torpedo bombers to attack enemy shipping; and military air-sea rescue aircraft for saving downed airmen. Modern aerial warfare includes missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Surface forces are likely to respond to enemy air activity with anti-aircraft warfare.  - Texas is the second largest state in the United States by both area and population.

When the universe was young, there was only gas and dust. From this gas and dust, everything we now see was made. How were stars and planets created from just gas and dust? The answer is gravity. The same gravity that holds you down on Earth. The same force that causes your pencil to roll off your desk. The same force that causes it to fall to the floor. The invisible force of gravity caused dust and gas particles to be pulled together. This force is what formed all the objects in our solar system. This force formed the smallest moons. It also formed our Sun. This force caused more than just our solar system to form. It caused all the other solar systems to form. It caused the formation of all the galaxies of the universe.  After reading the above, is \\"Centrifugal force\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What force formed all of the objects in the solar system?\\"? OPTIONS: a). no. b). yes.","output":"a). no.

Question: Given the following context:  Presley's rise to national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture. As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude. With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture. In this regard, Little Richard said of Presley, \\"He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music.\\" Al Green agreed: \\"He broke the ice for all of us.\\" President Jimmy Carter remarked on his legacy in 1977: \\"His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture. His following was immense, and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of his country.\\" Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: at the age of 21, within a year of his first appearance on American network television, he was one of the most famous people in the world.Presley's name, image, and voice are instantly recognizable around the globe. He has inspired a legion of impersonators. In polls and surveys, he is recognized as one of the most important popular music artists and influential Americans. \\"Elvis Presley is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century\\", said composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein. \\"He introduced the beat to everything and he changed everything—music, language, clothes.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (March 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) At Chicago O'Hare International Airport, a group of Marines have just returned to the US from Iraq. As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis (Manny PÃ©rez), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Alexis, and Alexis stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Alexis, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back then they make their way to Edy's store. Jesse's sister Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito) arrives by taxi, although everyone assumes she came in a limo because they all assume that she made it big in Hollywood as an actress. Jesse's Brother Mauricio (John Leguizamo) also arrives,... My question: Why was Edy getting calls from his doctor?","output":"The plot provided in your question does not specify any information about Edy, a character in the movie \\"Nothing Like the Holidays\\", receiving calls from his doctor. We know from the plot summary that Edy Rodriguez, portrayed by Alfred Molina, is the father of Jesse Rodriguez. He is seen preparing a welcome home sign for his son, Jesse, who is returning home from service in Iraq. Later, he proceeds to his store, a local neighborhood supermarket, known as Bodega. There he appears to be popular among the ladies. However, there is no mention in this particular plot summary about Edy receiving calls from his doctor, nor is there any implication or clue given regarding such an event. If there were a subplot in the film where Edy was dealing with a health issue that required him to receive calls from his doctor, it is not mentioned or alluded to in the presented summary. It could be that this is a detail in another part of the film that wasn't included in the plot summary. To best answer your question, one would need more information or context.

I first rented this film many years ago, and was completely enthralled by it. Just recently, feeling a strange need to revisit some of the way-too-few films that I've immensely enjoyed in my lifetime, I decided to give \\"Erendira\\" another look. And I'm glad I did, as I soon discovered that even the passage of time has not in the least dulled the shine of this film. The story is about a teenaged girl (Erendira, played remarkably by Claudia O'hana - in some respects she resembles Winona Ryder!) who accidentally burns down her grandmother's mansion after which the grandmother, played downright hypnotically by Irene Papas, forces the girl into a life of prostitution on the road to repay the damages.  The viewing is at once fascinating and compelling - though, inspite of the basic premise, which deals with prostitution, is tastefully void of gratuitous steamy sexual content. The story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother, and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact on their sojourn - which, by the way, is in the rough and tumble part of rural Mexico. The film is very atmospheric, arrestingly enigmatic with a decided dreamlike quality. It sometimes borders on the bizarre, but not to the point of, say, a David Lynch film. It's also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature, read the comments from previous viewers below... Often in the background you hear the sounds of a lone accordion, quiet and melancholy, adding just the right musical accents to highlight the Mexican setting. The cinematography of the rural places, many of which are in the desert, is quite superb. The film moves at a nice pace, neither too fast nor too slow, and after every scene I felt I had to rewind the tape and play it over again, just because it makes you want to do that. For me anyway, it really is that compelling. Hopefully you will see the film in its Spanish language version, with subtitles. I studied Spanish in high school as well as in college, and I was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue. Por ejemplo: \\"El mundo no es tan grande como pensaba.\\" (\\"The world's not as big as I thought\\" - i.e., It's a small world.) This film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine, which, upon drinking, is immensely satisfying, however, you are left with some sadness upon realizing that there aren't more bottles just like this one.

Information:  - Lancy is a municipality of the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland.  - The Republic and Canton of Geneva (; ) is the French-speaking westernmost canton or state of Switzerland, surrounded on almost all sides by France. As is the case in several other Swiss cantons (e.g. Ticino, Neuchâtel, and Jura), this canton is referred to as a republic within the Swiss Confederation.  - A photographer (the Greek  (\\"phos\\"), meaning \\"light\\", and  (\\"graphê\\"), meaning \\"drawing, writing\\", together meaning \\"drawing with light\\") is a person who makes photographs.  - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.  The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.  - Eastern Christianity consists of four main church families: the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, and the Assyrian Church of the East, as well as the Eastern Catholic Churches (that are in communion with Rome but still maintain an Eastern liturgy). The term is used in contrast with Western Christianity (namely the Latin Church and Protestanism). Eastern Christianity consists of the Christian traditions and churches that developed in the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia Minor, the Balkans, Southern India and parts of the Far East over several centuries. The term does not describe a single communion or religious denomination. Some Eastern churches have more in common historically and theologically with Western Christianity than with one another. The various Eastern churches do not normally refer to themselves as \\"Eastern\\", with the exception of the Assyrian Church of the East and its offshoots.  - An angel, especially according to Abrahamic religions and Zoroastrianism, is a spiritual being superior to humans in power and intelligence. Angels are typically described as benevolent, dreadful, and endowed with wisdom and knowledge of earthly events, but not infallible; for they strive with each other, and God has to make peace between them. Most of them serve either as intermediaries between Heaven and Earth, or as guardian spirits. They are studied in the theological doctrine of angelology. In Christian Science, the word \\"angel\\" is used to refer to an inspiration from God. The use of the term has extended to refer to artistic depictions of the spirits, and it is also used figuratively to refer to messengers and harbingers, and to people who possess high qualities of goodness, purity, selflessness, intelligence, and/or beauty.  - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  - An icon (from Greek \\"eikn\\" \\"image\\") is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from Eastern Christianity and certain Eastern Catholic churches. The most common subjects include Christ, Mary, saints and/or angels. Though especially associated with \\"portrait\\" style images concentrating on one or two main figures, the term also covers most religious images in a variety of artistic media produced by Eastern Christianity, including narrative scenes.  - A photograph or photo is an image created by light falling on a light-sensitive surface, usually photographic film or an electronic medium such as a CCD or a CMOS chip. Most photographs are created using a camera, which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see. The process and practice of creating photographs is called photography. The word \\"photograph\\" was coined in 1839 by Sir John Herschel and is based on the Greek  (\\"phos\\"), meaning \\"light\\", and  (\\"graphê\\"), meaning \\"drawing, writing\\", together meaning \\"drawing with light\\".  - Nicolas Bouvier ( March 6 , 1929 , Lancy -- February 17 , 1998 ) was a 20th - century Swiss traveller , writer , icon painter and photographer .

(CNN) -- Eight people in China have been indicted for their roles in an attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Saturday, citing local authorities. Authorities in the restive Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in western China accused the suspects of organizing, leading and participating as a terrorist group and endangering public security. The people were indicted Friday. The eight are to stand trial in Urumqi, the capital of the region, where Chinese authorities have cracked down on violence involving Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group. The Tiananmen incident occurred October 28, when a vehicle drove through security barriers into a crowd in the square. It crashed into a pedestrian bridge in front of the Forbidden City and burst into flames. The attack killed five people, including three in the vehicle, and wounded 40 others. In response, police in Xinjiang launched a crackdown on extremist groups, arresting 200 suspects and seizing hundreds of explosive devices,","output":"knives, and other weapons. The authorities have sought to establish stronger security measures and communication mechanisms across the region to prevent such attacks in the future. The investigation concluded that the suspects were heavily influenced by extremist ideologies and orchestrated the attack as a deliberate act of terrorism against the government and innocent civilians. Law enforcement agencies have since intensified their efforts to track down the masterminds behind the attack and dismantle local and international networks involved in fostering terrorism within the region. Facing widespread public outrage and condemnation from the international community, the Chinese government has vowed to take effective measures to ensure that such incidents are not repeated. This includes strengthening efforts to spread the message of peace and unity, investing in programs aimed at socio-economic development of the Uyghur communities, and creating opportunities for dialogue between different ethnic and religious groups to foster understanding and trust. As part of these initiatives, the Chinese government has also pledged to increase vigilance and cooperation with neighboring countries and international organizations to contain the spread of extremism and terrorism in the region. By sharing intelligence and resources, governments and security agencies can enhance their capability to combat these threats and protect citizens from violent attacks. The trial of the eight suspects in Urumqi is set to commence shortly, and the proceedings will surely be closely monitored by the international community. The outcome of this trial may serve as a reminder of the severity of the challenge posed by terrorism, and the need for sustained efforts by governments and societies to address the root causes of such violence. In conclusion, the Chinese authorities must continue to strive for a comprehensive and enduring solution to the unrest in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. By promoting social cohesion, economic development, and interfaith dialogue among the diverse communities in the region, they can hope to forge a more harmonious and peaceful society, where acts of terror, like the tragic attack on Tiananmen Square in October, are a thing of the past. It is only through united efforts by governments, local communities, and the international community that the threat of terrorism can be effectively countered and the safety and well-being of all citizens be guaranteed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Yelberton Abraham Tittle Jr. (October 24, 1926 - October 8, 2017), better known as Y. A. Tittle, was a professional American football quarterback. He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, New York Giants, and Baltimore Colts, after spending two seasons with the Colts in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Known for his competitiveness, leadership, and striking profile, Tittle was the centerpiece of several prolific offenses throughout his seventeen-year professional career from 1948 to 1964. Tittle played college football for Louisiana State University, where he was a two-time All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) quarterback for the LSU Tigers football team. Born and raised in Marshall, Texas, to Alma and Yelberton Abraham Tittle Sr., Yelberton Abraham Tittle Jr. aspired to be a quarterback from a young age. He spent hours in his backyard throwing a football through a tire swing, emulating his neighbor and boyhood idol, Sammy Baugh. Tittle played high school football at Marshall High School. In his senior year the team posted an undefeated record and reached the state finals.  After a recruiting battle between Louisiana State University and the University of Texas, Tittle chose to attend LSU in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and play for the LSU Tigers. He was part of a successful 1944 recruiting class under head coach Bernie Moore that included halfbacks Jim Cason, Dan Sandifer, and Ray Coates. Freshmen were eligible to play on the varsity during World War II, so Tittle saw playing time immediately. He later said the finest moment of his four years at LSU was beating Tulane as a freshman, a game in which he set a school record with 238 passing yards. It was one of two games the Tigers won that season.  Moore started Tittle at tailback in the single-wing formation his first year, but moved him to quarterback in the T formation during his sophomore season. As a junior in 1946, Tittle's three touchdown passes in a 41-27 rout of rival Tulane helped ensure LSU a spot in the Cotton Bowl Classic. Known notoriously as the \\"Ice Bowl\\", the 1947 Cotton Bowl pitted LSU against the Arkansas Razorbacks in sub-freezing temperatures on an ice-covered field in Dallas, Texas. LSU moved the ball much better than the Razorbacks, but neither team was able to score, and the game ended in a 0-0 tie. Tittle and Arkansas end Alton Baldwin shared the game's MVP award. Following the season, United Press International (UPI) placed Tittle on its All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) first-team.  UPI again named Tittle its first-team All-SEC quarterback in 1947. In Tittle's day of iron man football, he played on both offense and defense. While on defense during a 20-18 loss to SEC champion Ole Miss in his senior season, Tittle's belt buckle was torn off as he intercepted a pass from Charlie Conerly and broke a tackle. He ran down the sideline with one arm cradling the ball and the other holding up his pants. At the Ole Miss 20-yard line, as he attempted to stiff-arm a defender, Tittle's pants fell and he tripped and fell onto his face. The fall kept him from scoring the game-winning touchdown.  In total, during his college career Tittle set school passing records with 162 completions out of 330 attempts for 2,525 yards and 23 touchdowns. He scored seven touchdowns himself as a runner. His passing totals remained unbroken until Bert Jones surpassed them in the 1970s. Entity:","output":"Y. A. Tittle"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: LISBON, Portugal – President Barack Obama won NATO summit agreement Friday to build a missile shield over Europe, an ambitious commitment to protect against Iranian attack while demonstrating the alliance's continuing relevance — but at the risk of further aggravating Russia. On another major issue, Obama and the allies are expected to announce plans on Saturday to begin handing off security responsibility in Afghanistan to local forces next year and to complete the transition by the end of 2014. That end date is three years beyond the time that Obama has said he will start withdrawing U.S. troops, and the challenge is to avoid a rush to the exits as public opinion turns more sharply against the war and Afghan President Hamid Karzai pushes for greater Afghan control. While celebrating the missile shield decision, Obama also made a renewed pitch for Senate ratification back in the U.S. of a nuclear arms treaty with Russia, asserting that Europeans believe rejection of the deal would hurt their security and damage relations with the Russians. Two key unanswered questions about the missile shield — will it work and can the Europeans afford it? — were put aside for the present in the interest of celebrating the agreement as a boost for NATO solidarity. \\"It offers a role for all of our allies,\\" Obama told reporters. \\"It responds to the threats of our times. It shows our determination to protect our citizens from the threat of ballistic missiles.\\" He did not mention Iran by name, acceding to the wishes of NATO member Turkey, which had threatened to block the deal if its neighbor was singled out. Under the arrangement, a limited system of U.S. anti-missile interceptors and radars already planned for Europe — to include interceptors in Romania and Poland and possibly a radar in Turkey — would be linked to expanded European-owned missile defenses. That would create a broad system that protects every NATO country against medium-range missile attack. NATO plans to invite Russia to join the missile shield effort, although Moscow would not be given joint control. The gesture would mark a historic milestone for the alliance, created after World War II to defend Western Europe against the threat of an invasion by Soviet forces. As for the U.S.-Russia arms treaty, Obama was backed by NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen of Denmark, who told reporters that the treaty, called New START and signed last April by Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, would improve security not only in Europe but beyond. \\"I would strongly regret if it is delayed,\\" Fogh Rasmussen said. \\"A delay would be damaging for security in Europe, and I urge all parties involved to ratify it.\\" Obama needs 67 votes in the Senate for ratification, and many Republicans have balked at even taking a vote before the new, more heavily GOP Congress convenes in January. The allies opened their summit by agreeing on the first rewrite of NATO's basic mission — formally called its \\"strategic concept\\" — since 1999. They reaffirmed their bedrock commitment that an attack on one would be treated as an attack on all. In that context, the agreement to build a missile defense for all of Europe is meant to strengthen the alliance. What remains in conflict, however, is the question of the future role of nuclear weapons in NATO's basic strategy. The document members agreed to Friday says NATO will retain an \\"appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional capabilities\\" to deter a potential aggressor. Germany and some other NATO members want U.S. nuclear weapons withdrawn from Europe. Non-government advocates of the German view were quick to criticize what they saw as a missed opportunity here for further nuclear disarmament. \\"In an astonishing demonstration of weakness, NATO heads of state have failed to tackle the Cold War legacy of the deployment of U.S. nuclear gravity bombs in Europe, threatening the credibility of NATO members' claims to be interested in non-proliferation and global disarmament,\\" said Paul Ingram, executive director of the British American Security Information Council in London. The specter of continued stalemate in Afghanistan hung over the Lisbon summit. Karzai will be joining the NATO allies for the Saturday session, and Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, is to make a closed-door presentation spelling out his vision of how to make a transition to Afghan control. Petraeus is expected to emphasize that stepped-up military operations this year, with the addition of thousands more U.S. combat troops, have made strides toward weakening the Taliban and eventually creating the conditions for peace negotiations. But he also is believed to be concerned that the transition not turn into a departure before Afghanistan is stable. Obama said Afghanistan, launch pad for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, must get ready for the start of a shift away from reliance on U.S. and NATO combat power \\"as we move toward a new phase, a transition to Afghan responsibility beginning in 2011 with Afghan forces taking the lead for security across Afghanistan by 2014.\\" A key question: Will Afghan security forces and the central government be ready to take full responsibility by then? Mark Sedwill, the top NATO civilian official in Afghanistan, told reporters in Lisbon that it was possible the transition could be completed before 2014, although it's not yet clear whether even that date will mark the end of NATO combat there. A member of Karzai's delegation to the summit, former Afghan finance minister Ashraf Ghani, said in an Associated Press interview that once 2014 is set as the target date, NATO needs to work with Kabul to establish milestones to get there. \\"We as Afghans are responsive to our public opinion, and our public opinion is raising these issues, and what is fortunate is now, NATO has become ... a listening organization,\\" Ghani said on the sidelines of the summit. Stating the U.S. view in clear terms, Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell had said Thursday that 2014 is an \\"aspirational goal,\\" not a deadline either for Afghan forces to take full control or for a complete withdrawal of U.S. forces. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who met privately with Karzai on Friday, said earlier that despite the economic burdens faced by much of Europe and the U.S., she believes the war campaign must go on. \\"The challenge posed by radical extremists who utilize terror to promote their agenda is one that threatens the people of Portugal, the people of Europe, the people of the United States and, indeed, nations around the world,\\" Clinton said. Her comments seemed aimed at slowing any rush to withdrawal by allies who believe military force is not the solution in Afghanistan. Canada, for example, is ending its combat mission next year while keeping 950 troops there in a support role. The summit comes in a pivotal period for NATO, whose relevance is questioned by some who view the alliance as a relic. The adversary that prompted NATO's creation in 1949 — the Soviet Union along with its Warsaw Pact allies — no longer exists. After NATO's rapid expansion over the past decade and a half — growing from 16 members to 28 — the gap in military prowess between the U.S. and most of the rest of the alliance has widened to the point where the basic nature of the defense partnership is in doubt. Rasmussen told Friday's opening session that it's time for NATO countries to start \\"cutting fat and investing in muscle.\\" This is where the U.S. push for a NATO missile defense comes in. It would require a lot of money from European countries — estimated at 200 million euros, or about 260 million, over 10 years — and a commitment to a more active type of defense. It also risks aggravating Russia, which has expressed worry that missile defenses could undermine the deterrent value of its own nuclear arsenal. Ivo Daalder, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, took a positive view of prospects for working with Moscow. \\"I believe we will find Russia and NATO will now decide that this is a time we move forward together on how to cooperate,\\" said Daalder, though he said Saturday's meetings weren't likely to result in concrete agreements on missile defense cooperation. Associated Press writers Slobodan Lekic, Alan Clendenning and Barry Hatton contributed to this report.

It depicts a dystopian future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called \\"the Matrix\\", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer \\"Neo\\" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the \\"dream world\\".  - The Invasion is a 2007 science fiction thriller horror film starring Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig , directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel , with additional scenes written by The Wachowskis and directed by James McTeigue . The Invasion is the fourth film adaptation of the 1955 novel The Body Snatchers by Jack Finney , following Don Siegel 's 1956 film Invasion of the Body Snatchers , Philip Kaufman 's 1978 remake of the same name , and Abel Ferrara 's 1993 Body Snatchers .  - Ninja Assassin is a 2009 German-American neo-noir martial arts thriller film directed by James McTeigue. The story was written by Matthew Sand, with a screenplay by J. Michael Straczynski. The film stars South Korean pop musician Rain as a disillusioned assassin looking for retribution against his former mentor, played by ninja film legend Sho Kosugi. \\"Ninja Assassin\\" explores political corruption, child endangerment and the impact of violence. Known for their previous work on the \\"Matrix Trilogy\\" and \\"V for Vendetta\\", Lana and Lilly Wachowski, Joel Silver, and Grant Hill produced the film. A collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by Legendary Pictures, Dark Castle Entertainment and Silver Pictures. It was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures.  - A Kid in King Arthur's Court is a 1995 Disney family film directed by Michael Gottlieb. It is based on the famous Mark Twain novel \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" (previously filmed by Disney as \\"Unidentified Flying Oddball\\" in 1978 in which Ron Moody also played Merlin), transplanted into the twentieth century. Trimark later released a sequel, \\"A Kid in Aladdin's Palace\\", in 1998, but without Disney's involvement. Since Trimark's dissolution, the sequel is now distributed by Lions Gate Entertainment.  - James McTeigue (born 29 December 1967) is an Australian film director. He has been an assistant director on many films, including \\"Dark City\\" (1998), the \\"Matrix trilogy\\" (19992003) and \\"\\" (2002), and made his directorial debut with the 2006 film \\"V for Vendetta\\" to critical acclaim. Since \\"Vendetta\\" he has collaborated with the Wachowskis an additional three times as director on \\"The Invasion\\" (albeit uncredited), \\"Ninja Assassin\\" and \\"Sense8\\".  - The role of an assistant director on a film includes tracking daily progress against the filming production schedule, arranging logistics, preparing daily call sheets, checking cast and crew, and maintaining order on the set. They also have to take care of the health and safety of the crew. The role of an assistant to the director is often confused with assistant director but the responsibilities are entirely different. The assistant to the director manages all of the Director's in development, pre-production, while on set, through post-production and is often involved in both personal management as well as creative aspects of the production process. Historically, assistant to director was a stepping stone to directing work; Alfred Hitchcock was an AD, as was James McTeigue. This transition into film directing is no longer common in feature films. It is more common now for an assistant to the director to transition to a production management or producer role than to directing.   - Lana Wachowski (formerly Laurence \\"Larry\\" Wachowski, born June 21, 1965) and Lilly Wachowski (formerly Andrew Paul \\"Andy\\" Wachowski, born December 29, 1967) are sister American film directors, screenwriters, and producers. They are both transwomen. Known together professionally as The Wachowskis and formerly as The Wachowski Brothers, the pair made their directing debut in 1996 with \\"Bound\\", and reached fame with their second film \\"The Matrix\\" (1999), a major box office success for which they won the Saturn Award for Best Director. They wrote and directed its two sequels: \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" and \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" (both in 2003), and were deeply involved in the writing and production of other works in the franchise.  - The National Youth Theatre is a registered charity in London. It is committed to the development of young people through the medium of creative arts, and aims to use theatre to aid in this objective. It was founded in 1956 as the world's first youth theatre and has built a reputation as a breeding ground for renowned actors such as Daniel Craig, Daniel Day-Lewis, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Idris Elba, Colin Firth, Derek Jacobi, Ben Kingsley, Ian McShane, Helen Mirren, Rosamund Pike, and Kate Winslet, as well as musicians such as Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Ed Sheeran (see for a full list).

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  they were shot  for the following movie plot:  In early 1943, World War II British prisoners arrive by train at a Japanese prison camp in Burma. The commandant, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), informs them that all prisoners, regardless of rank, are to work on the construction of a railway bridge over the River Kwai that will connect Bangkok and Rangoon. The senior British officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), reminds Saito that the Geneva Conventions exempt officers from manual labour. At the following morning's assembly, Nicholson orders his officers to remain behind when the enlisted men are sent off to work. Saito slaps him across the face with his copy of the conventions and threatens to have them shot, but Nicholson refuses to back down. When Major Clipton (James Donald), the British medical officer, intervenes, telling Saito there are too many witnesses for him to get away with murdering the officers, Saito leaves the officers standing all day in the intense tropical heat. That evening, the officers are placed in a punishment hut, while Nicholson is locked in an iron box. Meanwhile, three prisoners attempt to escape. Two are shot dead, but United States Navy Commander Shears (William Holden), gets away, although badly wounded. He stumbles into a village of natives who help him leave by boat. Nicholson refuses to compromise. Meanwhile, the prisoners are working as little as possible and sabotaging whatever they can. Should Saito fail to meet his deadline, he would be obliged to commit ritual suicide. Desperate, Saito uses the anniversary of Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War as an excuse to save face and announces a general amnesty, releasing Nicholson and his officers from manual labor. Nicholson conducts an inspection and is shocked by the poor job being done by his men. Over the protests of some of his officers, he allows Captain Reeves (Peter Williams) and Major Hughes (John Boxer) to design and build a proper bridge, despite its military value to the Japanese, for the sake of maintaining his men's morale.

After interviewing Jake at the crime scene, Hasim and Jake are attacked by terrorists led by Malik and his henchman Achmed. Jake saves Hashim and kills two terrorists, but Achmed manages to escape.

Article: If it is not available, you will be less tempted. Fueling yourself properly at the beginning of the day ensures that you don’t put your body in starvation mode by lunchtime. Starvation mode essentially means that your body holds on to fat, even if you don’t eat much. It also ensures that when you do eat, you will overindulge to compensate. Try to make sure your breakfast is balanced nutritionally, including a good source of protein. Many popular breakfasts are very carbohydrate-heavy with little protein, making you hungry much sooner. Make sure to take at least 20 minutes to eat your meal or snack. Eating slowly gives the brain a chance to be satisfied. Slow eating will help you avoid eating more than is necessary to feel full. Take the time to appreciate the foods that you are eating. You will receive more satisfaction out of your meal by savoring it than if you quickly scarf it down. Try replacing three large meals a day with six smaller meals. There is evidence that suggests an association between more eating occasions and lower BMI. The theory is that eating more frequently will help keep you fuller throughout your day because your energy levels will be more stable, as will your blood sugar levels.  Try having protein at meals and snacks. This will help keep you full for longer periods of time. Beans, lean meats, and nuts are effective for this purpose. Consider eating a snack like cottage cheese before bed. Your body takes longer to break down the casein protein contained in cottage cheese; therefore, your metabolism will be working all night. Treating yourself with junk food once a week can undo all of your week’s hard work. One slice of cheesecake, for example, can be over 1,000 calories. If you really need something sweet, try eating a piece of fruit instead.  Dessert usually consists of bad carbohydrates that also leave you feeling hungry quickly. If you want a frozen treat, try freezing grapes or blueberries. You can also mash a banana and add a teaspoon of honey for an ice cream-like treat. Restaurants focus on serving delicious food, not healthy food. Besides being tempted to order something you know is unhealthy, you may order something you think is healthy only to consume more calories than you thought. For example, the Garlic Rosemary Chicken at Olive Garden is 540 calories; however, when you add the sides, you could end up eating over 1,000 calories for a meal without knowing it.

Q:I have a new situation: Michael and Robert are two patients at a cardiology clinic. Both just received their blood test results and were told that they need to improve their cholesterol levels. They were each recommended to make changes to their diets. Michael took this advice to heart, and reduced the levels of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol he consumed. Robert, on the other hand, continued to consume high levels of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol.  But I can use this background: Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol.  What is an answer for this question: Who will be at lower risk for atherosclerosis in the future? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Michael will be at lower risk for atherosclerosis in the future. This is because he has made changes to his diet by reducing the levels of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol he consumed. These dietary changes help lower his LDL (\\"bad\\") cholesterol levels, which reduces the risk of plaque buildup and atherosclerosis. Additionally, if Michael incorporates regular aerobic exercise, this can further lower his LDL cholesterol and increase his HDL (\\"good\\") cholesterol, further decreasing his risk for atherosclerosis.

It is a useful tool for discovering which of your friends are nearby, so you can plan for meet-ups or events. The Nearby Friends feature works by utilizing the GPS technology on your smartphone. When you enable the Nearby Friends feature, your location will be shared with your friends who are also using the feature. This information is gathered from the location services on your phone, which uses a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi signals, and cell tower data to determine your precise location. This, in turn, helps Facebook display your friends on the map based on their proximity to you. Regarding the distance shown on Nearby Friends, Facebook considers a point-to-point (or straight line) distance rather than the distance by road. As such, the distance measured may not be the exact distance one would need to travel by foot, bike, or car, but it provides a reasonable estimate of how far apart you and your friends are in terms of proximity. The accuracy of Nearby Friends depends on various factors, including the quality of your phone's GPS and the strength of the Wi-Fi signals and cell tower reception in your area. Generally, the accuracy can range from a few meters to several hundred meters. It might not be perfect, but it usually provides a good approximation of your friends' locations. As for liking and commenting on someone's Facebook post who is not in your friend list, it is not necessarily a mistake. If the original poster has set their privacy settings to \\"public,\\" they are allowing anybody to view, like, and comment on their content.

Gregory John Norman AO (born 10 February 1955) is an Australian professional golfer and entrepreneur who spent 331 weeks as the world's Number 1 Official World Golf Rankings ranked golfer in the 1980s and 1990s. He has won 91 international tournaments, including 20 PGA Tour tournaments and two majors: The Open Championships in 1986 and 1993. Norman also earned thirty top-10 finishes and was the runner-up 8 times in majors throughout his career. Norman endured another setback at the 1987 Masters. In his final round on the 18th green, Norman had a 20-foot putt for a birdie that would win the tournament. The ball trickled over the left lip of the cup, missing by millimetres. After Norman's par on the 72nd hole at Augusta, he found himself in a sudden-death playoff with Larry Mize and Seve Ballesteros. On the second playoff hole, with Ballesteros eliminated, Mize holed a 47-yard (140-foot) chip to win the tournament. Norman did, however, win the Australian Masters in February 1987 and the Australian Open later in the year by a record ten shots at Royal Melbourne Golf Club, beating the previous Australian Open record winning margin of eight strokes by Jack Nicklaus in 1971. Norman's 1987 victory at the Australian Open lifted him back above Seve Ballesteros to the top of the Official World Golf Ranking.  Norman had another four wins in Australia in 1988. In the U.S., Norman won the MCI Heritage Golf Classic at Hilton Head Island, South Carolina in April 1988, inspired by a leukemia-stricken teenager who got his wish to meet Norman and watch him play. The teenager was only supposed to watch the golfer for two rounds, but Norman arranged for him to stay until the tournament's completion. After the tournament, Norman awarded the teen with the trophy. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in that year.  At the 1989 Masters, Norman missed a 12-foot par putt on the 72nd hole which would have put him into a playoff with Nick Faldo and Scott Hoch. Norman had another chance at a major in 1989, this time at the Open Championship at Royal Troon. He played a final-round of 64, starting his round with six straight birdies, to force his way into a playoff with Mark Calcavecchia and Wayne Grady. Going into the final playoff hole, Norman and Calcavecchia were tied, but two successive bunker shots by Norman gave Calcavecchia the victory.  Norman won the Doral-Ryder Open and Memorial Tournament in March 1990 after having missed the cut for the first time at the 1990 Masters. In the 1990 Open Championship at St Andrews, Norman began with two rounds of 66, leaving himself sharing the lead with Nick Faldo after 36 holes and the pair four shots ahead of the rest of the field. Faldo then shot a third round of 67, but Norman could only manage 76. Norman finished the tournament tied for sixth place, while Faldo won by five shots. Although 1990 was not Norman's strongest majors year, he finished at the top of the PGA Tour money list for the second time in his career and won the Vardon Trophy and Byron Nelson Award. Later that year, he won the Australian Masters in his home country for a final and record sixth time.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: In 1987 to 1990 did he win any tournaments?","output":"Yes, between 1987 and 1990, Gregory John Norman won several tournaments.

White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members.

Rabbitt was born to Irish immigrants Mae (nee Joyce) and Thomas Michael Rabbitt in Brooklyn, New York in 1941, and was raised in the nearby community of East Orange, New Jersey. His father was an oil-refinery refrigeration worker, and a skilled fiddle and accordion player, who often entertained in local New York City dance halls. By age twelve Rabbitt was a proficient guitar player, having been taught by his scoutmaster, Bob Scwickrath. During his childhood Rabbitt became a self-proclaimed \\"walking encyclopedia of country music\\". While he was still relatively unknown, Rabbitt toured with and opened for crossover star Kenny Rogers, and also opened for Dolly Parton on a number of dates during her 1978 tour, but soon Rabbitt would himself break through on other charts. Following the 1978 release of Variations, which included two more No. 1 hits, Rabbitt released his first compilation album, The Best of Eddie Rabbitt. The album produced Rabbitt's first crossover single of his career, \\"Every Which Way But Loose\\", which topped Country charts and reached the top 30 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary, and was featured in a 1978 Clint Eastwood movie of the same name. The song also broke the record for highest chart debut, entering at No. 18. Rabbitt held this record until it was shared with Garth Brooks at the debut of Brooks' 2005 single \\"Good Ride Cowboy.\\" The record was broken in 2006 upon the No. 17 chart entrance of Keith Urban's \\"Once in a Lifetime.\\" Rabbitt's next single, the R&B flavored \\"Suspicions\\" from his 1979 album Loveline, was an even greater crossover success, again reaching number one on Country charts and the top 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary. He was given his own television special on NBC, first airing on July 10, 1980, which included appearances by such performers as Emmylou Harris and Jerry Lee Lewis.

Would \\"Pregnancies with this diagnosis are often terminated .\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","output":"The lifespan of an individual with Down's syndrome varies depending on multiple factors such as genetics, health conditions, and access to medical care. In general, people with Down's syndrome have a shorter life expectancy compared to the general population. Over the past few decades, medical advancements and improved social support have contributed to a significant increase in life expectancy for individuals with Down's syndrome. Currently, the average life expectancy for a person with Down's syndrome is about 60 years, although some individuals live well into their 70s and beyond. The statement \\"Pregnancies with this diagnosis are often terminated.\\" is a separate topic from the life expectancy of individuals with Down's syndrome. Prenatal testing, such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis, can detect Down's syndrome in a developing fetus. When a prenatal test shows a high probability of Down's syndrome, some parents may choose to terminate the pregnancy due to concerns about the child's quality of life, potential health complications, and the long-term financial and emotional impact on the family. However, this decision is deeply personal and varies widely among families, depending on their beliefs, culture, and resources. Down's syndrome is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21, leading to a range of physical and intellectual challenges, including developmental delays, learning disabilities, and an increased risk of certain health issues such as congenital heart defects, respiratory and hearing problems, Alzheimer's disease, and childhood leukemia. However, with appropriate support and interventions, individuals with Down's syndrome can lead fulfilling lives, participate in social activities, and, in some cases, hold jobs and live independently. Early intervention services, including special education, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy, can significantly improve cognitive and motor skills in individuals with Down's syndrome. Additionally, advances in medical care, such as corrective heart surgery and treatments for other health complications, have contributed to improved health outcomes and life expectancy. In summary, the lifespan of a Down's syndrome individual varies based on various factors, but in recent years, the life expectancy has increased to around 60 years on average. The decision to terminate a pregnancy with a Down's syndrome diagnosis is a separate, personal issue that varies among families. Medical and developmental support play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life and overall health and well-being for individuals with Down's syndrome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise focuses on their unique traits and tolerances, while the hypothesis claims they are very normal. Step 4: Evaluate the relationship between the premise and hypothesis In order to evaluate the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, we must determine if having unique quirks and tolerances can coexist with being very normal. While having unique traits could make someone more interesting or unusual, it does not necessarily mean they are abnormal. On the other hand, someone who is considered \\"very normal\\" may still have their own quirks and tolerances.  Step 5: Determine if the premise supports the hypothesis The premise does not directly contradict the hypothesis; however, it also does not provide enough information to conclude that the hypothesis is true. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis remains inconclusive.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: While it can be surprising to encounter a snake while weeding your garden or walking around your yard, having a snake around isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, you should be proud - a good snake population in an area is a sign that the ecosystem there is healthy. In addition, snakes play an important role in keeping other pests, like mice and rats, from taking over. So if a snake isn't eating your chicken's eggs or otherwise being a bother, consider sharing your yard with it instead of trapping it and moving it elsewhere.  Rat snakes and gopher snakes are especially beneficial to have around. They're as good as cats for keeping the rodent population down.  King snakes go one step further and eat rattlesnakes. In fact, if you get rid of a king snake, the rattlesnakes are more likely to move in - and then you'll have a much more serious problem on your hands. If you don't like snakes, a great way to keep them away is to make your yard less snake-friendly. Snakes hang out in areas that are a little unkempt and wild. They like tall grass, brush piles, wood piles, and other sources of shelter. To make your yard less inviting, do the following:  Mow the lawn regularly. Get rid of piles of rocks, leaves, brush, bricks, or anything else that a snake could use as shelter. Keep your rodent population down by cleaning up acorns, sealing your trash, and removing other sources of food for rodents. If you've been finding snakes in your attic or basement, look for cracks and holes that might be letting them in. Make sure the doors and windows are sealed around the edges. Screen the chimney, vents, and any other spots that could serve as an entryway for a snake. Snake experts seem to agree that most repellents aren't effective, but they might be worth a try if you've exhausted other ideas. Try putting one of the following substances in your garden, chicken coop or wherever you have a snake problem:  Spray a solution made with fox urine around the perimeter of your property. Some say that snakes are deterred by the smell of their predators' urine. You can find this solution in home and garden stores. Try putting rags soaked in ammonia around the yard. This substance is said to repel snakes and other animals. Put human hair clippings around your garden. The smell of the hair is said to keep snakes away. Summary:","output":"Encountering a snake in your garden or yard may initially be surprising, but having snakes around can actually be beneficial for maintaining a healthy ecosystem. Snakes are effective in controlling pest populations like mice and rats.

The Vice President stated that he called the President to discuss the rules of engagement for the CAP. He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, \\"Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're going to want to know what to do.\\" Then she recalled hearing him say, \\"Yes sir.\\" She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes, perhaps five, after they entered the conference room. We believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15. Among the sources that reflect other important events of that morning, there is no documentary evidence for this call, but the relevant sources are incomplete. Others nearby who were taking notes, such as the Vice President's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, who sat next to him, and Mrs. Cheney, did not note a call between the President and Vice President immediately after the Vice President entered the conference room.

In 2004, the city of New Haven introduced its first bike lane on Orange Street, which aimed to establish a connection between East Rock Park and the East Rock neighborhood to the downtown area. This initiative was taken to promote the use of alternative transportation modes, as well as to enhance the accessibility and connectivity within the city. The East Rock neighborhood is a highly diverse and vibrant area in the city of New Haven, known for its rich culture, beautiful natural landscape, and the renowned East Rock Park. This park is a popular destination for city dwellers as well as residents from nearby areas, attracting thousands of visitors each year. With a multitude of recreational opportunities such as hiking trails, playing fields, picnic areas, the Soldiers and Sailors monument, fostering a connection between the neighborhood and downtown through the Orange Street bike lane was a significant step to enhance connectivity and encourage greener transportation practices. The Orange Street bike lane made it easier for residents of East Rock and visitors to East Rock Park to commute to and from the downtown area by providing a dedicated access route for cyclists. This bike lane serves as an integral part of the city’s cycling infrastructure and has contributed to improving the overall quality of life for many city residents. The better connected a neighborhood is to vital city centers, the more accessible jobs, services, and amenities become for the local population, in turn leading to a more thriving community overall. Since the inception of the Orange Street bike lane, New Haven has continued to expand its bike lane network and has made substantial efforts to improve overall bikeability within the city. These efforts not only support the increasing bicycle commuting population but also reflect the city’s commitment to promoting sustainable, environmentally friendly transportation choices for its residents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given a scientific question, generate a correct answer to it. What kind of solids are gummi bears or taffy?","output":"Gummi bears and taffy are examples of amorphous solids in scientific terms.  An amorphous solid is a type of solid that lacks a well-defined ordered structure unlike crystalline solids which have a very regular structure pattern. Amorphous solids do not have a long-range periodic arrangement of their atoms or molecules. This is why they do not exhibit a definite geometric or crystal shape, or have definite melting point. The structural arrangement in gummi bears and taffies comes due to the complex, long, intertwined polymer chains. When we heat or chew these candies, energy supplied makes the polymer chains slide past each other, thus changing the shape of the candy without breaking it - a characteristic behavior of amorphous solids.  Gummi bears are made primarily from a mixture of sugar, glucose syrup, starch, flavoring, food coloring, citric acid, and gelatin while taffy is made with sugar, cornstarch, corn syrup, glycerin, water, butter, salt, flavor, and food color. These components, when mixed, heated and cooled in a proper controlled procedure provide the respective characteristics to these candies. So scientifically, gummi bears and taffy are considered to be amorphous solids rather than crystalline solids."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Great deal for Happy Hour ! Discounted prices for appetizers and meats. Its like 3 for an order of pork belly or beef toro (brisket).   Came here for \\"dinner\\" before an event i had to go to, with a friend. She had been here before and was on the way, so had me order (before it hit the end of Happy Hour time). She liked the Pork Belly and Pork Toro.   Service by this young korean waitress was superb. Very friendly and funny.   We had ordered 3 pork belly, 1 pork toro, 2 toro beef, and 1 prime kalbi.   The pork toro (pork cheek) isn't discounted. - 5.95 - As the \\"toro\\" name suggests, it is highly marbleized with some thick areas of fat on the edges. This isn't the first time i've had pork cheek (similar to pork neck meat as well). When cooked properly, and a good quality meat, it should have a super tender texture, and \\"crispy\\". Not like a hard crispy but like crisp to bite through. I cooked it in a way where it seared the fat giving it a nice crisp in the fat. The pork toro is NOT marinated or seasoned in any way. Quality, to me, seems not up to what i had imagined. Overall still not bad, but could be better. But pork cheek/neck meat is quite expensive. somewhere along 10-15/lb, wholesale. X_x   Prime kalbi - 8.45 - quality wise, wasnt that good either. For them to put the \\"prime\\" name, id expect a high quality cut of meat, flavorful and tender. Not to the point of aged meats, but you know what i mean. The prime kalbi is seasoned with some slight marinade topped with some finely minced garlic? Pieces are a fair thickness. Cooks nicely. Not as tender as i hoped, nor was it as marbleized as i have had this cut in other places.   Toro Beef - 3.45 - otherwise quoted as \\"Beef Brisket\\". By no means it is the Toro i was thinking of. It is straight up brisket, similar to that of what you get any where else. Misleading name, but i guess it was my fault for believing it may be more towards to the Toro name vs the quoted brisket name. Thin slices of meat. Cooks fast. Simple as that.   Pork belly - 2.95 - surprisingly, this was probably the best of the 4 items we had ordered. Even compared to the pork toro or prime kalbi. sad but surprising. Lol. Simple pork belly cuts.   Overall, not bad experience. Priced fair during happy hour. Pretty sure i wouldn't be ordering the meats not during happy hour though. Nice place to try if you are in the area.

Ferrier gave her first London recital on 28 December 1942 at the National Gallery, in a lunch-time concert organised by Dame Myra Hess. Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\". Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che farò (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca. At Glyndebourne, Ferrier's limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor, Fritz Stiedry; nevertheless her performance on the first night, 19 June 1947, attracted warm critical praise.Ferrier's association...

Summarize the following: Many misconceptions about homeschooling come from a lack of information or knowledge about what homeschooling entails. While you are most likely familiar with the benefits of homeschooling, it is often useful to have a wide pool of facts to draw upon when you confront misconceptions. Education research can provide you with facts and statistics that can help you to better explain your decision. The National Home Education Research Institute, HSLDA, and the Coalition for Responsible Home Education are all great sources for research on homeschooling. Many people worry that homeschooled children do not have the same opportunities to socialize as traditionally schooled children. People may ask, \\"What do your children do to make friends?\\" You can share the ways that you've involved them in groups and you can say that, \\"Our children see their friends as frequently as they would if they were in a public school.\\"  There are many ways that children have the opportunity to spend time with other children. You can enroll your child in an organized sports league, join homeschooling groups that take field trips, participate in religious organizations, and being active in your community. Homeschooling does not mean that you want to deprive your child of socialization opportunities, but it can protect them from some of the more negative social aspects of the public school system, like bullying. If someone is curious about your decision to homeschool, feel free to share your reasons for coming to the decision to begin homeschooling with them. Don’t feel obligated to share reasons if they are personal. Of course, the reasons that factored into your decision to homeschool may be intimate and private. You are under no obligation to share more information than you are willing to share. Summary:","output":"Misconceptions about homeschooling often stem from a lack of information.

Hotshot businessman Bill Campbell has returned to his hometown of Buzzsaw at the request of his younger sister Marci, who is convinced that their stepfather Mayor Van Der Haven has been murdered and replaced by his twin brother Matt Skearns. On the way to Buzzsaw, Bill's car and clothes (including his wallet which contains an important contact number) are stolen by a woman named Sally and he is forced to hitchhike home naked, where he is picked up by two drunken brothers—both named Jim (Monks and Reilly). Over the course of the day, Campbell must find Sally, retrieve his wallet, and avoid the diabolical Skearns, who is looking for financial compensation after spending 15 years in prison for a crime committed by his twin brother. The film ends with Skearns driving off a cliff and into a canyon, rather than risk capture by the police. Marci, who tells her classmates what happened, introduces them to her brother and his wife, Sally. Marci also tells her classmates that the Jim brothers were congratulated as heroes for trying to bring a criminal to justice.

What is the title of this article: Breathing is largely driven by the muscular diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome with its convexity towards the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing the volume of the cavity in which the lung is enclosed. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities; it flows through the larynx, trachea and bronchi and expands the alveoli. Relaxation of the diaphragm has the opposite effect, passively recoiling during normal breathing. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing visceral pressure on the diaphragm, thus forcing the air out more quickly and forcefully. The rib cage itself also is able to expand and contract the thoracic cavity to some degree, through the action of other respiratory and accessory respiratory muscles. As a result, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung as it resembles a blacksmith's bellows. Mammals take oxygen into their lungs, and discard carbon dioxide.","output":"The title of this article could be \\"How Breathing Works in Mammals.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.  and the situation: Italy and Greece attended the World Ecological Conference. they were looking for solutions to improve their environment. Italy's air was very polluted, while Greece had problems with drought.  Answer the following question: Which country had less acid precipitation fall in forests? A:","output":"Given the background information, it is likely that Greece experienced less acid precipitation fall in forests compared to Italy. One of the main reasons behind this conclusion is the mention of different environmental issues faced by each country. Italy is specifically mentioned to have problems with air pollution, which is a major contributor to acid rain. The sulfur oxides released from coal-fired power plants and nitrogen oxides caused by motor vehicle exhaust are two primary sources of acid rain, and both are prevalent in a highly polluted environment. On the other hand, Greece is facing issues with drought, which implies that the country may be experiencing less precipitation overall. In this case, less precipitation typically correlates with less acid rain. Furthermore, the specific problem of drought faced by Greece suggests that the country may not have substantial air pollution, or at least not at the same level as Italy. While it is not possible to provide a definitive answer without actual data, given the background information provided, it is more likely that Greece experiences less acid precipitation fall in forests compared to Italy. This is primarily due to Italy's high levels of air pollution which contribute to the formation of acid rain, and Greece's issues with drought, which indicate less precipitation overall."},{"instruction":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Can you tell me the answer to who wrote the original snow white and the seven dwarfs??","output":"\\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" is a German fairy tale that was first published by the Brothers Grimm, Jacob and Wilhelm, in 1812 as part of their collection called \\"Kinder- und Hausmärchen,\\" or \\"Children's and Household Tales\\" (more well-known today as \\"Grimm's Fairy Tales\\"). The story is known in German as \\"Schneewittchen,\\" and it is one of the most famous and enduring European fairy tales. However, it's important to note that the Brothers Grimm did not create the story themselves; instead, they collected and recorded folktales from various sources, including oral traditions and earlier written works, and edited them to create the versions we know today. The origins of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs can be traced back to ancient European myths and legends, and similar stories can be found in various cultures. One possible early influence for the story comes from the ancient Roman myth of Chione, who was so beautiful that she claimed to be more beautiful than Diana, the goddess of the hunt. In response, Diana hunted down Chione and killed her with an arrow. Furthermore, various versions of a story featuring a wicked stepmother, a jealous queen, and a beautiful young girl can be found throughout European folklore. Some scholars also point to the German countess Margarete von Waldeck as a possible historical figure behind the story of Snow White. Born in 1533, Margarete was known for her beauty and grew up in a mining town where child labor was common, which might have inspired the seven dwarfs. Furthermore, the stepmother aspect of the story might have come from Margarete's own life, as she had a difficult relationship with her father's second wife. She later moved to the Spanish royal court, and some rumors suggest that she was poisoned there. While the origins of the tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs can be traced back to various sources, the version popularized by the Brothers Grimm remains the most widely recognized and has been adapted into numerous forms over the years, including the classic 1937 animated film by Walt Disney."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:I read this background article the other day: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.  The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.  A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.  I am facing a new situation today: Ann decided to candy half of the fruit he received as a gift. She kept the other half to eat fresh and do juicing. She candied ginger, plums pears, and she didn't candy apples, oranges apricots and bananas.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which fruit contains more crystallized sugar, plums or apricots? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, Ann has candied the ginger, plums, and pears, while she did not candy the apples, oranges, apricots, and bananas. As the question asks about the crystallized sugar content in plums and apricots, it is important to note that only plums were candied in this situation, while apricots were not. Therefore, the plums will have more crystallized sugar content because they have undergone the sugaring process. In contrast, the apricots have not been subject to sugaring and do not contain additional crystallized sugar apart from their natural sugar content."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: One of the more surprising objects in the Getty Villa’s newly reinstalled gallery of later Roman sculpture is a marble bust of a youth leaning out of a circular frame, mounted high on the gallery wall. J. Paul Getty originally acquired this particular sculpture in 1973, but it has been off view for many years. The recent reinstallation of the Getty Museum’s antiquities collection at the Villa provided the opportunity to resurrect many such objects from storage and put them on display. Bringing this strange object back to the public eye enabled us to ask—and answer—several questions about it. Who—if anyone—does it represent? When was it carved? Where was it made, and how did it end up in Los Angeles? In preparation for its display, we researched and reinterpreted the object, exploring both its ancient function and modern history. In its new display, this object is fittingly surrounded by other examples of late Roman sculpture from the third and fourth centuries. Its inclusion in this gallery was not always a given, however, as the figure was long misidentified as a portrait of young Caracalla, who at ten years old became joint emperor with his father in A.D. 198.(1) But recent scholarship questioned the Caracalla identification and the object’s date, suggesting it was carved at least a hundred years later.(2) In light of this research, curator Jens Daehner pushed to reexamine the sculpture and consider including it in the reinstallation. In early 2015, the Antiquities Department brought this tondo and many other potential objects for the new galleries out of storage for viewing, providing curators, conservators, mount makers, preps, and registrars a chance to approve and prepare artworks for possible display. After the storage viewing and subsequent research, we updated the object record to conform with what scholars had suggested: this is not a second-century portrait of Caracalla but a fourth-century bust of a youth or divinity. To answer our next question of who the tondo represents, we then had to take a... Question: Where was the marble portrait first displayed?

Question: What century does A Knight's tale take place in? Movie title: A Knight's Tale Movie plot: At a jousting tournament in 14th-century Europe, young squires William Thatcher, Roland, and Wat discover that their master, Sir Ector, has died. If he had completed one final pass he would have won the tournament. Destitute, William wears Ector's armour to impersonate him, winning the tournament and taking the prize. Although only nobles are allowed in tournaments, William is now inspired to compete and win more prizes. Roland and Wat would rather take their share of coins and leave, but William convinces them to stay and train him to joust. Along the way to his first tournament in Rouen, the trio encounters a young Geoffrey Chaucer, who is also destitute and agrees to forge the patent of nobility that will allow William to enter under the assumed name of \\"Sir Ulrich von Liechtenstein\\" from Gelderland. At the tournament, William is brought before Simon the Summoner and Peter the Pardoner: Chaucer has a gambling problem and is in their debt. William demands Chaucer be released and promises payment. In the course of competition, William's armour is damaged. He goads Kate, a female blacksmith, to repair it without payment and goes on to win the sword event at the tournament. In the joust, he faces a Sir Thomas Colville, who withdraws from the tournament after being injured by William, though they exchange a ceremonial pass so that Colville can retain the honour of never having failed to complete a match. The proceedings are observed by Jocelyn, a noblewoman with whom William has become infatuated, and Count Adhemar, a rival both in the joust and for Jocelyn's heart. In the final joust of the tournament, Adhemar defeats William. Kate joins William's party and forges new lightweight armour allowing him greater mobility. In the following tournament, Adhemar and William are both assigned to tilt against Sir Thomas Colville, but they learn that he is actually Edward, the Black Prince.

When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block.

On October 10, approximately 125 volunteers, including 30 Tejanos, stormed the presidio.  The Mexican garrison surrendered after a thirty-minute battle. One or two Texians were wounded and three Mexican soldiers were killed with seven more wounded.The Texians established themselves in the presidio, under the command of Captain Philip Dimmitt, who immediately sent all the local Tejano volunteers to join Austin on the march to Béxar. At the end of the month, Dimmitt sent a group of men under Ira Westover to engage the Mexican garrison at Fort Lipantitlán, near San Patricio.  Late on November 3, the Texians took the undermanned fort without firing a shot.  After dismantling the fort, they prepared to return to Goliad.  The remainder of the Mexican garrison, which had been out on patrol, approached. The Mexican troops were accompanied by 15–20 loyal centralists from San Patricio, including all members of the ayuntamiento.  After a thirty-minute skirmish, the Mexican soldiers and Texian centralists retreated. With their departure, the Texian army controlled the Gulf Coast, forcing Mexican commanders to send all communication with the Mexican interior overland.

(CNN) -- Pour yourself a cold martini, make sure it's extra dry, put some classic jazz on the stereo, a mournful saxophone is a must, and settle in with one of the best-reviewed novels of the year, \\"Rules of Civility.\\"  Written by first-time novelist Amor Towles, a principal at a Manhattan investment firm, the book has shot up the best-seller charts and is drawing rave reviews from critics. It's a nostalgic love letter to New York of the late '30s, a novel of manners with lofty aspirations that evokes some of the classics of American literature.  The story unfolds largely in flashback, set on New Year's Eve in Manhattan 1937. The Jazz Age is over, the Depression in its final days, World War II just over the horizon. At its outset, there is a budding love triangle between Katey Kontent, that's \\"kon-tent, like the state of being\\"; her boardinghouse roommate, Eve; and a handsome banker, Theodore \\"Tinker\\" Grey, but an unexpected accident sends the story in a more serious direction.  Katey is the narrator and the wry heart of this novel. She's a young woman of \\"poise and purpose.\\" Brooklyn-born, the daughter of immigrant laborers, she works in a Wall Street secretarial pool though aspires to much more.  Alongside a supporting cast with WASPy nicknames like Dicky, Bitsy and Peaches, Katey navigates her way through Manhattan jazz clubs and Long Island cocktail parties and into the upper echelons of New York society.  The novel takes its title from young George Washington's \\"Rules of Civility & Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation\\"; you'll find all 110 of them in the novel's appendix.

I figured that it's about time I let this one out. Pokémon fans are suffering in America these days. Why? Because we rely on Kids WB and 4Kids Entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies. As far as the series goes, they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the Japanese versions to television. So what is their problem when it comes to the movies? Honestly now, I have seen all three Pokémon movies in Japanese and I will definitely be seeing the fourth one. They are excellent movies. They are all enjoyable and fun to watch. And, after seeing Pokémon 2000 in theaters, I can't help but wonder how these American producers read the Japanese scripts. The way it appears, it seems that they read and see something that says \`Insert empty moral here' in big bold faced letters. It definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on MSB (extreme sarcasm there) and created this crap. *possible spoilers from here on* Well, I guess I should first talk about Pikachu's Rescue Adventure. My first gripe with this came with no narration. I guess they got enough bad comments on the Pokédex narration that plagued Pikachu's Vacation, and, instead of going with a caring, gentle woman's voice as appeared in Pikachu no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai, they just cut the narration all together. This wouldn't have been a problem, except for one thing. Did anyone really understand why the Exeggcute didn't let Togepi go until the end? Possibly the fans, but I'm sure not the parents. Then, there's the theme song. I couldn't help but roll my eyes at this one. The Japanese theme song was \`Tankentai wo Tsukurou' and was sung by Japanese children. It was fun and enjoyable. This one: nauseating. Now, one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing Kireihana. Nice music, fun to watch. That's changed with the Bellossom. The music sucked for one, but on top of that, they had all the Pokémon talk during the music, which turned out to be jumpy, annoying, and just unnecessary. Oh, and then there's the Poliwhirl who thinks he's a Poliwrath. You'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are. Basically, not much could save this little ill fated dub, which is very unfortunate considering its potential. But, I haven't touched on the worst of it yet. You'd think that the warning signs would've been apparent to me when I received my issue of Nintendo Power. For some unfathomable reason, I had been placing some faith in 4Kids and the WB. My thoughts were \`well, they screwed up on the first movie, but the second is different as far as the theme goes, so they should do well.' That in mind, I just didn't pay attention to the warning signs I encountered in the theaters when the trailers said, \`You will believe that one person can make all the difference.' With the way they said that at every turn, I was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like MSB did at the end of the English version. Then comes Nintendo Power, in which I see all my fears realized in the words \`the main feature 'The Power of One.' At that point, I became a bit more uneasy. \`The Power of One?!' Not a good sign. However, I still kept some of my false faith. Big mistake. Sitting in the theater, I was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which I loved in Japanese being turned into complete and utter junk. I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle. I can see a point in that since they didn't pander this thing, repeating it over and over like in MSB. However, it did more damage than anything else in this movie. First of all, the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read \`the world turns to Ash.' Ah hah. So, Ash is the chosen one? Whatever. In the Japanese version, the inhabitants of Arshia needed a Pokémon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony. This time, he's the chosen one. A greater way that this did damage was to Lugia. Lugia was one of the coolest characters in a Pokémon movie.... when the movie was ABOUT Lugia. In this one, Lugia is forced to take a back seat to Ash. In the scene where they're flying back to the main island, Lugia and Ash are discussing the conditions of Lugia's existence, not that Ash is going to make all the difference. Overall in this category, Ash wasn't really the \`one person' that would make the difference, since he was helped by many along the way. A lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking. Furura's flute song wasn't nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the Japanese one. Jirarudan's speech to them saying his collection \`started with a Mew card?' Ugh. Even worse, Misty's outrage originally concerned the way Moltres and Zapdos were being held. \`Why didn't you put them in Pokéballs when you caught them? This is like caging them to be displayed.' Much different from whining about him thinking Pokémon are things to be collected like stamps. If there were any real redeeming values in this, they came from Team Rocket. Some pretty funny lines. Not really to make me laugh out loud, but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach. Well, that was officially the last American Pokémon movie I'm going to see. I've imported the third one and find it very enjoyable. I would rather not see another Japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two. I'll be importing the fourth one as well.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  Vaughan Williams' program note for A Sea Symphony discusses how the text was to be treated as music. The composer writes, \\"The plan of the work is symphonic rather than narrative or dramatic, and this may be held to justify the frequent repetition of important words and phrases which occur in the poem. The words as well as the music are thus treated symphonically.\\" Walt Whitman's poems inspired him to write the symphony, and Whitman's use of free verse became appreciated at a time where fluidity of structure was becoming more attractive than traditional, metrical settings of text. This fluidity helped facilitate the non-narrative, symphonic treatment of text that Vaughan Williams had in mind. In the third movement in particular, the text is loosely descriptive and can be \\"pushed about by the music\\", some lines being repeated, some not consecutive in the written text immediately following one another in the music, and some left out entirely.Vaughan Williams was not the only composer following a non-narrative approach to his text. Mahler took a similar, perhaps even more radical approach in his Eighth Symphony, presenting many lines of the first part, \\"Veni, Creator Spiritus\\", in what music writer and critic Michael Steinberg referred to as \\"an incredibly dense growth of repetitions, combinations, inversions, transpositions and conflations\\". He does the same with Goethe's text in Part Two of the symphony, making two substantial cuts and other changes.Other works take the use of text as music still further. Vaughan Williams uses a chorus of women's voices wordlessly in his Sinfonia Antartica, based on his music for the film Scott of the Antarctic, to help set the bleakness of the overall atmosphere. While a chorus is used in the second and third movements of Glass's Seventh Symphony, also known as A Toltec Symphony, the text contains no actual words; the composer states that it is instead formed \\"from loose syllables that add to the evocative context of the overall orchestral texture\\".

He's smooth, charming, and has never been caught in his professional 'career.' Living a life of luxury, deception, and shady deals, he never planned on making friends or taking an apprentice. One sunny afternoon, Roy crosses paths with Angela, a young, ambitious, and smart woman who has also recently entered the world of cons and scams. However, Angela's wild curiosity puts her on Roy's radar as she bites off more than she can chew by dipping into one of his major cons. Initially, they form a turbulent relationship – Roy is driven by the fear that Angela's mistake might implicate him, while Angela is desperate to prove herself to someone she admires. Roy reluctantly agrees to teach Angela the art of conning, but only under the condition that her involvement in his schemes would remain a secret. As the story unfolds, he teaches her the ropes – the subtle techniques of persuasion, strategies of deception, misdirection, and how to blend in with various crowds. While their partnership grows, so does their unspoken emotional bond as Roy sees himself in young Angela, remembering his own struggles when he was an inexperienced con artist. Their cons escalate, becoming more elaborate and daring. All the while, an honest and relentless detective named Gary Thompson is hot on their trail growing increasingly obsessed with catching Roy, fueled by the challenge Roy's never-ending game of cat and mouse presents. As the story reaches its climax, Angela proposes an ambitious con, targeting the influential and corrupt businessman Maximilian Devereux for a once-in-a-lifetime big score. Despite Roy's reluctance, they both commit to the plan; however, this time, Roy realizes that Detective Thompson is closing in on them. Facing a hard decision, Roy sacrifices his own safety for Angela, who's like family now. Detective Thompson finally arrests Roy, and it appears that their con has failed. But in a thrilling twist, Angela reveals that she has outsmarted Thompson and pulled off the con without detection. Now realizing that Roy has been the master behind their successful cons, Angela decides to honor Roy's teaching by giving her share of the spoils to help those she'd conned. Through Roy's tutelage, Angela not only learns the art of conning but also the importance of empathy and integrity, turning her life around to use her skills for a greater purpose. As the movie ends, Roy, although behind bars, admires Angela's personal growth and takes solace in the difference he made on their journey together. Meanwhile, Angela commits herself to using her newly acquired skills to help the greater good, always remembering the invaluable lessons Roy reluctantly taught her."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mrs. Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London, England. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby and Judy (Christopher Severn and Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) at university. They have live-in staff: Gladys the housemaid (Brenda Forbes) and Ada the cook (Marie De Becker).As World War II looms, Vin comes down from university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreements (mainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruism) they fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal.Several months later, as the war comes closer to home with the bombing of Great Brittan, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot.

In 1992 Ashley, now 21, was born, but with the recent revelations. The couple began to ask how this could happen. They feared that perhaps there was a mix up at the clinic.            Paula, using the genealogy she had acquired, tracked down a cousin of Ashley's biological father, who told her that, Thomas R. Lippert, her cousin, had worked at the very clinic where Paula had been inseminated. \\"I remember that he was at the front desk a lot of the time,\\" recalls Paula who says the couple tried on several occasions to get pregnant, She says Lippert who was a part-time employee of the university from 1988 to 1994, had a stack of baby pictures behind his desk, \\"he seemed friendly and was very proud of all those pictures almost seemed like a brag board up there, those where the children that he had helped people have.\\" says Paula.            Lippert's mother agreed to give a DNA sample and the result confirmed that Lippert was indeed Ashley's father. The question now is how all of this happened, Paula suspects that Lippert for some reason may have switched his sperm sample with her husband's. \\"I just thought, 'oh my gosh,' this was not an accident, this was intentional. All those photos of the babies that he was so proud of I thought, 'oh my god how many of those are his biological children?'\\" says Paula.            This story only gets more stunningly bizarre, as the couple began digging into Lippert's background. They discovered, that prior to coming to work for the clinic, Lippert had served two years in prison for a high profile kidnapping, where he is accused of snatching up a college co-ed and holding her for three weeks and conducting \\"love experiments\\", that included locking her in a black box and using electroshock therapy on her to make her \\"fall in love with him.\\"            The University of Utah is responding to the story and offered 2News the following statement; here it is in its entirety:            \\"Since April 2013, the University of Utah has been investigating credible information regarding the possible mislabeling or tampering of a semen sample at RMTI (Reproductive Medical Technologies, Inc.), a private andrology lab owned by a University faculty member (now deceased). The facility was a private laboratory located in Midvale, Utah. While not owned or operated by the University, the University contracted with RMTI for specimen preparation and semen analysis. Additionally, RMTI prepared semen samples for private physician offices throughout the community, not University physicians.            Through genetic testing, a woman who received artificial insemination (AI) in 1991 discovered the biological father of her child was not her husband, as she had assumed. She traced the genetics of her child to a man who was a former employee of the now-defunct RMTI, which may have prepared the AI sample. The man in question was also a part-time employee of the University from 1988-94.            There are no remaining records from RMTI to prove the claim and the man in question has been deceased since 1997. Consequently, it is unknown how this incident might have happened. In addition, there is no evidence to indicate this situation extends beyond the case in question.            We understand this information has been upsetting for the family and other clients of RMTI.

The University of Utah is offering free genetic testing to families who went to the Midvale, Utah, clinic during the late 1980s and early 1990s in the wake of these jaw-dropping revelations. Now, the family has set up a website for others who believe they might have been victims of a semen-switching plan by the receptionist.      The family discovered the truth about their daughter's parentage thanks to a direct-to-consumer genetic test by 23andMe, according to CeCe Moore, an independent genetic genealogist who first broke the story on her blog. Moore was contacted by \\"Paula,\\" a pseudonym for the mother in the case, in October 2012. Paula and her husband \\"Jeff\\" had used the private clinic Reproductive Medical Technologies, Inc. (RMTI) in Midvale to conceive their daughter \\"Ashley\\" in 1992. Paula and Jeff had not requested donor sperm, and had no reason to believe that Jeff's semen had not been used for the insemination.      But after all three family members had their DNA tested through 23andMe, Paula discovered something shocking: Her daughter and her husband did not share any DNA markers.      DNA shock      Traditional paternity tests confirmed 23andMe's information — no surprise, Moore told LiveScience, as the typical paternity test compares up to 21 genetic markers, while 23andMe's test look at one million. [7 Diseases You Can Learn About from a Genetic Test]      \\"Although it's not legally admissible, it's a much more thorough test,\\" she said. Moore is not employed by 23andMe, though she is a volunteer with the company's Ancestry Ambassadors group, which provides the company feedback on its products. She has also volunteered her expertise on projects for the genetic testing firm Family Tree DNA.      Reeling, the family wondered if the clinic had made a mistake. The truth turned out to be far more distressing.      On Moore's advice, Paula had Ashley tested by two other consumer genetic testing firms, Family Tree DNA and AncestryDNA. With Ashley's DNA profile in those two companies' databases, a match popped up — a first cousin, once removed.      Fortunately, that cousin had information that linked her and Ashley. From about 1986 to 1995, her cousin Thomas Lippert had manned the front desk at RMTI. Lippert is no longer living, but his 99-year-old mother agreed to have her DNA tested. The results confirmed that she is Ashley's grandmother. Lippert, her only child, must have been Ashley's father.      Disturbing history      The family did not get back to LiveScience in time to comment for this article; Moore said they are \\"overwhelmed\\" with media attention in the wake of her blog post. However, she said the news brought them a huge sense of betrayal.      \\"For the mother, it's like being defiled,\\" she said. \\"It's disgusting — somebody tricking you into having their own sperm implanted in your body.\\"      For Ashley's father, \\"it's like a theft,\\" Moore said. And Ashley \\"has to grapple with the fact that this man is part of her biology.\\"      Coming to terms with her biological parentage may be even more difficult given another revelation about Lippert: In 1975, he pled guilty to two counts of conspiring to kidnap after the abduction of a Purdue University student who said Lippert and another man stripped her, forced her into a large black box and threatened her with electric shocks in an effort to brainwash her into loving Lippert. Lippert was sentenced to six years in prison, according to a 2007 article in the alumni magazine of Southwest Minnesota State University, where Lippert was a business professor at the time of the arrest. He apparently served only two of those six years.      The revelations about Lippert have Ashley's family concerned that he fathered other children. If Ashley has biological half-siblings, she would like to be in touch with them, Moore said. The family has set up a website for others who are worried that they were also victims of Lippert.      Ashley \\"has handled this unbelievably well,\\" Moore said.      The search for other victims      In the wake of Ashley's family going public, the University of Utah issued a statement confirming that it has been investigating \\"credible information regarding the possible mislabeling or tampering of a semen sample at RMTI\\" since April 2013. The facility was private, but contracted with the university to prepare and analyze semen samples. [5 Myths About Fertility Treatments]      RMTI is no longer operating, and the university says that there are no records remaining to explain how Lippert ended up fathering Ashley. Individuals wishing to avail themselves of paternity testing can contact the University of Utah Andrology Lab at (801) 587-5852.      Paternity tests are not the only option available to worried families, Moore said. Because Ashley, Ashley's biological grandmother and Lippert's cousin all have their DNA on record in the databases of 23andMe, Family Tree DNA and AncestryDNA, tests by any of those companies would immediately reveal a relationship to Lippert. A university paternity test can only show that the child is not related to his or her father, necessitating a second round of testing if there is no genetic relationship, Moore said.      \\"I'm not saying they shouldn't test through the university, but I think some people might prefer independent private testing,\\" she said.      Though the case brought appalling news to Ashley, Paula and Jeff, Moore said the DNA testing reveals the power of consumer genetics. Lippert's case is not the only example of malfeasance at sperm banks or clinics. In 1992, for example, fertility doctor Cecil Jacobson was convicted on charges of fraud and perjury for scams at his clinic in Virginia in the 1980s. DNA tests showed that Jacobson had fathered at least 15 children with patients told they were getting anonymous donor sperm. With companies like 23andMe on the scene, the DNA evidence proving such cases is no longer in the shadows.      \\"My message to anyone who would think of doing something like this is you will not get away with it,\\" Moore said.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Humans and many other mammals have unusually efficient internal temperature regulating systems that automatically maintain stable core body temperatures in cold winters and warm summers. In addition, people have developed cultural patterns and technologies that help them adjust to extremes of temperature and humidity . In very cold climates, there is a constant danger of developing hypothermia , which is a life threatening drop in core body temperature to below normal levels. The normal temperature for humans is about 37.0degC. However, differences in persons and even the time of day can cause it to be as much as 6degC higher or lower in healthy individuals. It is also normal for core body temperature to be lower in elderly people. Hypothermia begins to occur when the core body temperature drops to 34.4degC. Below 29.4degC, the body cools more rapidly because its natural temperature regulating system usually fails. The rapid decline in core body temperature is likely to result in death. However, there have been rare cases in which people have been saved after their temperatures had dropped to 13.9-15.6degC. This happened in 1999 to a Swedish woman who was trapped under an ice sheet in freezing water for 80 minutes. She was found unconscious, not breathing, and her heart had stopped beating, yet she was eventually saved despite the fact that her temperature had dropped to 13.7degC. In extremely hot climates or as a result of uncontrollable infections, core body temperatures can rise to equally dangerous levels. This is hyperthermia. Life threatening hyperthermia typically starts in humans when their temperatures rise to 40.6-41.7degC. Only a few days at this extraordinarily high temperature level is likely to result in the worsening of internal organs and death. Why can humans keep stable body temperatures in different seasons? A) Because their bodies are unusually efficient. B) Because they experience different climates. C) Because they can adjust to cultural patterns and technologies. D) Because they have internal temperature regulating systems. Answer:","output":"Humans can maintain stable body temperatures in different seasons primarily because of their remarkably efficient internal temperature regulating systems. These systems work automatically to keep the core body temperature constant in diverse climatic conditions, such as cold winters and warm summers. The human body has several mechanisms for temperature regulation, including sweating, shivering, and adjusting blood flow to the skin. For instance, when body temperatures rise due to warm environments or physical activity, the body starts to sweat. The evaporation of sweat cools the skin and lowers the body's core temperature. Conversely, in cold conditions, the body conserves heat by constricting blood vessels near the skin and shivering to generate warmth through muscle activity. In addition to these physiological adaptations, humans have developed cultural patterns and technologies that help them further adjust to various temperature extremes. For instance, they have invented clothing, shelter, and heating and cooling systems to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures. In cold climates, people wear insulating clothing layers to trap warmth and protect their bodies from cold, wind, and moisture. In hot climates, they often wear looser, breathable fabrics to facilitate heat loss and air circulation. Furthermore, people have developed specific food habits, social customs, and work routines that often reflect their adaptation to their environment's thermal characteristics. For example, in hot climates, cultures may adopt siestas, a midday nap or rest, as a means of avoiding the most intense heat. In contrast, in colder climates, people typically engage in more indoor activities and consume high-energy foods to keep their body temperatures stable. However, when extreme temperatures exceed the body's natural ability to regulate its core temperature, there is a risk of developing hypothermia (lowered body temperature) or hyperthermia (increased body temperature) which can be life threatening. In these situations, the body's natural temperature regulating mechanisms are unable to cope with the environmental challenges, and humans must rely on other means to maintain safety and health. To sum up, humans can keep stable body temperatures in different seasons due to their highly efficient internal temperature regulating systems, as well as their ability to adapt to various climates through cultural patterns and technologies. Combined, these factors allow humans to thrive in a wide range of temperature and humidity extremes prevalent across the globe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: I was in Houston a few weeks ago,and needed to be back home in Austin by midmorning the next day.Though I usually left in the evening,for some reason last time I had to choose to set off after midnight. I was on my way back to Austin when I realized I left an important file,and knew I had to return to get it.I took the first exit I could,but when I rounded the corner,an 18-wheeler was stopped dead in the exit lane.I swerved  to avoid it,and then I realized that there was something wrong with my car.So I pulled into a small parking lot and unsurprisingly found the area deserted at 3:15am.I've lived in urban areas most of my life.I'm fairly street-wise and don't become frightened easily,but I knew I was in a pretty tough neighborhood. There was no one in Houston to pick me up.I immediately locked the doors and picked up my phone to call a tow truck.Soon a young man knocked on my driver's side window and asked if he could help me.Judging from his appearance,he was far from a mad man,but I knew he was far more likely to rob than help me.So I lied to him.After a while,he asked again,but this time I politely refused and told him the tow truck was due any minute.He finally said,\\"Madam,you need help.A tow truck in Houston will arrive anywhere between 45minutes and approximately never (which I knew was true),and you aren't going anywhere until you change your flat tire.\\" After considering thoroughly,I got out.He looked surprised,but got right to work.He changed the tire,returned the seat to its place and said,\\"Thank you for letting me help you.You gave me a chance when most people would never open the door to someone like me.Would it be okay if I gave you a hug?\\"When I recovered,I gave him a giant hug.I left with a new tire and a renewed faith in human nature. Question: Why did the author lie to the man and refuse his help in the beginning? - Because she thought the man was playing jokes. - Because she thought the man might be a bad man. - Because she thought the man wanted to get a lift. - Because she thought the man was a mad man. Answer:","output":"Because she thought the man might be a bad man."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is an article: February 5, 2014, 2:17 pm LOS ANGELES — Elton John on Wednesday said that his movie production company had acquired the film rights to “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” and planned to make a feature-length animated musical. First performed on Broadway in 1982, “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,” with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice, is still touring in corners of the globe and has become a staple of school productions. Mr. Webber and Mr. Rice will serve as executive producers of the film adaptation, which is still in the early stages; no potential release date was announced. Mr. John’s production company, Rocket Pictures, was behind the hit animated film “Gnomeo & Juliet,” which took in 193 million worldwide in 2011 and was distributed in the United States by the Walt Disney Company. A sequel, “Gnomeo & Juliet: Sherlock Gnomes” is being developed. Rocket Pictures is currently shooting a biopic of its founder. “Rocketman,” which will be released by Focus Features, although a date has not been set, stars Tom Hardy as the singer. Mr. Webber and Mr. Rice are experienced with film adaptations of their musicals. “Evita,” starring Madonna and Antonio Banderas, took in 209 million worldwide in 1996, after accounting for inflation. A major film version of the Bible-themed “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” has been bandied about for years — particularly after a hit 1993 revival on Broadway starring Donny Osmond — but took on new life last year after the film success of “Les Miserables.” Write a title for it.","output":"Elton John's Production Company Acquires Film Rights to \\"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\\" for Animated Musical Adaptation"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Public Enemy is an American hip hop group consisting of Chuck D, Flavor Flav, Professor Griff, Khari Wynn, DJ Lord, and the S1W group. Founding member DJ Terminator X left the group in 1999. Formed on Long Island, New York, in 1986, they are known for their politically charged music and criticism of the American media, with an active interest in the frustrations and concerns of the African American community. Their first four albums during the late 1980s and early 1990s were all certified either gold or platinum and were, according to music critic Robert Hilburn in 1998, \\"the most acclaimed body of work ever by a hip hop act\\". Carlton Ridenhour (Chuck D) and William Drayton (Flavor Flav) met at Long Island's Adelphi University in the mid-1980s. Developing his talents as an MC with Flav while delivering furniture for his father's business, Chuck D and Spectrum City, as the group was called, released the record \\"Check Out the Radio\\", backed by \\"Lies\\", a social commentary--both of which would influence RUSH Productions' Run-D.M.C. and Beastie Boys. Chuck D put out a tape to promote WBAU (the radio station where he was working at the time) and to fend off a local MC who wanted to battle him. He called the tape Public Enemy #1 because he felt like he was being persecuted by people in the local scene. This was the first reference to the notion of a public enemy in any of Chuck D's songs. The single was created by Chuck D with a contribution by Flavor Flav, though this was before the group Public Enemy was officially assembled. Around 1986, Bill Stephney, the former Program Director at WBAU, was approached by Ali Hafezi and offered a position with the label. Stephney accepted, and his first assignment was to help fledgling producer Rick Rubin sign Chuck D, whose song \\"Public Enemy Number One\\" Rubin had heard from Andre \\"Doctor Dre\\" Brown.  According to the book The History of Rap Music by Cookie Lommel, \\"Stephney thought it was time to mesh the hard-hitting style of Run DMC with politics that addressed black youth. Chuck recruited Spectrum City, which included Hank Shocklee, his brother Keith Shocklee, and Eric \\"Vietnam\\" Sadler, collectively known as the Bomb Squad, to be his production team and added another Spectrum City partner, Professor Griff, to become the group's Minister of Information. With the addition of Flavor Flav and another local mobile DJ named Terminator X, the group Public Enemy was born.\\" According to Chuck, The S1W, which stands for Security of the First World, \\"represents that the black man can be just as intelligent as he is strong. It stands for the fact that we're not third-world people, we're first-world people; we're the original people.\\" Hank Shocklee came up with the name Public Enemy based on \\"underdog love and their developing politics\\" and the idea from Def Jam staffer Bill Stephney following the Howard Beach racial incident, Bernhard Goetz, and the death of Michael Stewart: \\"The Black man is definitely the public enemy.\\"  Public Enemy started out as opening act for the Beastie Boys during the latter's Licensed to Ill popularity, and in 1987 released their debut album Yo! Bum Rush the Show.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Where was the local scene?","output":"The local scene mentioned in the text was in Long Island, New York, where Public Enemy was formed in 1986."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do those questions have the same meaning? Select from:  a). no;  b). yes;","output":"b). yes; Mosquito repellent liquid vaporizers do work to repel mosquitoes, and they are a popular and effective method for controlling mosquitoes in an environment. The vaporizers operate by dispersing a chemical compound called Pyrethroids or Allethrin into the air. These compounds are known as synthetic versions of pyrethrum, a natural insecticide found in chrysanthemum flowers. The chemical works by affecting the mosquito's nervous system, making it less likely to bite and repel it instead. There are several types of mosquito repellent liquid vaporizers available in the market, such as plug-in devices, refillable liquid containers, and all-in-one units. These devices work by using an electrical heating system to heat up the liquid, turning it into vapor. Once heated, the volatile chemical is released into the air, creating a protective barrier that repels mosquitoes within a certain area. However, the effectiveness of mosquito repellent liquid vaporizers may vary due to several factors, such as: 1. Room size: The repellent's effectiveness typically works in an enclosed environment where the concentration of the vapor can be maintained. If the room is too large or has inadequate ventilation, the vapor's concentration may not be strong enough to repel mosquitoes effectively. 2. Type of mosquito: The effectiveness of liquid vaporizers may vary depending on the mosquito species. Some species might be more resistant or less attracted to the chemical compounds used in the repellent. 3. Proper usage: The vaporizer should be placed in an appropriate location and turned on before mosquitoes become active (usually during dusk hours). Ensure that windows and doors are closed, so the vaporized chemical creates a protective barrier. Also, replacing the liquid refill regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions will help maintain optimal performance. 4. Individual factors: Some person's natural body chemistry may make them more attractive to mosquitoes, even when using a repellent vaporizer. In such cases, it might be necessary to combine the vaporizer with other repellent methods such as sprays or creams on the skin. In conclusion, the questions \\"Does mosquito repellent liquid vaporizer actually work?\\" and \\"How do mosquito repellent liquid vaporizers work?\\" have the same meaning, as they both inquire about the functionality and effectiveness of mosquito repellent liquid vaporizers. Mosquito repellent liquid vaporizers can effectively repel mosquitoes when used correctly, although several factors like room size, type of mosquito, proper usage, and individual preferences may impact their efficiency. Nonetheless, they are a widely accepted and popular method to manage and prevent mosquito bites indoors."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

He once said that if he could stand somewhere, he could move the earth with his machine. Hearing that, king of Sicily called Archimedes and his fellow scientist Ptolemy to come up with great inventions. Archimedes, as everyone expected, came up with a great machine. But Ptolemy couldn't do much in such a limited time. So, his device was not a machine.  and a hint : Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force.  Please answer this question : Would Archimedes' device more likely or less likely make work easier than Ptolemy's one? The answer to this question is:","output":"Archimedes' device would more likely make work easier than Ptolemy's one. This is because Archimedes was known for his great inventions of machines that could effectively change the manner in which work was done, either by increasing the force applied, increasing the distance over which the force was applied, or changing the direction in which the force was applied. Since Ptolemy was unable to develop a machine in the given time, his device would likely not have these benefits, making Archimedes' device more effective at making work easier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They are likely part of a larger group, since the requester mentioned \\"a large group of people.\\" Given the wardrobe change and the presence of an audience, this event might be a sports competition, a theatrical performance, or another form of entertainment. When the two men turn to face the camera to speak, they could be preparing to deliver a message to viewers, perhaps introducing themselves and the event that is about to unfold. They may describe the purpose of the event, who they are, and what roles they play within the larger group. The camera might be for a live broadcast or be recording to disseminate the footage later, so the men could also address anyone watching remotely or discuss the significance of the event being recorded. In the context of a sports competition, the two men could be athletes part of a larger team, and the spandex attire suggests they may be participating in sports like gymnastics, swimming, or cycling. They might explain the rules or objectives of the competition, share their thoughts on their opponents or the event's significance, and possibly express gratitude to their supporters, teammates, and coaches. If the event is a theatrical performance, the spandex clothing and robes may be costumes the two men will wear during the show.

This statement clearly indicates that Carrie is the sick person and Lindsey is trying to help her by recommending a remedy for her cough. Hence, the correct option to pick from the given choices is (I). Carrie is the sick person. In this scenario, Carrie seems to be suffering from a bad cough, which may be a symptom of a cold, flu, or other respiratory illness. These conditions can be quite uncomfortable and disruptive, making it essential for Carrie to find relief as soon as possible. Lindsey, as a compassionate and caring friend, steps in to suggest the use of an over-the-counter medication, Nyquil. Nyquil is a popular remedy for cold and flu symptoms, making it a suitable recommendation in this instance. It contains various active ingredients, such as acetaminophen, dextromethorphan, and doxylamine succinate, which work together to help reduce symptoms such as fever, cough, and runny nose. By recommending Nyquil, Lindsey is expressing concern for Carrie's health and well-being, as she hopes that it will effectively alleviate her friend's cough and associated discomfort. This shows that Lindsey is empathetic and supportive, traits that are essential in helping someone who is not feeling well. In contrast, (II) Lindsey is the sick person is not the correct option in this case, as the sentence explicitly states that Carrie is the one suffering from the bad cough. Were Lindsey to be the sick person, the sentence would need to be rewritten to indicate her situation accurately. However, no such alteration is required as the original sentence is coherent and properly reflects the roles of both characters.

Rand Paul, one of the most vocal GOP opponents of voting on a repeal bill before coming up with a replacement package, voted against the budget resolution and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein was absent.      Senators were bleary-eyed as they walked quickly to the exits, wrapping up the final vote a little before 1:30 a.m. ET.      Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the top Democrat who led the late-night fight against a repeal, said the protest could be a sign of things to come as the fight stretches on.      \\"I think it's important for this country to know this was not a usual thing, this is a day which lays the groundwork for 30 million people to be thrown off their health insurance,\\" Sanders said. \\"And if that happens, many of these people will die.\\"      JUST WATCHED How Sanders plans to deal with Obamacare Replay More Videos ...

Chuck Schumer.      Democratic senators registered a somewhat subtle, but significant protest in the Senate as they cast their votes -- declaring why they were voting against the repeal, a rare move that rankled Republicans in the chamber.      The House is expected take a swift vote on the resolution, possibly as early as Friday, which will trigger congressional committees to begin crafting a second bill that would roll back major parts of Obamacare. Though it will be weeks before Congress votes on that bill, Thursday still marked a victory for the Republican Party as it moves toward overhauling the country's healthcare system.      President-elect Donald Trump congratulated the Senate for its actions Thursday.      \\"Congrats to the Senate for taking the first step to #RepealObamacare- now it's onto the House!\\" he tweeted.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2017      \\"Vote-a-rama\\"      Before Thursday's vote, a political spectacle known as \\"vote-a-rama\\" unfolded on the Senate floor.      The largely symbolic exercise -- which began Wednesday evening and stretched into wee hours of Thursday -- was ripe for theater. However, the tone was largely subdued, missing some of the fire of voting marathons in previous years.      Democrats still used the late-night drill to publicly defend the Affordable Care Act and chastise their colleagues across the aisle for starting the process of overhauling a law that gives health insurance to some 20 million Americans. Republicans, meanwhile, stressed the harmful impact of the law and the urgent need to do away with it.      Senators introduced more than 160 amendments to the budget resolution, which led to a marathon session of impassioned speeches and roll call votes. Although these votes were non-binding and the budget resolution doesn't require the president's signature, the process helped crystallize the Democratic Party's top priorities as it looks to defend the major pillars of Obamacare.      JUST WATCHED Years of President Obama defending Obamacare Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Years of President Obama defending Obamacare 02:00      The most important amendments for Democrats were aimed at preserving what they argue are popular provisions of Obamacare.      Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin pressed a measure to allow young adults to stay on their parents insurance until age 26. \\"It will block Republican efforts that would weaken dependent coverage,\\" Baldwin said in a brief but forceful floor speech before the vote.      But Republicans -- many of whom have expressed interest in maintaining the provision when they eventually replace Obamacare -- nevertheless blocked the Baldwin amendment, arguing it wasn't applicable to the underlying budget resolution.      Democrats also sought to protect measures dealing with pre-existing conditions and reproductive healthcare services for women.      Divided but some common ground      At times, the evening also showed that Republicans and Democrats share some common goals -- even if the two political parties are bitterly divided on the merits of Obamacare.      Earlier in the night, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat who has called on Republicans to work in a bipartisan fashion on repealing and replacing Obamacare, emphasized the importance of preserving coverage for patients in rural areas.      No matter what happens to Obamacare, Manchin said: \\"We are going to make sure that we protect our rural hospitals and rural clinics.\\"      But on the same topic, Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming argued that it was because of Obamacare that rural hospitals have shuttered.      \\"For people in small towns -- the closures that we've already experienced, these closures have had a devastating impact,\\" Barrasso said.      Trump has ratcheted up the pressure this week, calling on his party to act as quickly as possible. Perhaps more significantly, Trump is adamant that Republicans vote on repealing and replacing Obamacare more or less at the same time. This is a significant divergence from the party's initial thinking that it would first vote on repeal before considering replacement options.      Trump's plan      In a news conference in Wednesday, Trump told reporters that a plan will be unveiled soon after his nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, Tom Price, is confirmed. A Georgia congressman, Price is an ardent Obamacare critic and has previously introduced detailed legislation to repeal and replace the law.

Even as Republicans advanced the plan to roll back Obamacare, plans to replace were still being formulated. To that end, a small group of relatively moderate Republican senators -- including Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski -- initially pushed a change that would give senators until March to develop a plan to replace Obamacare. But the senators dropped that push as it became clear Wednesday that Republican leaders were moving toward replacing Obamacare as they repeal it.      Vice President-elect Mike Pence met with senators at the Capitol Wednesday. As he exited his meeting with Pence, Manchin said that the incoming VP promised a draft replacement for Obamacare would be available in 30-60 days.      Republicans on the Hill do not yet have a plan for replacing Obamacare, and are considering a series of possible legislative paths to replace what they vote to repeal.      It's also not clear that one comprehensive \\"replacement\\" bill will ultimately emerge from GOP lawmakers -- in fact, senior leaders are currently weighing the option of incremental replacement bills.      For example, they are exploring whether replacement measures could be inserted into the \\"repeal\\" reconciliation bill, which Republicans hope to vote on by late February or March. Leaders are also looking into whether any replacement or healthcare reform measures could be inserted into reauthorization bills that Congress is expected to take up later this year. ||||| On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he would offer his own plan to repeal and replace the law “essentially simultaneously.” He said he would put forth the plan as soon as his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, is confirmed.      The Affordable Care Act has become ingrained in the American health care system, and unwinding it will be a formidable challenge for Republicans. More than 20 million people have gained coverage under the law, though premiums have risen sharply in many states and some insurers have fled the law’s health exchanges.      The budget blueprint instructs House and Senate committees to come up with repeal legislation by Jan. 27.      Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, and four other Republicans had sought to extend that deadline by five weeks, to March 3. But late Wednesday night, Mr. Corker withdrew an amendment that would have changed the date.      “We understand that everyone here understands the importance of doing it right,” he said. He described the Jan. 27 date in the budget blueprint as a placeholder.      Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, another Republican who sought to delay the deadline, said: “This date is not a date that is set in stone. In fact, it is the earliest we could do it. But it could take longer, and we believe that it might.”      The House was planning to take up the budget blueprint once the Senate approved it, though some House Republicans have expressed discomfort with voting on the blueprint this week because of lingering questions over how and when the health care law would be replaced. ||||| Trump’s Obamacare impatience challenges GOP A quick repeal and replace of Obamacare on the scale the president-elect outlined is complex and arduous.      Donald Trump on Wednesday called for a quick and nearly simultaneous repeal and replacement of Obamacare — a task that's technically almost impossible.      Republicans can repeal much of the law on a party line vote under fast-track budget rules. But replacement require at least a handful of Senate Democrats to help dismantle President Barack Obama's historic achievement that's covering 20 million Americans. And the Republicans have to agree among themselves on a specific detailed bill, an agreement that has so far been elusive.      Story Continued Below      Republican leadership aides were quick to say after Trump's news conference that they're all on the same page, even though they had earlier planned for a swift vote on repeal (although delayed until sometime in the future) and then an extended debate over the replacement.      But a quick repeal and replace of Obamacare on the scale the president-elect outlined is complex and arduous — and politically rife for accusations that Republicans are recklessly repealing a law with scant time for debate.      On top of that, Trump indicated that his administration would introduce its own health care plan — which could either speed up the process of coalescing around a bill or drive a wedge between the Hill and the new White House. Trump didn't spell out what his plan would include.      “We're going to be submitting as soon as our secretary is approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan,” Trump said in his first press conference since July. “It will be repeal and replace. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably the same day. Could be the same hour.”      His chosen HHS secretary, Rep. Tom Price, hasn't had his confirmation hearing yet. The Senate Finance Committee hasn't even scheduled it. Price testifies before the Senate HELP committee next Wednesday, but Finance is the one that votes on the nomination.      The GOP currently has several different health bills and plans, and though they have some common features, lawmakers have not yet rallied around one. It's possible that Trump's proposal could be the impetus for the GOP to coalesce, said a lawmaker who didn’t want to be named. But it's not a guarantee.      Price himself is the author of one of the more detailed proposals on the Hill. It's a conservative, market-oriented plan unlikely to win over Democrats.      “Our new secretary of HHS has had a plan in his pocket now for the last three years,\\" said Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), who is acting as a liaison between Trump and the Hill. \\"If they did present an actual specific plan, that would be a much easier starting point than taking six plans or no plan and trying to start with that. … I think that would speed the process up incredibly.”      “Everyone wants to say the Republicans don’t have a plan,” said Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.) “The problem is we have too many plans, and we’ve got to coalesce around one, and we’re going to.”      Trump hasn't given details of his vision for a new health law, but he has stressed such ideas as allowing people to buy insurance across state lines. He didn't say — and wasn't asked — at the news conference how long it should take to transition from Obamacare to the new plan. Many Hill Republicans have called for a two- or three-year transition.      If Republicans pursue the simultaneous repeal and replace plan, a repeal vote is unlikely to happen for at least several weeks — later than Republicans outlined as recently as a few weeks ago.      The idea of a Trump health care plan took some Republican lawmakers by surprise.      “I would welcome a plan from anybody,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). “I would consider any plan.”      John Cornyn (R-Texas), the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, suggested that the Hill is talking with Trump officials on the idea.      “There is already consultation with the incoming administration,” he said, calling for quick confirmation of Price “so we can interact officially. Right now, given the confirmation process, its more back channel.”      Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is skeptical that even Trump can move legislation quite as fast as he wants.      “He needs to call [Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell,” he said with a laugh when asked if Trump’s timeline is plausible. ||||| The Senate took a first step toward repealing ObamaCare and fulfilling a long-time campaign pledge in the early morning hours Thursday.      Senators voted 51-48 to pass a budget resolution that is being used as a vehicle for rolling back the Affordable Care Act, with the House expected to vote on Friday.      Meanwhile, Paul said in a statement after the vote that while he supports nixing ObamaCare, \\"putting nearly 10 trillion more in debt on the American people’s backs through a budget that never balances is not the way to get there.\\"      \\"Up to 30 million Americans will lose their healthcare, with many thousands dying as a result,\\" he said. \\"Because when you have no health insurance and you can't go to a doctor or a hospital, you die.\\"      Instead, Democrats rose one by one from their seats on the Senate floor in protest to state why they were voting against the resolution.      Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) voted against the budget resolution because it didn’t balance, while no Democrat supported the repeal rules.      Republicans needed a simple majority of votes to clear the repeal rules, instructing committees to begin drafting repeal legislation, through the upper chamber, with the vote falling largely along party lines.      Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who had surgery to install a pacemaker, missed the \\"vote-a-rama\\" session that began Wednesday evening.      Lawmakers were able to use the hourslong voting debate to force a vote on any amendment to the budget resolution. Some 180 amendments were filed.      The late-night passage of the budget resolution comes despite deep divisions on when and how to replace ObamaCare, which were on full display. Lawmakers spent more than six hours on the Senate floor and voted on more than 19 amendments, none of which were successfully added to the resolution.      But Republicans managed to avoid what was expected to be the top fight of the night, when a group of five GOP senators dropped their push to delay the ObamaCare repeal legislation.      Lawmakers had wanted to push the deadline for committee repeal proposals from Jan. 27 to March, which they argued was needed to give lawmakers extra time to lock down details on a replacement bill and work with the incoming Trump administration about next steps.      Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), one of the Republicans backing the amendment, said the decision was a result of a \\"very thoughtful discussions\\" within Republicans and recognizing that the Jan. 27 date is a \\"placeholder.\\"      Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) added that \\"we have assurances from leadership that this date is not a date that is set in stone.\\"      But Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn John CornynSenate agrees to last-ditch talks, but no clear path over shutdown House-passed stopgap measure in Senate limbo The Hill's 12:30 Report — Latest as shutdown looms | Trump says Dems to blame | Senate GOP rejects calls to go 'nuclear' | Ginsburg undergoes lung surgery MORE (R-Texas) had warned that pushing back the date could create a \\"jam\\" on the Senate floor with GOP lawmakers wanting to tackle an ambitious agenda in President-elect Donald Trump Donald John TrumpSchumer, Pelosi: Trump got 'what he wanted' with shutdown Trump has discussed firing Fed chief after latest interest rate hike: report LeBron James accuses NFL team owners of being 'old white men' with 'slave mentality' MORE's first 100 days.      Republicans are also facing larger divisions among GOP members and the incoming Trump administration on when to replace ObamaCare.      Trump said during a press conference on Wednesday that repeal and replace legislation would occur near simultaneously if not at the same time.      “It'll be repeal and replace. It will be essentially, simultaneously. It will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour,” he said.      But Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) — who was mocked by Trump during his press conference — told reporters that the president-elect “needs to call [Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell because that's not where we're headed.”      McConnell (R-Ky.) has repeatedly sidestepped being tied down on the details of repealing and replacing ObamaCare and didn't take a position on the GOP amendment earlier this week.      He said Wednesday that after Senate passage they can send the budget resolution \\"to the House and begin taking the next steps to finally move away from ObamaCare while we move ahead with smarter healthcare policies.\\"      Most of Wednesday night’s action came from Democrats, who used the vote-a-rama to take votes on healthcare and entitlement programs, forcing Republicans to go on the record on a number of key issues.      Democrats are warning that if Republicans break ObamaCare, they will own any political backlash and roil the insurance market.      Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) appealed to Republicans earlier Wednesday, urging them to back down from the healthcare fight.      \\"If Republicans go forward with this plan, they may mollify their base, but they will ostracize and hurt the American people, and ultimately lose in the court of public opinion,\\" he said.      Democrats forced votes on a myriad of non-binding amendments aimed at blocking legislation that would \\"make America sick again,\\" a new Democratic slogan on the GOP plan to repeal ObamaCare without a replacement.      One, from Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), would have made it harder to pass legislation that would “make young people sick again” and allow young adults to stay on their parents' healthcare coverage until they turn 26, one of the more popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act.      Another, from Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), would have cracked down on legislation that would make \\"women sick again\\" by decreasing access to preventative healthcare, birth control and maternity care.      But Republicans defeated each of the amendments. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) broke ranks from her party and supported Baldwin's amendment.      The Senate also defeated a pair of competing amendments on importing prescription drugs.      Sanders tried to use Trump to win over Republicans for his amendment to allow drugs to be imported from Canada.      \\"Let's be clear about it today: Mr. Trump, a guy I don't quote very often, has said that pharma gets away with murder. That's what Trump said. He is right,\\" Sanders said ahead of the votes on the amendments. \\"The time has come for us to stand up to the drug companies.\\"      But ultimately 13 Democrats voted against the Sanders proposal, while 12 Republicans voted for it.      It wasn't all business as senators powered through the more than six-hour session.      Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) also tweeted out observations from the Senate floor throughout the session, including comparing discussion between lawmakers as \\"ailment one upsmanship.\\" |||||","output":"US Senate Republicans initiated the process of repealing and replacing President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare law early Thursday morning, approving the budget blueprint, dubbed the \\"repeal resolution\\".

Read this: Edwin Chadwick's 1829 article, \\"Preventive police\\" in the London Review, argued that prevention ought to be the primary concern of a police body, which was not the case in practice. The reason, argued Chadwick, was that \\"A preventive police would act more immediately by placing difficulties in obtaining the objects of temptation.\\" In contrast to a deterrent of punishment, a preventive police force would deter criminality by making crime cost-ineffective - \\"crime doesn't pay\\". In the second draft of his 1829 Police Act, the \\"object\\" of the new Metropolitan Police, was changed by Robert Peel to the \\"principal object,\\" which was the \\"prevention of crime.\\" Later historians would attribute the perception of England's \\"appearance of orderliness and love of public order\\" to the preventive principle entrenched in Peel's police system.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: In what year was forty-seven clubs, brothels, and other vice establishments reportedly closed in Galveston?  During the 1950s more dangerous criminal elements took advantage of Galveston's lax law enforcement and the absence of the Maceo brothers' influence. Non-vice crime increased in the city. The New Orleans crime syndicate, headed by Carlos Marcello, ran guns to Cuba through the island. Fugitives such as suspected JFK plotter David Ferrie used Galveston as a safe haven.By the 1950s gambling and prostitution were being actively repressed in most parts of Texas. In 1953, the police commissioner, Walter L. Johnston, under pressure from local citizens groups concerned about moral decline and high rates of venereal disease, shut down the red-light district. However, the mayoral victory of George Roy Clough, a supporter of regulated vice, led to the district's being re-established in 1955. That year Galveston was labeled by national anti-prostitution groups as the \\"worst spot in the nation as far as prostitution is concerned\\".Paul Hopkins won the 1956 election for sheriff and set about shutting down the island's illegal activities once and for all. One of the first successful busts of the gambling industry was an undercover operation by Texas Ranger Clint Peoples at the Balinese Room. In 1957 State Attorney General Will Wilson and Department of Public Safety head Homer Garrison (with help from former FBI special agent Jim Simpson) began a massive campaign of raids that wrecked the gambling and prostitution industry on the island, along with liquor imports. Forty-seven clubs, brothels, and other vice establishments were reportedly closed, and 2,000 slot machines were destroyed.  Though officials said they destroyed all of the city's gaming equipment, some locals including R.S. Maceo, nephew of Sam and Rose, claimed that most of the equipment was shipped to Las Vegas before authorities ever discovered it.

What is the name of the engagement on the northern coast of France on 19 August 1942 in which the HMS \\"Calpe\\" participated? Answer:","output":"The engagement on the northern coast of France on 19 August 1942 in which the HMS \\"Calpe\\" participated is known as the Dieppe Raid, also referred to as Operation Jubilee. This military operation was an Allied attack during World War II, primarily involving forces from the United Kingdom and Canada, with additional support from the United States, Free France, and other Allied countries. The main objective of the Dieppe Raid was to assess the feasibility of a large-scale amphibious assault against the heavily fortified German-occupied territories in Europe and to gather crucial intelligence on German defenses. Furthermore, it aimed to boost the morale of the Allied forces by securing a swift victory on a critical European front. The HMS \\"Calpe\\" (L71), a British naval vessel, played a key role in this operation as one of the escort ships for the Allied forces during the raid. The ship, a Hunt-class destroyer escort, was responsible for safeguarding the landing crafts as they approached the shores of Dieppe and providing vital artillery support for the troops as they faced a fierce battle against the defending German forces. Unfortunately, the Dieppe Raid was considered a disastrous failure for the Allies, resulting in heavy casualties, the loss of many ships, and limited success in achieving its strategic goals. Of the nearly 6,000 Allied troops who participated in the operation, more than 3,600 were killed, wounded, or captured. The high casualty rate raised questions about the feasibility of future large-scale amphibious assaults, leading to significant changes in military tactics and the development of new equipment and strategies for the D-Day landings in 1944. In conclusion, the name of the engagement in which the HMS \\"Calpe\\" participated on the northern coast of France on 19 August 1942 is the Dieppe Raid or Operation Jubilee, an ill-fated amphibious assault on German-occupied territory that would later shape future Allied military strategies in World War II."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To check the capacity of the Ivorian Air Force, one would need to consider several factors, including the number and types of aircraft, personnel, and related resources available to the military branch. This assessment could be both quantitative and qualitative in nature. 1. Number and Types of Aircraft: Analyzing the Ivorian Air Force's capacity involves examining its fleet of aircraft for various missions, including combat, transport, and reconnaissance roles. This would require looking at fighter jets, transport planes, helicopters, and other aircraft types to understand the air force's capabilities and limitations. 2. Personnel: An evaluation of the air force's human resources is also an essential aspect of checking its capacity. This includes considering the training, skills, and experience of the pilots, maintenance crews, and support personnel. Understanding their level of expertise and efficiency can offer a clear indication of the overall effectiveness and readiness of the air force. 3. Budget and Resources: Assessing the financial resources and budget allocations for the Ivorian Air Force is also a crucial factor when checking its capacity. This would involve examining the defense budget, procurement plans, and other financial aspects to determine if the air force is well-funded, equipped, and maintained to carry out its mission effectively. 4. Infrastructure: A thorough evaluation of the Ivorian Air Force's capacity should also consider its infrastructure, including air bases, maintenance facilities, and communication systems. This includes ensuring that these facilities are well-maintained, secure, and strategically located to support efficient operations. 5. Joint Operations and Interoperability: Reviewing the Ivorian Air Force's ability to work with other branches of the military or partner nations during joint operations is essential for assessing its capacity. This involves examining the level of cooperation, communication, and interoperability that exists between the air force and other military forces to determine its operational effectiveness. 6. Technological Advancements: Assessing the technologies and equipment utilized by the Ivorian Air Force can help provide an accurate picture of its current capacity. This can include radar systems, electronic warfare capabilities, and modern communication tools that are essential for carrying out various air force missions effectively. Ultimately, checking the capacity of the Ivorian Air Force requires a comprehensive evaluation of multiple factors that contribute to its overall effectiveness and readiness. By examining these various aspects, one can gain a clear insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the air force and identify areas for improvement, ensuring that the Ivorian Air Force remains a competent and capable force in the region."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. It was the first time that she and a new contact had met in person. Ms Nuttall, a UK motivational speaker, says the man gave no explanation for turning up half an hour late at a London restaurant, and then proceeded to talk purely about himself. To add insult to injury, she says he then told her that she wasn't qualified to run her own business. And all this while he ordered the most expensive main course, and told Ms Nuttall that she'd have to foot the entire bill. \\"It was the worst,\\" says Ms Nuttall, 42. First things first, a business lunch isn't going out for a bite to eat with your mates from the office - that's socialising with colleagues. It is instead a business meeting, usually in a restaurant, and typically with someone from another organisation, or at least someone who doesn't work in your team. And the conversation will include business matters - be it talk about a sale, agreement or understanding that benefits both parties. You might think that going for a business lunch is a simple thing, but it is in fact beset with a whole menu of potential perils and pratfalls. From the choice of venue, to what food you pick, whether you order alcohol, and how you share the bill, any number of things can go wrong. Talking politics and religion is almost always a complete no-no, but what if an innocent chat about current affairs quickly turns to President Trump, Brexit or Scottish independence? We asked some etiquette experts and business coaches to guide us through the minefield. The first issue for someone organising a business lunch is the choice of restaurant. \\"You need to find somewhere with a careful balance of ambience,\\" says Jenny Flintoft, a leadership consultant based in the north of England. \\"I tend to favour a restaurant that is buzzy enough that conversations can be had without being overheard in a deathly quiet restaurant, but not one that has lots of background music, as the voice raising makes having a meaningful conversation very difficult.\\" Ms Flintoft also notes the importance of choosing the right dishes. \\"I personally steer clear of corn on the cob, as it can easily get stuck in teeth,\\" she says. \\"[I would also avoid] spaghetti or foods with sloppy sauces, or anything that requires a lot of effort to eat, such as shellfish. \\"During a business luncheon I want to concentrate on my fellow diner, not battling with the meal.\\" You also need to bear in mind the ethical or religious food rules that the other person may follow. For example, ordering the foie gras followed by the veal might not be a great idea, and booking a restaurant that specialises in suckling pig could cause offence. When you have reserved a table in a hopefully appropriate restaurant, one of the biggest questions that lunchtime is - to drink, or not to drink? British etiquette expert Jo Bryant says that alcohol is best avoided because the social atmosphere of a restaurant \\"can easily let us forget that the lunch is for business purposes\\". She continues: \\"Add in a glass or two and you might be at risk of relaxing too much, and saying or agreeing to do something you might regret. \\"It is important to stay sharp and maintain your professional gloss.\\" However, London-based business coach Phil Jones suggests a middle ground when it comes to the wine list. \\"Allow the other person to take the lead,\\" he says. \\"Sometimes it is a loosening of the collar. \\"It's a chance to get some deeper issues, to speak a bit freer.\\" Even without alcohol, conversations over a business lunch can all too easily go awry. Ms Flintoft says: \\"Some people launch very quickly into diatribes about a particular hot [political] potato, and there's a lot of those around at the moment, which makes me question their judgement. \\"But there needs to be a good mix of genuine conversation versus pitching.\\" Ms Nuttall says there should be a number of \\"no-fly\\" discussions. \\"There should be absolutely no talking about sex, politics, religion, bad talking other people or companies, or negatives about your own company or theirs.\\" Mr Jones says people should also guard against venting any personal problems they might be struggling with. \\"One man's wife was having an affair, and I was the first person he'd confided in,\\" he says. \\"I was given the role of therapist by someone who was a complete stranger to me.\\" Wherever the lunch, and whatever the topic, William Hanson, a UK etiquette coach advises being mindful of the other person's time. \\"The worst ones are where they drag on and your host thinks you don't have anywhere else to be,\\" he says. When it comes to picking up the tab at the end of the meal Mr Hanson has a simple rule. \\"Whoever extended the invitation, and has made the reservation, pays,\\" he says. To avoid any awkwardness or uncertainty when the bill arrives, Mr Hanson suggests that the inviter goes one stage further, and gives his or her credit card details to the restaurant ahead of the meal. \\"It takes away the nasty money dilemma at the end,\\" he says. Mr Hanson takes a more relaxed approach though if a lunch with a particular client or associate becomes a regular event. Under such circumstances he says that a \\"turn-taking arrangement can often be struck\\". Ms Nuttall adds that she often thinks that if one of the parties has travelled a long distance, they should be treated to lunch. But normally she suggests that the bill should generally be split equally.

Karen studied animals in school. She started studying predators for a school presentation. She liked it. Her friend Molly liked cows, sheep and other herbivores, so she decided to do a presentation about grazers, and their role in nature.  Hint: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. The answer to this question is:","output":"Karen learned more about wolves. This is because Karen studied animals in school, and chose to focus on predators for her school presentation. The paragraph mentions that predators, such as wolves, play an important role in an ecosystem and can be considered keystone species that can have a significant effect on the balance of organisms. Since Karen was studying predators, it is likely that she learned about wolves as part of her research.

His pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page, echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lantern's struggling glow. The only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds, casting its bone-pale glow onto the pine floorboards. Allan unfolded another page, this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right. The lines of letters stepped into their divisions, in the shape of a story's outline: the loose, dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet, awaiting tendons, muscle and blushing skin.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The plastic identification ( ID, ) cards carded by all Chinese citizens over 16 are to be replaced with electronic cards from 2005.  The new cards, which most people will have by 2005, contain a microchip   on which personal information is stored. This can be checked against databases   kept by the government. \\"The information will be locked into the card so that people won' t be able to use false identities,\\" said Ren Tianbu, a security   official in Shenyang. China's present plastic identity cards were introduced 17 years ago, and a similar system is used by many other countries. However, the information shown on a card differs from nation to nation. Most ID cards show the holder' s name, sex, date of birth and photograph, as well as the card' s expiry   date and number. Germany,  France and Spain all use ID cards, but there are some developed nations who dislike the idea. The US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and Britain are among those with no national ID card. However, some of the countries have ID cards for particular uses.

Diamond Dog discovers Billy Bedlam's corpse and Poe's possessions. Answer:","output":"Title: The Unraveling of Poe Genre: Mystery/Thriller Plot: Act I The movie starts off in a small coastal town in Louisiana, where residents are preparing for their annual culture and arts festival, \\"Bayou Fest.\\" Among the crowd is our protagonist, Edgar \\"Poe\\" Corday, an enigmatic yet charming literature professor who has recently joined the local college. Poe seems to fit in with the community, and everyone is excited about having him attend the event. Poe befriends another newcomer to town, Diamond Dog, who is a freelance journalist looking for a breakthrough story to elevate their career. During the festival, a mysterious character named Billy Bedlam appears, an art collector from out of town, who seems to have a vested interest in the event and its participants. Act II Poe and Billy Bedlam quickly develop a rivalry during the festival, as each tries to outdo the other in various competitions and challenges. Fans of the two become divided, and the event turns into a showdown between them. As their competition begins to disrupt the festival, the town's council decides to organize a final test to determine the true winner. Meanwhile, Diamond Dog starts investigating Poe and Billy's intense rivalry, having a hunch that there might be more to the story than it appears. Diamond Dog begins to uncover a trail of international art thefts, some of which are linked to the small town's cultural heritage. As they delve deeper, they find out that Billy Bedlam is likely to be the mastermind behind these art thefts. Act III One evening, Diamond Dog sneaks into Billy Bedlam's room to gather more evidence. In the process, they discover Billy's corpse and some of Poe's possessions lying close by. This discovery raises suspicions about Poe's true identity and intentions. Conflicted by their feelings toward Poe, Diamond Dog hesitates to report the findings to the police but finally decides to confront Poe directly. Poe, seemingly cornered, reveals a shocking truth: he is an undercover FBI agent, assigned to the case to infiltrate the art theft ring and expose its culprits. He explains that one of Billy's henchmen had stolen his possessions and planted them next to Billy's corpse to frame him. Oblivious to Poe's true identity, the accomplice intended this to merely seem like an act of revenge during their rivalry. Act IV With Diamond Dog now on his side, Poe takes down the art theft ring, which reaches far beyond Louisiana. Their combined skills expose the members involved in the illegal trade, leading to the arrest of most key suspects. Poe's true identity becomes public knowledge, and the townspeople of Louisiana are grateful for his actions in saving their cultural heritage. In the end, life at the small coastal town in Louisiana returns to normal. Poe remains a professor at the local college, although he is now revered as a local hero. Diamond Dog's career takes off as they gain recognition for their investigative journalism skills. \\"The Unraveling of Poe\\" is a thrilling tale of intrigue, deception, and self-discovery, with an unexpected twist revealing the true identity and intentions of our protagonist, Poe."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information:  - Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is the local government council for \\"Na h-Eileanan Siar\\" council area of Scotland, comprising the Outer Hebrides.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - The Sea of the Hebrides is a portion of the North Atlantic Ocean, located off the coast of western Scotland, separating the mainland and the northern Inner Hebrides islands (to the east) from the southern Outer Hebrides islands (to the west). To the north, the Sea of the Hebrides joins The Minch.  - Skye, or the Isle of Skye (or \\"Eilean a' Cheò\\"), is the largest and northernmost of the major islands in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. The island's peninsulas radiate from a mountainous centre dominated by the Cuillins, the rocky slopes of which provide some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in the country. Although it has been suggested that the Gaelic \\"Sgitheanach\\" describes a winged shape there is no definitive agreement as to the name's origins.  - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times.  - The Cuillin (Scottish Gaelic: An Cuilthionn or An Cuiltheann) is a range of rocky mountains located on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. The true Cuillin is also known as the Black Cuillin to distinguish it from the Red Cuilin (na Beanntan Dearga, known locally as Red Hills) across Glen Sligachan. The Red Cuilin hills are lower and, being less rocky, have fewer scrambles or climbs.  - The Outer Hebrides, also known as the Western Isles (Scottish Gaelic: ' or ' ), \\"Innse Gall\\" (\\"islands of the strangers\\") or the Long Isle or Long Island (Gaelic: \\"An t-Eilean Fada\\"), is an island chain off the west coast of mainland Scotland. The islands are geographically coextensive with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, one of the 32 unitary council areas of Scotland. They form part of the Hebrides, separated from the Scottish mainland and from the Inner Hebrides by the waters of the Minch, the Little Minch and the Sea of the Hebrides. Scottish Gaelic is the predominant spoken language, although in a few areas English speakers form a majority.  - Scalpay ( Scottish Gaelic : Sgalpaigh or Sgalpaigh na Hearadh i.e. \`\` Scalpay of Harris '' to distinguish it from Scalpay off Skye ) is an island in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland .  - The Inner Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Na h-Eileanan a-staigh\\", \\"the inner isles\\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than . The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile).

Reduced rainfall would have a direct effect on the amount of water that reaches the limestone rocks, which in turn would have a subsequent impact on the formation of solution caves. With less water available, the process of carbon dioxide absorption by the rainwater would still occur, but there would be a lower volume of weak carbonic acid solution formed as a result.  Lower volume of weak carbonic acid solution would affect the dissolution of calcite, thus resulting in fewer solution cavities and passageway excavations. Ultimately, this would impact the removal of salt from the water as the lack of water would limit the process of dissolving the calcite to a smaller extent than what would normally occur. To summarize, the reduced water availability would have an indirect impact on the process of solution cave formation and salt removal, as it alters the efficiency of the dissolution process which is responsible for the overall outcome. The presence of less water in the process does not directly change the chemical reactions occurring, but it does alter their effectiveness and the scale at which they take place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Global Trends 2014, a survey of more than 16,000 people in 20 countries, also revealed how divided Americans are over the cause and treatment of global warming. When asked if climate change is largely man-made, just 54 percent of US respondents agreed - ranking last in the international poll and ten points lower. than the next lowest countries on the list, Britain and Australia. However in China, 93 per cent of respondents believe the climate change we are witnessing is largely the result of human activity. Skeptics: When asked if climate change is mainly man-made, just 54 percent of US respondents agreed - ranking them last in the poll of countries including Russia, Poland and India. Disbelief: Just 57.3 percent of American respondents believe that we are headed for environmental disaster if we don't change our behavior or habits. The survey, conducted by British market research company Ipsos MORI, also found just 57.3 percent of Americans agreed that we're heading for environmental disaster unless we change our habits quickly. This compares with 91.1 percent of Chinese and 84.2 percent of Italian respondents, who accept that behavioral and attitudinal change is needed to stem the effects of global warming. Half of American interviewees believe the government is using climate change as a way to raise taxes, a view that is shared by the majority of respondents in nearly all the countries polled. However, there appears to be global consensus on the role of companies in addressing climate change. About 65 per cent of Americans surveyed don't think companies pay enough attention to the environment - second last among 20 nations surveyed.

Environmental Defense Fund spokeswoman Keith Gaby told CBS News that although American opinion is divided, other polls have found a large proportion believe some type of action is needed against global climate change. 'But it is true that a very loud minority has made action on climate change more difficult. I think that's because the issue - which should be judged on science - has gotten caught up in partisan politics,' he said.

She can't just jump on the first property that catches her eye. Instead, Patricia needs to consider her budget constraints and identify properties that are within her budget. The first step in this process is understanding her financial limits. Patricia would need to calculate her monthly income versus her expenses. The remaining amount would be the maximum she could afford for mortgage repayments. Ensuring this step allows for a better understanding of her financial capacity and allows her to avoid falling into debt. Next, Patricia should begin her research on the current property market. She can utilize online real estate platforms or reach out to local real estate agents for information. It's important to know the average property prices in the areas she's interested in. By identifying the average costs of properties, she can narrow her search to properties that match her financial capabilities.  In her research, Patricia should also consider other factors such as the condition of the property, transportation connections and proximity to services like schools, shops, and hospitals. Although she might not be able to afford as much as Tanya, she should still strive for a property that meets her basic wants and needs.  After her thorough research, Patricia would be ready to see some properties in person. She should keep an open mind about potential homes, as they might not be perfect but could be improved with minor changes.

He was one of the most important English theologians of the sixteenth century. His defence of the role of redeemed reason informed the theology of the seventeenth century Caroline divines and later provided many members of the Church of England with a theological method which combined the claims of revelation, reason and tradition. Scholars disagree regarding Hooker's relationship with what would later be called \\"Anglicanism\\" and the Reformed theological tradition. Traditionally, he has been regarded as the originator of the Anglican \\"via media\\" between Protestantism and Catholicism. However, a growing number of scholars have argued that he should be considered as being in the mainstream Reformed theology of his time and that he only sought to oppose the extremists, (Puritans) rather than moving the Church of England away from Protestantism.  - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains.

Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Vanuatu (or ; Bislama ), officially the Republic of Vanuatu (Bislama: \\"Ripablik blong Vanuatu\\"), is a Pacific island nation located in the South Pacific Ocean. The archipelago, which is of volcanic origin, is some east of northern Australia, northeast of New Caledonia, east of New Guinea, southeast of the Solomon Islands, and west of Fiji.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Rail transport is a means of conveyance of passengers and goods on wheeled vehicles running on rails, also known as tracks. It is also commonly referred to as train transport. In contrast to road transport, where vehicles run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles (rolling stock) are directionally guided by the tracks on which they run. Tracks usually consist of steel rails, installed on ties (sleepers) and ballast, on which the rolling stock, usually fitted with metal wheels, moves. Other variations are also possible, such as slab track, where the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface.  - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a population of around 518,500, just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart.  - Alice Springs (Arrernte: Mparntwe) is the third largest town in the Northern Territory of Australia. Popularly known as \\"the Alice\\" or simply \\"Alice\\", Alice Springs is situated roughly in Australia's geographic centre.  - South Australia (abbreviated as SA) is a state in the southern central part of Australia. It covers some of the most arid parts of the country. With a total land area of , it is the fourth-largest of Australia's states and territories. It has a total of 1.7 million people, and its population is the most highly centralised of any state in Australia, with more than 75 percent of South Australians living in the capital, Adelaide, or its environs. Other population centres in the state are relatively small.  - East Timor or Timor-Leste (Tetum: \\"Timór Lorosa'e\\"), officially the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, is a sovereign state in Maritime Southeast Asia. It comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor; the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco; and Oecusse, an exclave on the northwestern side of the island surrounded by Indonesian West Timor. The country's size is about 15,410 km (5,400 sq mi).  - Mainland is a contiguous landmass that is larger and often politically, economically and/or demographically more significant than politically associated remote territories, such as exclaves or oceanic islands situated outside the continental shelf.   - A canyon (Spanish: cañón) or gorge is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales. Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces so will eventually wear away rock layers to lessen their own pitch slowing their waters; given enough time, their bottoms will gradually reach a baseline elevationwhich is the same elevation as the body of water it will eventually drain into. This action, when the river source and mouth are at much different base elevations will form a canyon, particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering.  - Heavitree is a district of the city of Exeter in Devon, England. It lies to the east of the city centre, and was formerly the first significant village outside the city on the road to London. It was the birthplace of Thomas Bodley, and Richard Hooker, and until 1818 was a site for executions.  - A water gap is an opening or notch that flowing water has carved through a mountain range. Water gaps often offer a practical route for road and rail transport to cross mountain ridges. Outside of the US, this is called a canyon or gorge.  - The Northern Territory (abbreviated as NT) is a federal Australian territory in the central and central northern regions of Australia. It shares borders with Western Australia to the west (129th meridian east), South Australia to the south (26th parallel south), and Queensland to the east (138th meridian east). To the north, the territory is bordered by the Timor Sea, the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria. Despite its large areaover , making it the third largest Australian federal divisionit is sparsely populated. The Northern Territory's population of 244,000 (2016) makes it the least populous of Australia's eight major states and territories, having fewer than half as many people as Tasmania.  - The Todd River is an ephemeral river in the southern Northern Territory, central Australia. The origins of the Todd River are in the MacDonnell Ranges, where it flows past the Telegraph Station, almost through the center of Alice Springs, through Heavitree Gap at the southern end of Alice Springs and continuing on for some distance, passing through the western part of the Simpson Desert, as it becomes a tributary of the Hale River, and eventually flowing into Lake Eyre in South Australia.  - The Simpson Desert is a large area of dry, red sandy plain and dunes in Northern Territory, South Australia and Queensland in central Australia. It is the fourth largest Australian desert, with an area of 176,500 km (68,100 sq mi) and is the world's largest sand dune desert.  - The MacDonnell Ranges, a mountain range and an interim Australian bioregion, is located in the Northern Territory, comprising . The range is a long series of mountains located in the centre of Australia, and consist of parallel ridges running to the east and west of Alice Springs. The mountain range contains many spectacular gaps and gorges as well as areas of Aboriginal significance.  - Lake Eyre, officially known as Kati ThandaLake Eyre, contains the lowest natural point in Australia, at approximately below sea level (AHD), and, on the rare occasions that it fills, is the largest lake in Australia covering . The shallow endorheic lake is the depocentre of the vast Lake Eyre basin and is found in Northern South Australia, some north of Adelaide.  - A road is a thoroughfare, route, or way on land between two places that has been paved or otherwise improved to allow travel by foot or some form of conveyance, including a motor vehicle, cart, bicycle, or horse.  - Devon (archaically known as Devonshire) is a county of England, reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south. It is part of South West England, bounded by Cornwall to the west, Somerset to the northeast, and Dorset to the east. The City of Exeter is the county town; seven other districts of East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, South Hams, Teignbridge, Torridge, and West Devon are under the jurisdiction of Devon County Council; Plymouth and Torbay are each a part of Devon but administered as unitary authorities. Combined as a ceremonial county, Devon's area is and its population is about 1.1 million.  - Sir Thomas Bodley (2 March 1545  28 January 1613) was an English diplomat and scholar, founder of the modern Bodleian Library, Oxford.  - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.    What is the relationship between 'heavitree gap' and 'northern territory'? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Heavitree Gap, or Ntaripe in the Arrernte language, is a water gap in the MacDonnell Ranges of Central Australia. It is the southern entrance to the city of Alice Springs, which is located in the Northern Territory of Australia. In addition to the Todd River, the Heavitree Gap carries the main road and rail access to the South. The Gap was an important sacred site for the Arrernte people and its use as a thoroughfare was avoided prior to the construction of the road and later rail link. Hence, the relationship between the Heavitree Gap and the Northern Territory is that the Heavitree Gap is a geographical feature located within the Northern Territory, connecting the city of Alice Springs to the southern regions of Australia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . .  that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... How long can someone multitask for before becoming stressed out?

Article:Tries from Graham, Ross McCann and Callum Hunter-Hill gave Scotland a 19-12 lead after an open first half. Will Jones and Ioan Nicholas had scored to keep Wales in touch, before Arwel Robson squeezed over in the corner to put them 25-22 up with 10 minutes left. But Scotland wing Graham crossed six minutes later to set up a fifth-place play-off against Australia on Sunday. Even if they lose against the Wallabies, sixth would be Scotland's highest ever competition finish. Wales' defeat means they will face Italy in a play-off for seventh place, also on Sunday. It could have been a different story had they capitalised on a strong start, as captain Jones cantered over after centre Owen Lane had intercepted a pass from Scotland fly-half Connor Eastgate. Scotland responded in fine fashion as wing Graham touched down in the corner before centre McCann burst through some weak Welsh tackling to put his side 14-5 ahead. Nicholas' incisive finish brought Wales back into contention, only for Scotland captain Hunter-Hill to force his way over from a driving maul. Scotland were denied a second try from a maul on the cusp of half-time when the ball was held up over the Welsh try line. A kicking battle then ensued between the two fly-halves, with Wales' Robson converting two penalties to Eatsgate's one to cut Scotland's lead to 22-18. Robson added a try to his tally as he resisted a last-ditch tackle from Matt Fagerson to touch down in the corner. He then struck a superb touchline conversion to give Wales a 25-22 lead after 70 minutes. But Scotland had the final say, patiently going through several phases before Graham raced clear to avenge their 65-34 defeat against the same opponents during this year's Six Nations. \\"We were disappointed with the result but we played some good stuff at times,\\" Wales Under-20 coach Jason Strange told BBC Wales Sport. \\"We scored four tries against three and that was a real positive for us and I thought there were some good individual performances. \\"I felt ultimately our basics and fundamentals let us down and we lacked possession throughout the game and that was probably the difference. \\"Overall there have been three narrow defeats, results are a part of it but what is important for us is the development of the players and the team, and the learning we take from this. \\"A lot of the players are making a real good progress throughout the tournament.\\" Wales U20: Will Talbot-Davies (Newport Gwent Dragons); Jared Rosser (Newport Gwent Dragons), Ioan Nicholas (Scarlets), Owen Lane (Cardiff Blues), Ryan Conbeer (Scarlets); Arwel Robson (Newport Gwent Dragons) Dane Blacker (Cardiff Blues); Rhys Carre (Cardiff Blues), Ellis Shipp (Newport Gwent Dragons), Kieron Assiratti (Cardiff Blues), Will Griffiths (Ospreys), Sean Moore (Pontypridd), Shane Lewis-Hughes (Cardiff Blues), Will Jones (Ospreys, capt) Aled Ward (Cardiff Blues).

Answer the following question: Article: Can you speak to dolphins? Of course you can but you won't be able to understand them! We interviewed a biologist and asked her what research on dolphin communication has shown. This is what she told us. Just like dogs, cats and other mammals, dolphins communicate by using sound, vision  , touch and taste. Each dolphin has its own signature whistle to identify itself and to call others. Dolphins don't have the ability to smell, but their hearing and eyesight are excellent. We also asked Jane if dolphins have got their own language. She told us that they have and that dolphins started talking to each other from birth. They make different sounds, including whistles, squeaks and click. Sometimes they even sound like a heavy metal band! We then asked Jane if any interesting experiments have been done. She told us that a very interesting experiment had been done with a mother dolphin and her two-year-old baby in an aquarium. They talked to each other over the telephone! The two dolphins were in separate tanks which were connected by a special under water system. Unfortunately the biologists couldn't understand what the dolphins were talking about because they haven't been able to decode   dolphin language yet. However, it was very clear that the dolphins knew what they were talking about. Finally we asked Jane if there was hope that we would be able to understand dolphins in the near future. She told us that she and her team have been listening to dolphins for more than 17 years, using special equipment to record and analyze their language. Unfortunately they haven't been able to decode it yet, but who knows -- maybe one day we'll get a phone call from a dolphin. Question: The interesting experiment tells us  _  .

The assistant was trying to tell him roses were as expensive as forty dollars a dozen  . Maybe he would be happy with carnations .      \\"No, I have to have red roses. \\" He said, \\"My mum was badly ill last year and I didn't get to spend much time with her. Now I want to get something special, it has to be roses as rose is her favourite. \\"       After hearing it, John said he would pay the rest of the money for the young man. Moved by both of them, the assistant said, \\"Well, lovely young men, thirty dollars a dozen, only for you. \\"Taking the roses, the young man almost jumped into the air and ran out of the shop. It was well worth twenty-five dollars John paid to see the exciting moment. Then John paid for his dozen of roses and told the assistant to send them to his mother.       As he walked out, he felt nice. Suddenly he saw the young man crossing the street and going into a park. But soon he realized it was not a park but a cemetery  . Crying, the young man carefully laid the roses,\\" Mum, oh, Mum, why didn't I tell you how much I loved you ?

She was aware of the young man's financial constraint as he had only five dollars and she knew that a dozen of roses typically cost forty dollars. Given the price he had stated he could afford, the assistant suggested carnations, which were likely less expensive than roses, and therefore a more reasonable option considering his budget. The situation of the young man entered John's heart, who was touched by the hardship of someone who, despite financial difficulties and the loss of his mother, was still committed to show his love in the form of her favorite flowers. The young man's desire was not to buy just any flowers, but specifically red roses, signaling the particular meaning they hold for him and his late mother.  It moved John to the point of generosity, and he offered to pay the difference so that the young man could purchase the roses. The florist, touched by this display of kindness, decided to offer a discount to them, reducing the price to thirty dollars a dozen. John also bought roses for his own mother, initially intending to have them sent to her. However, after witnessing the young man's visceral grief in the cemetery, he changed his mind. He decided to take his own flowers home himself, perhaps understanding the importance of personal, face-to-face expressions of love and the sorrow that can come from missed opportunities to say, \\"I love you\\".  It taught John that while work may keep him physically from his family and may occupy most of his time, he should strive harder to show his love to his remaining family while he still has the opportunity. This event also highlighted for John how small acts of kindness, like his help to the young man at the flower shop, can create significant bright moments in the lives of others, in this case affording the young man the chance to demonstrate his enduring love for his mother, despite her having passed on."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the answer, I will address both questions separately. 1. Why has Russia never hunted the Jews for the murder of its 90 million citizens? The premise of this question is based on an assumption that is not rooted in historical accuracy. It seems to suggest that Jews were responsible for the murder of 90 million Russian citizens, but there is no evidence proving that claim. Instead, the history of Jews in Russia is one of discrimination, segregation, and suffering. During the Russian Empire, Jews primarily lived within the Pale of Settlement, where they were subject to a wide range of persecutions, including pogroms and forced conscriptions into the military. Following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the new Soviet government abolished antisemitic laws, but instances of antisemitism persisted at different levels of the state. The Stalin era brought accusations of a \\"rootless cosmopolitanism\\" and other forms of anti-Jewish ideology. During World War II, millions of Jews were killed by Nazi forces as they invaded the Soviet Union, with many more suffering at the hands of local collaborators. The Soviet government, though it ultimately fought against the Nazis, did not do much to specifically aid its Jewish population. Post-WWII, Jews in the Soviet Union faced a resurgence of state-sponsored antisemitism, culminating in the \\"Doctors' Plot\\" - a fabricated conspiracy accusing prominent Jewish doctors of plotting to assassinate government leadership. Fortunately, Stalin's death in 1953 prevented a wave of purges and other jews persecution actions. It is not the case that Russia has never hunted the Jews for the murder of 90 million citizens because there is no factual basis for that premise. On the contrary, Jews have faced considerable persecution in Russia throughout history. 2. What types of things do Holocaust deniers say? That Jews were never murdered? Or that those who were murdered weren't all Jewish? Holocaust denial is a form of antisemitism that seeks to deny or distort the historical reality of the Holocaust, where six million Jews, along with millions of other people, were systematically murdered by the Nazis during World War II. The arguments put forth by Holocaust deniers can be summarized into three main categories: a) Denying the existence of the Holocaust: Some Holocaust deniers claim that the Holocaust never happened or was grossly exaggerated. They might argue that the number of Jewish victims was significantly lower than six million or that there was no systematic plan to exterminate Jews. b) Denying the use of extermination camps and gas chambers: Another argument put forth by deniers is that concentration camps were merely labor camps and not extermination camps, thus denying the use of gas chambers. They may assert that the gas chambers purportedly used for mass murder were only built for delousing or other non-lethal purposes. c) Claiming Jewish involvement in fabricating the Holocaust: Some Holocaust deniers go as far as to claim that Jews fabricated the Holocaust as a way to gain sympathy, financial aid, or support for the creation of the State of Israel. They might allege that the testimonies of survivors, documents, and photographs are all forgeries or manipulations. Although Holocaust denial is soundly discredited by a substantial body of evidence, including eyewitness accounts, documents, photographs, and physical remains, it persists as a virulent form of antisemitism based on conspiracy theories and unfounded claims."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She had presented a talk on black holes in the evening, but was found dead in the morning by the manager of the observatory. She had been shot in the face, but there was no weapon. There is a sock and a jar of moisturizing cream found at the scene. The manager claims that he was out all night with an associate. The sock is traced to Jennifer's boyfriend, who claims he left hurriedly to work on a new theory. Jennifer's home is full of tchotchkes and other old nick-nacks. Mike passes out when she picks up a Florida snow globe, and imagines unique blue marbles similar to one that is on a string around her neck. When she comes to, she talks about the marble, and how she doesn't remember where it came from. She was an orphan, and has always had it. Her co-investigator and supervisor suggest that this looks like \\"The .38 Caliber Killer\\", who killed young women, but hadn't struck in many years. The murderer always exchanged nick nacks with his victims. While doing a more detailed search of the area, Mike finds a gun in a case, and a red scarf she had been having dreams about. The gun, a .38 revolver, is traced to the observatory manager, who admits he found it, and tried to dispose of it so he wouldn't be a suspect. Figuring from where the gun originally lay, Mike concludes that Jennifer had shot herself. The investigators agree.

How to write a novella  Focus on a particular theme or idea.  Novellas work best if they are centered on one theme or idea. Choose a theme like \\" love, \\" \\" identity, \\" or \\" loss \\" and explore it in more detail in the novella.","output":"In the subsequent paragraph, we will delve deeper into the process of writing a novella, discussing how to develop the chosen theme or idea, examining the importance of character development, and offering tips on creating an engaging plot, style, and structure. Developing the theme or idea Once you've selected a theme or idea like \\"love,\\" \\"identity,\\" or \\"loss,\\" it's crucial to brainstorm different ways to approach it and understand the various aspects of its intricacies. Consider what aspects of this theme resonate with you personally, and how you can explore its different facets in creative and thought-provoking ways. As you write, strive to dig beneath the surface of the theme and investigate its emotional, psychological, and societal implications. By doing so, you can create a unique and riveting story that will captivate your readers and encourage them to ponder the theme in greater depth. Creating unique and relatable characters Characters are an essential component of any novella, and well-developed characters can truly bring your story to life. Each character must have their own distinct personality, background, and purpose in your story. They should feel like real individuals, with their own strengths, weaknesses, beliefs, and desires. Your main characters should also have a strong connection to the central theme or particular idea of your novella. This means that their personal journeys should revolve around exploring, challenging, or grappling with the theme. Ensure that your characters grow, evolve, or learn throughout the novella, as it will make for a more satisfying and engaging read. Crafting an engaging plot Aside from characters and themes, the plot is an essential component of an effective novella. The plot must be engaging, emotionally resonant, and concise. Unlike longer novels, which may require multiple plotlines to intertwine and overlap, a novella often benefits from a singular, focused narrative arc. Thoroughly outline your plot, ensuring that it follows a clear structure with a beginning, middle, and end, and includes a well-defined conflict or task that your characters must face. Moreover, the plot should also center around the chosen theme, delving into various aspects of it throughout the novella. Utilize moments of tension, suspense, or confrontation to keep your readers engaged and maintain a tight pace without sacrificing the development of your characters or theme. Developing an effective literary style and structure The literary style in which you write your novella will significantly impact the overall reading experience. Consider experimenting with various styles and structures: first-person or third-person narrative, linear or non-linear storytelling, or the use of alternating perspectives. Choose the approach that best highlights the depth of your characters and the intricacies of your theme. Polished prose, thoughtfully chosen imagery, and powerful symbolism can significantly enhance your novella, allowing you to convey specific emotions or communicate deeper meanings. Pay attention to your writing's pacing, ensuring that the narrative flows smoothly while still providing the essential information and character interactions that develop your characters and advance the story. In conclusion, effectively writing a novella centered on a particular theme or idea involves careful consideration of character development, engaging plotlines, literary style, and structure. By thoroughly examining the chosen theme, crafting relatable and unique characters, and concocting an intriguing plot that resonates with readers, you can create an unforgettable novella that draws readers in and encourages them to reflect on the powerful themes within your story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly.  Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light.

Substructure:     - Dynamic programming relies on the principle of optimality, where solving smaller subproblems helps in the overall solution of the problem.     - Greedy algorithms don't fully rely on this principle and often make decisions based on the current state without always ensuring an overall optimal solution. 3. Backtracking:     - Dynamic programming allows for backtracking and making alternative choices if the initially chosen path does not lead to an optimal solution.     - Greedy algorithms do not consider potential backtracking, as they move forward based on the current best choice. 4. Problem-solving scope:     - Dynamic programming is suitable for a broader range of problems, including those that cannot be solved optimally by greedy algorithms.     - Greedy algorithms work well for specific problems where the local optimum choice always leads to the global optimum solution.  As for which should be practiced first, it depends on the individual's learning preference and understanding of algorithms. However, it is generally recommended to start practicing greedy algorithms, as they are easier to understand and apply. Once you have a good grasp of greedy algorithms, you can proceed to learn and practice dynamic programming. Regarding the question about whether the two questions have the same meaning, the answer would be: * no.  The two questions address different aspects: one asks about the differences between the two techniques, while the other inquires about the recommended learning order."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The southern state of Alabama is the center of the U.S. political universe this week as voters on Tuesday choose a senator to replace Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate to become attorney general. The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics.  Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\\" Trump said. In the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda. \\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\\" Moore said.  Democrat Jones told supporters that Moore's character is the issue. \\"We know who we are, Alabama, we know who we are. This is an election to tell the world who we are and what we stand for.\\" Question: President Trump likely believes that the Alabama Senate election: Options: - not worthwhile to endorse heavily or to bring too much national attention to.   - will be highly contended and drastically impacted by Roy Moore's allegations of sexual misconduct.   - not enough information   - swayed and in favor of the Republican candidate. === The correct answer is","output":"- swayed and in favor of the Republican candidate. Justification: From the text, it is clear that despite initial hesitance, President Trump eventually gave his endorsement to the Republican candidate, Roy Moore. His endorsement shows that he likely believes in Moore's chances of winning, which suggests that he believes the Alabama Senate election could be swayed and in favor of the Republican candidate. The text shows this through quotes such as \\"Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday.\\", \\"Do it. Do it,\\" he said, and \\"now says electing Moore is a priority for him.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Bush's 1992 re-election campaign in New Jersey, and became close to Bush's state director, Bill Palatucci. Following the campaign, Christie decided to run for office, and moved to Mendham Township. In 1993, Christie launched a primary challenge against the New Jersey Senate Majority Leader, John H. Dorsey. However, Christie's campaign ended after Dorsey successfully challenged the validity of Christie's petition to appear on the ballot.  In 1994, Christie was elected as a Republican to the Board of Chosen Freeholders, or legislators, for Morris County, New Jersey, after he and a running mate defeated incumbent freeholders in the party primary. Following the election, the defeated incumbents filed a defamation lawsuit against Christie based on statements made during the primary campaign. Christie had incorrectly stated that the incumbents were under \\"investigation\\" for violating certain local laws. The lawsuit was settled out of court, with Christie acknowledging that the prosecutor had actually convened an \\"inquiry\\" instead of an \\"investigation\\", and apologizing for the error, which he said was unintentional.  As freeholder, Christie required the county government to obtain three quotes from qualified firms for all contracts. He led a successful effort to bar county officials from accepting gifts from people and firms doing business with the county. He voted to raise the county's open space tax for land preservation; however, county taxes on the whole were decreased by 6.6% during his tenure. He successfully pushed for the dismissal of an architect hired to design a new jail, saying that the architect was costing taxpayers too much money. The architect then sued Christie for defamation over remarks he made about the dismissal, eventually dropping the suit without explanation.  In 1995, Christie announced a bid for a seat in the New Jersey General Assembly; he and attorney Rick Merkt ran as a ticket against incumbent Assemblyman Anthony Bucco and attorney Michael Patrick Carroll in the Republican primary. Christie ran as a pro-choice candidate and supporter of the ban on assault weapons. Bucco and Carroll, the establishment candidates, defeated the up-and-comers by a wide margin. After this loss, Christie's bid for re-nomination to the freeholder board was unlikely, as unhappy Republicans recruited John J. Murphy to run against Christie in 1997. Murphy defeated Christie in the primary. Murphy, who had falsely accused Christie of having the county pay his legal bills in the architect's lawsuit, was sued by Christie after the election. They settled out of court with the Freeholders admitting wrongdoing and apologizing. Christie's career in Morris County politics was over by 1998.

It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - The Abbasid Caliphate (or \\"\\") was the third of the Islamic caliphates to succeed the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The Abbasid dynasty descended from Muhammad's youngest uncle, Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib (566653 CE), from whom the dynasty takes its name. They ruled as caliphs, for most of their period from their capital in Baghdad in modern-day Iraq, after assuming authority over the Muslim empire from the Umayyads in 750 CE (132 AH).  - The Sasanian Empire (or ), also known as Sassanian, Sasanid, Sassanid or Neo-Persian Empire), known to its inhabitants as rnshahr in Middle Persian, was the last imperial dynasty in Persia (Iran) before the rise of Islam, ruled by and named after the Sasanian dynasty from 224 to 651 AD.

It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God.  - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya.

Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity and ensured that his teachings, practices, and the Quran, formed the basis of Islamic religious belief.  - The Avesta is the primary collection of religious texts of Zoroastrianism, composed in the otherwise unrecorded Avestan language.    What is the relationship between 'mazyar' and 'zoroastrianism'? Answer:","output":"Mazyar was an Iranian prince from the Qarinvand dynasty and a feudal ruler of the mountainous region of Tabaristan during the Abbasid Caliphate era. His name, \\"Mazyar,\\" means \\"protected by the Yazata of the moon.\\" In this context, the term \\"Yazata\\" is an Avestan word, which denotes a Zoroastrian concept generally signifying a divinity or an entity worthy of worship or veneration. This shows a connection between Mazyar's name and Zoroastrianism, as the religion was influential in the region and among the ruling elite during the time Mazyar ruled. Zoroastrianism is one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions, and it originated in ancient Persia (modern-day Iran) around the 6th century BCE. Founded by the prophet Zoroaster (also known as Zarathustra), the religion centered around the teachings and principles laid out in its holy book, the Avesta. The region of Tabaristan, which Mazyar ruled, was a stronghold of Zoroastrianism during the Sassanian Empire (224 – 651 AD). This empire was the last pre-Islamic Persian empire and widely recognized as one of the leading world powers at the time, alongside the Roman-Byzantine Empire. The Sasanian Empire was known for actively supporting and promoting the Zoroastrian faith. However, the Islamic Conquest of Persia in the mid-7th century led to the decline of Zoroastrianism and the eventual rise of Islam as the dominant religion in Iran. Muslim conquerors started to impose Islamic rule over various territories that were part of the Sasanian Empire, including Tabaristan. Mazyar's role in the context of Zoroastrianism is particularly significant due to his resistance against the Abbasid Caliphate, which sought to spread Islam across its controlled territories. For his opposition to the Abbasid rule and defense of his people, culture, and the Zoroastrian faith, Mazyar is considered one of Iran's national heroes by 20th-century Iranian nationalist historiography. In summary, the relationship between Mazyar and Zoroastrianism is rooted in the historical context of Tabaristan and the Sasanian Empire. Mazyar's name, which reflects Zoroastrian concepts, denotes a connection to the religion, and his role in resisting the Abbasid Caliphate during the Islamic Conquests is part of why he is remembered as a significant figure in Iranian history. Mazyar's opposition to the Abbasid rule and his defense of the Zoroastrian faith highlight the deep ties between his identity and Zoroastrianism."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The exercise is to decide whether the question accepts the proposed suggestion as a correct answer.

His 12,000-strong forces then attacked Toungoo, then ruled by his cousin, Natshinnaung, in August 1610. After a siege of 23 days, Natshinnaung agreed to become a vassal on 4 September 1610. But Natshinnaung was deeply unhappy with his reduced status, and secretly invited de Brito of Syriam to attack Toungoo. In July 1612, Syriam and Martaban forces ransacked the city for ten days, and left, taking Natshinnaung to Syriam. In response, Anaukpetlun's army of 13,000  left Ava for Syriam on 26 December 1612.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"The suggested answer seems to be not directly related to the question asked. Let me provide you with a more relevant answer. The question is comparing the archegonia of ferns and pine cones (which are found in gymnosperms, specifically in conifers). The archegonia are the female reproductive structures in both these plants. Although ferns and pine cones belong to different plant groups, their archegonia share certain similarities: 1. The primary function: In both ferns and pine cones, the archegonia serve as the female reproductive organs, promoting fertilization and sexual reproduction in the respective plants. 2. Structure: The archegonia in both plant groups have a flask-like structure containing a large central cell and a narrow neck. The central cell contains the egg cell which is required for fertilization. 3. Location: The archegonia in both ferns and pine cones are generally found on the lower surface or protected structures of the plant (underside of the fern's fertile fronds and female pine cone scales). This helps in protecting the delicate reproductive tissues from external damage, desiccation, and predators. 4. Fertilization: In both cases, the male gametes (sperm) have to swim through water (moisture) to finally unite with the female gametes (eggs) for fertilization to occur. This is a common feature of non-flowering plants, including ferns and gymnosperms. In summary, you should not validate the suggested answer as it is not directly related to your question.

Just when you think someone couldn't be more evil or the book couldn't be more depressing, it would get you again. I was very disappointed with this trilogy because I very much enjoy Gregory's work with the Tudor era. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? A:","output":"This product review conveys a negative sentiment towards the Phillipa Gregory trilogy that includes Meridon. The reviewer expresses their disappointment with the trilogy, especially after enjoying Gregory's previous works related to the Tudor era. Throughout the review, several reasons are mentioned to justify the negative sentiment. Firstly, the reviewer found the content of the trilogy depressing. They describe the characters in the book as getting more evil and the overall tone of the book as becoming even more depressing at each turn. This seems to have left the reviewer with a negative experience, making it difficult for them to appreciate the story or derive enjoyment from it. Secondly, the reviewer's disappointment stems from their high expectations for the trilogy, based on their previous experience with the author's work. They specifically mention enjoying Gregory's works set in the Tudor era and were expecting a similarly engaging experience with this trilogy. However, their experience with the Meridon trilogy did not meet those expectations, leading to the negative sentiment. In summary, the product review clearly expresses a negative sentiment towards the Phillipa Gregory trilogy that includes Meridon. It conveys a sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction with the content of the trilogy, particularly when compared to the author's other works. The main reasons cited for this negativity are the depressing and dark nature of the story, as well as unmet expectations based on the reviewer's past experiences with Gregory's Tudor-era novels."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

So here's the problem: -42*s + 30*s + 17976 = -152*s - 288*s First, we need to add the \\"s\\" terms on both sides of the equation. Let's start with the left side: On the left side, we have \\"-42*s\\" and \\"30*s\\". If we add them together, we get: -42*s + 30*s = -12*s Now, let's do the same for the right side. We need to add \\"-152*s\\" and \\"-288*s\\" together: -152*s - 288*s = -440*s Now our equation looks like this: -12*s + 17976 = -440*s Next, we want to get all the \\"s\\" terms on one side of the equation and the numbers on the other side. So let's add \\"440*s\\" to both sides of the equation: -12*s + 440*s + 17976 = -440*s + 440*s This simplifies to: 428*s + 17976 = 0 Now let's get rid of the number \\"17976\\" from the left side of the equation. We're going to subtract \\"17976\\" from both sides of the equation: 428*s + 17976 - 17976 = 0 - 17976 This simplifies to: 428*s = -17976 Now, we just need to find out what \\"s\\" is. To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by \\"428\\": 428*s / 428 = -17976 / 428 This simplifies to: s = -42 So our final answer is: s = -42.

Step 2: Analyze the given options. - Danger: This option is too vague and doesn't specify the actual situation that occurred. - Slow down: Slowing down isn't necessarily an incident that requires quick thinking and is usually a controlled and normal aspect of flying. - Catch on fire: This option represents an emergency situation that would require immediate and critical decision-making by Jane to manage and potentially save lives. - Arrive late: This doesn't seem to be a scenario that would warrant a medal or promotion for a pilot as it is quite common and doesn't highlight their quick thinking or heroism. - Carry freight: This option doesn't relate to the context of quick thinking and doesn't suggest an event that would lead to a pilot receiving a medal or promotion. Step 3: Choose the option that best aligns with the required quick thinking and merits a medal and promotion. - Catch on fire: Out of all the options, this is the most plausible scenario where Jane would have needed to use her quick thinking and take immediate action to handle the situation, potentially saving lives and property.

The original statement provides us with the following details: 1. The couple's age: The couple is described as \\"elderly,\\" which indicates that they are likely in their later years of life. This specific detail helps paint a more vivid picture of the scene and may be relevant to understanding the context or the significance of their walk. 2. The location: The couple is walking in a field filled with American flags. This tells us that the surroundings play a significant role in their walk. The presence of American flags may symbolize patriotism, a memorial, a celebration, or simply a beautiful and unique setting. By including this detail, the reader can better visualize the scene and possibly interpret its meaning. 3. National context: The mention of American flags implies that the story occurs in, or is somehow related to, the United States of America. This national context may influence potential cultural references or thematic elements in the narrative. When we extract the simplified conclusion, \\"A couple take a walk together,\\" we lose these extra layers of details and nuances. While it is accurate in portraying the basic activity the couple is engaged in, it does not maintain the richness of the original statement. By removing the couple's age, location, and national context, the conclusion becomes more generic, less visually captivating, and potentially less meaningful to the reader.

Solve -1970 + 5506 = 221*x for x.","output":"To solve the equation -1970 + 5506 = 221*x for x, you first need to simplify the left-hand side of the equation.  The equation begins with: -1970 + 5506 = 221*x When you add -1970 to 5506, you get: 3536 = 221*x Now, the goal is to solve for x, which means we need to get x by itself on one side of the equation. Therefore, you'll need to isolate x. In order to do that, we need to get rid of the 221 that is currently being multiplied by x.  Since 221*x means 221 times x, you'll do the opposite operation, which is division, to cancel it out. We divide both sides of the equation by 221 to leave x by itself: 3536 / 221 = x If you do the division, you will get approximately 16. The precise value is 16.00226843100189 (and it continues).  Therefore, based on the above calculations, the solution to -1970 + 5506 = 221*x is x ≈ 16 or more precisely x = 16.00226843100189. In other words, when x is approximately 16, or 16.00226843100189, the equation balances or is true.

A few days later, reports surfaced that the band had broken up before they had played for a public audience.

According to the band, however, the split was not triggered by personal conflicts, but by their quarreling managers. After the mixing of the album was finished, roughly six weeks later, the group reformed and simultaneously fired their former management companies and hired another, The Firm.

Given the below context:  Petrus Christus placed his sitter in a naturalistic setting rather than a flat and featureless background. This approach was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces. In his 1462 Portrait of a Man, Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape, while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts. Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power. Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo's positioning of the Mona Lisa in front of a landscape view. Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff and Martin Schongauer among others.The Netherlandish artists moved away from the profile view – popularised during the Italian Quattrocento – towards the less formal but more engaging three-quarter view. At this angle, more than one side of the face is visible as the sitter's body is rotated towards the viewer. This pose gives a better view of the shape and features of the head and allows the sitter to look out towards the viewer. The gaze of the sitter rarely engages the viewer. Van Eyck's 1433 Portrait of a Man is an early example, which shows the artist himself looking at the viewer.  Although there is often direct eye contact between subject and viewer, the look is normally detached, aloof and uncommunicative, perhaps to reflect the subject's high social position. There are exceptions, typically in bridal portraits or in the case of potential...  Guess a valid title for it!

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person that is was said his trumpet playing with the warmth of the sun's rays?, using the article: Critical analysis of Beiderbecke's work during his lifetime was sparse. Surprisingly, his innovative playing initially received greater attention and appreciation among European critics than those in the country of his birth. The British music trade magazine \\"Melody Maker\\" published a number of reviews of his recordings and assessments of his cornet playing. In the April 1927 issue, bandleader Fred Elizalde stated: \\"Bix Bidlebeck (sic) is considered by Red Nichols himself and every other trumpet player in the States, for that matter, as the greatest trumpet player of all time\\". The magazine's editor, Edgar Jackson, was equally fulsome in his praise: \\"Bix has a heart as big as your head, which shines through his playing with the warmth of the sun's rays\\" (September 1927 issue); \\"The next sixteen bars are a trumpet solo by Bix, and if this doesn't get you right in the heart, you'd better see a vet….\\" In Blackboard Jungle, a 1955 film starring Glenn Ford and Sidney Poitier, Beiderbecke's music is briefly featured, but as a symbol of cultural conservatism in a nation on the cusp of the rock and roll revolution. Brendan Wolfe, the author of Finding Bix, spoke of Beiderbecke's lasting influence on Davenport, Iowa: \\"His name and face are still a huge part of the city's identity. There's an annual Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival, and a Bix 7 road race with tens of thousands of runners, Bix T-shirts, bumper stickers, bobble-head dolls, the whole works.\\" In 1971, on the 40th anniversary of Beiderbecke's death, the Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival was founded in Davenport, Iowa, to honor the musician.  In 1974, Sudhalter and Evans published their biography, Bix: Man and Legend, which was nominated for a National Book Award. In 1977, the Beiderbecke childhood home at 1934 Grand Avenue in Davenport was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\\"Bix: 'Ain't None of Them Play Like Him Yet\\", a 1981 film documentary on Beiderbecke's life directed and produced by Brigitte Berman, featured interviews with..., what would be the answer ?

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Starvation When the body is deprived of nourishment for an extended period of time, it goes into “survival mode. ” The first priority for survival is to provide enough glucose or fuel for the brain. The second priority is the conservation of amino acids for proteins. Therefore, the body uses ketones to satisfy the energy needs of the brain and other glucose-dependent organs, and to maintain proteins in the cells (see Figure 24.2). Because glucose levels are very low during starvation, glycolysis will shut off in cells that can use alternative fuels. For example, muscles will switch from using glucose to fatty acids as fuel.

The other options, such as \\"loss of money\\" or \\"run out of money,\\" do not accurately capture the idea that Joe is spending more money than he would like. \\"Spending money\\" is a general term that does not encompass the specific problem of excessive spending, and \\"deficit\\" suggests a negative balance rather than spending more than desired.

Please answer the following question: I had this one guy, who enjoyed being a part time bully and part time neutral to me. To say the least he was annoying. He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who came of age during a period when a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality?  Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his...

The party was at first conceived by members of the Radical-Socialist Party tied to the business world who united themselves in May 1901, along with many moderates, as gathering center-left liberals and \\"Opportunist\\" Republicans (Gambetta, etc.). However, after World War I and the parliamentary disappearance of monarchists and Bonapartists, it quickly became the main center-right party of the Third Republic. It was part of the National Bloc right-wing coalition which won the elections after the end of the war. The ARD successively took the name \\"Parti Républicain Démocratique\\" (Democratic Republican Party, PRD) then \\"Parti Républicain Démocratique et Social\\" (\\"Social and Republican Democratic Party\\"), before becoming again the AD.  - Léon Gambetta (2 April 1838  31 December 1882) was a French statesman, prominent during and after the Franco-Prussian War.  - The Democratic and Social Action ( French : Action démocratique et sociale , ADS ) was a French parliamentary group in the Chamber of Deputies of France during the French Third Republic between 1928 and 1932 .

It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - André Siegfried (April 21, 1875  March 28, 1959) was a French academic, geographer and political writer best known for his commentaries on American, Canadian, and British politics.  - The Republican Federation (FR) was the largest conservative party during the French Third Republic, gathering together the liberal Orleanists rallied to the Republic.

He was the son of Luis Antonio and Balbina Acosta and lived most of his life in his native province far from the limelights of Buenos Aires and the academic world which he sincerely despised in favor of a bucolic and rural setting of his father 's cattle farm in Belén . At age seventeen Franco was awarded a literary prize for his Oda primaveral . Franco traveled a considerable distance to receive the award riding on a mule 's back from Catamarca Province to Tucuman . The attitude raised a few eyebrows in Buenos Aires and a relevant article was publish in the prestigious magazine Caras y caretas relating the story of this promising young author . The first literary personality to open the doors to Franco was Horacio Quiroga . Quiroga would eventually introduced Franco to Leopoldo Lugones who recognized his talent and potential . Soon Franco became a recognizable name in the literary world of his time making the acquaintance of Roberto Arlt , Gabriela Mistral and Juana de Ibarbourou amongst others . However , Luis Franco found it difficult to coexist with the cultural apparatus and the bourgeois - style of other intellectuals in Buenos Aires , and soon - after completing his High School degree - returned to his hometown of Belén . In Belén , Franco resided most of his adult life doing what he loved most : working the land , reading and writing . As a result of a personal crisis -- coincidental with the military coup of general José Evaristo Uriburu in 1930 - Franco dissociates himself from right wing revisionists such as Lugones and begins an audacious journey of introspection in the nature of Argentina 's political past . The result is a copious bibliography of essays where the ghost of saints and devils of Argentina 's turbulent 1800 's comes to life in a unique fashion , one that perhaps Franco only shares with Ezequiel Martínez Estrada . \`\` Here  s a pagan poet who loves...  - Santiago del Estero (Spanish for \\"Saint-James-Upon-The-Lagoon\\") is the capital of Santiago del Estero Province in northern Argentina.

Q:Answer the question below:   The closer that water gets to the shore the more or fewer nutrients there are?    Assuming that:  Most nutrients are washed into ocean water from land. Therefore, water closer to shore tends to have more nutrients. A:","output":"Water tends to have more nutrients closer to the shore. Since most nutrients in ocean water come from land sources such as rivers, rocks, and human activities, waters near the shoreline are generally richer in nutrients. Various land-based materials like organic matter, minerals, and nutrients get washed into bodies of water through processes like weathering, rainfall, and runoff from agricultural land and urban areas. When these nutrients reach the ocean, they become part of the marine ecosystem and contribute to the growth of various aquatic organisms, including plankton, algae, seaweed, and seagrasses. These primary producers form the base of the marine food web and support other species such as crustaceans, fish, and marine mammals. Closer to the shore, these nutrients are usually more concentrated due to their proximity to their sources. As you move farther offshore, nutrients become more diluted as they disperse throughout the vast ocean waters. Additionally, coastal currents, upwelling, and wave action tend to mix and circulate nutrients along the shorelines, maintaining higher nutrient levels in these areas. Keep in mind that there can be exceptions to this general pattern, depending on local factors such as oceanic currents and human intervention.

In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.  After reading the above, is \\"Mohamed Atta\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Who was a student at Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg until 1999?\\"?","output":"Yes, \\"Mohamed Atta\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"Who was a student at Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg until 1999?\\" The text states that Atta enrolled at the University of Hamburg and then transferred to the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he remained registered as a student until the fall of 1999."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What character does the guard  think mistake for a Prince? Movie plot title: The Prince and the Pauper Movie plot: In Tudor England, two boys are born on the same day in the most different circumstances imaginable. Tom (Billy Mauch) is the son of vicious criminal John Canty (Barton MacLane), while Edward VI (Bobby Mauch) is a prince and the heir of King Henry VIII of England (Montagu Love). One grows up in poverty, hungering for something better for himself and his family, the other in isolated luxury, with a strong curiosity about the outside world. When they are youngsters, they meet and are astounded by their striking resemblance to each other. As a prank, they exchange clothes, but the Captain of the Guard (Alan Hale, Sr.) mistakes the prince for the pauper and throws him out of the palace grounds. Tom is unable to convince anybody except for the Earl of Hertford (Claude Rains) of his identity. Everyone else is convinced that he is mentally ill. When Henry VIII dies, Hertford threatens to expose Tom unless he does as he is told. Hertford also blackmails the Captain into searching for the real prince to eliminate the dangerous loose end. Meanwhile, Edward finds an amused, if disbelieving protector in Miles Hendon (Errol Flynn). An attempt to assassinate the boy on the instigation of the Earl of Hertford, who fears for his power if the real king lives, changes Hendon's opinion of Edward's story. With Hendon's help, Edward manages to re-enter the palace just in time to interrupt the coronation ceremony and prove his identity.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"After carefully analyzing the information provided in the question and the suggested answer, it is necessary to scrutinize the validity of the response before validation. The original question is focused on identifying a country with a single solid color flag. However, the suggested answer appears to describe various well-known flags like the 37-star flag of the United States, the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom, the Russian Imperial Standard, and the French tricolore, each of which has multiple colors and designs. As a result, the suggested answer does not address the query directly. To provide a more accurate response to the initial question, we must identify a flag that displays a single color without any symbols or additional design elements. The Libyan flag from 1977 to 2011 fulfills this criterion as it consisted of only one color, plain green, without any additional symbols or designs. This flag is no longer in use since 2011, when Libya adopted a new flag featuring red, black, and green horizontal stripes, with a white crescent and star centered within the black stripe. In summary, the suggested answer does not appropriately address the original question, as it fails to mention a country with a single solid color flag. Instead, the response describes several historically significant flags with multiple colors and designs. Therefore, it is not advisable to validate this answer. Instead, the following response provides the accurate information: \\"The Libyan flag from 1977 to 2011 was the only national flag that had a single solid color - green - without any other design elements or symbols.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a hypothesis: The EPA has no statement on rules for air and water. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"No, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. A careful examination of the premise, hypothesis, and their relationship can help us understand why this is the case. Premise: On December 17, 1993, EPA (the Environmental Protection Agency) published a notice of proposed rulemaking on the integrated air and water rules in the Federal Register. The premise tells us that the EPA was, in fact, involved in proposing rules related to air and water. The Federal Register is a daily publication of the United States government and serves as the official journal for regulations, proposed rules, and notices. The publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register means that the EPA was in the process of developing and seeking public input on new regulations for air and water. This action demonstrates that the EPA was actively working to establish, clarify, or modify rules regarding these resources. Hypothesis: The EPA has no statement on rules for air and water. Contrary to the premise, the hypothesis asserts that the EPA has not made any statement or taken any position on the rules governing air and water. It suggests that there is no existing regulatory framework for air and water, or at least none that has been acknowledged or presented by the EPA. Consequently, this hypothesis contradicts the premise. Relationship between the premise and the hypothesis: The premise provides evidence of the EPA's active role in developing rules for air and water management, while the hypothesis attempts to claim that the EPA has no statement regarding these rules. As the premise directly contradicts the hypothesis, it is not possible to logically conclude that if the premise is true (which it is, given the exact date of the publication in the Federal Register), then the hypothesis is also true. Instead, the given premise demonstrates that the hypothesis is inaccurate and that the EPA has indeed engaged in rulemaking processes related to air and water management. In conclusion, it is incorrect to infer that the given hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The evidence presented in the premise directly contradicts the claim made in the hypothesis. Thus, it is more accurate to state that if the premise is true (which it is), the hypothesis is false."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As the problem begins on the left side with two constant terms (-45 and +298), we should first add them together: -70*c - 45 + 298 =  -70*c + (298 - 45) = -70*c + 253 So now the equation becomes: -70*c + 253 = -27 Step 2: Isolate the term that includes the variable (c) by subtracting 253 from both sides of the equation.  -70*c + 253 - 253 = -27 - 253 This simplifies to: -70*c = -280 Step 3: To solve for c, divide both sides of the equation by -70: -70*c / -70 = -280 / -70 This simplifies to: c = 4 So, the solution to the equation -70*c - 45 + 298 = -27 is c = 4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Another letter to The New York Times blamed the shark infestation on the maneuvers of German U-boats near America's East Coast. The anonymous writer claimed, \\"These sharks may have devoured human bodies in the waters of the German war zone and followed liners to this coast, or even followed the Deutschland herself, expecting the usual toll of drowning men, women, and children.\\" The writer concluded, \\"This would account for their boldness and their craving for human flesh.\\"Decades later, there is no consensus among researchers over Murphy and Lucas's investigation and findings.

Researchers such as Thomas Helm, Harold W. McCormick, Thomas B. Allen, William Young, Jean Campbell Butler, and Michael Capuzzo generally agree with Murphy and Lucas. However, the National Geographic Society reported in 2002 that \\"some experts are suggesting that the great white may not in fact be responsible for many of the attacks pinned on the species.

However, campaign organizers offered no bail in order \\"to focus the attention of the media and national public opinion on the Birmingham situation\\".Twenty-four hours after his arrest, King was allowed to see local attorneys from the SCLC. When Coretta Scott King did not hear from her husband, she called Walker and he suggested that she call President Kennedy directly. Mrs. King was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child when she received a call from President Kennedy the Monday after the arrest. The president told her she could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped. Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated.Using scraps of paper given to him by a janitor, notes written on the margins of a newspaper, and later a legal pad given to him by SCLC attorneys, King wrote his essay \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\". It responded to eight politically moderate white clergymen who accused King of agitating local residents and not giving the incoming mayor a chance to make any changes. Bass suggested that \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\" was pre-planned, as was every move King and his associates made in Birmingham. The essay was a culmination of many of King's ideas, which he had touched on in earlier writings. King's arrest attracted national attention, including...

But Andersen, a 46-year-old father of four, wasn't expecting any trouble on the road last New Year's Eve, when he set off for a ski trip to the Bear Mountains with nine-year-old daughter Mia, four-old son Baylor, and nine-year-old neighbor Kenya. Andersen had driven through the Valley hundreds of times over the years. The weather was fine. But the higher they drove, the more slippery the road became. Rounding a sharp U-turn, Andersen saw a heavy truck off the road and immediately hit his brakes. In a minute, the car was going at 25 miles per hour down the mountain before falling down from a ten-foot dam into the extremely cold Logan River. The crash had broken a few windows, and within seconds, the car was filled with water. \\"It was frightening that we were going fast into deep water,\\" remembers Andersen, a soft-spoken manager. Having lost all sense of direction, Andersen began to search the freezing water for the kids. Mia had been right next to him in the front seat; now, in the blackness, he couldn't find her. \\"I thought, if I don't get out, maybe none of us are going to get out.\\" Andersen got out of his seat belt, swam through a broken window, and, deeply and quickly, breathed air at the surface.

Dizzy Gillespie played what instrument????","output":"Dizzy Gillespie, born on October 21, 1917, in Cheraw, South Carolina, was an American jazz musician who primarily played the trumpet, solidifying his place in history as one of the greatest trumpet players of all time. His real name was John Birks Gillespie, but he was affectionately known as \\"Dizzy\\" due to his playful and energetic stage presence. Gillespie made a name for himself in the 1940s as a pioneer of bebop, a new, innovative, and fast-paced style of jazz that transformed the music world. His work alongside other legendary jazz musicians, such as Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, and Bud Powell, helped push the boundaries of jazz and shape it into the complex and captivating genre we know today. Apart from the trumpet, Gillespie also played the piano, an instrument he grew up with and used to accompany his trumpet playing. However, he is most famously known for his unique trumpet, which had its bell pointed upwards at a 45-degree angle. This bent trumpet wasn't just an aesthetic choice; it provided a particular sound, mainly due to the angle at which the sound waves were projected. The story goes that his trumpet got damaged accidentally during a birthday party, but Gillespie liked the sound difference and had a custom trumpet made based on this accident. Dizzy Gillespie's remarkable skills, innovative techniques, and musical virtuosity allowed him to play complex and rapid melodies that were difficult for most musicians. As a skilled improviser, he could weave intricate harmonies into his solos, making him a highly sought-after musician in the jazz world. One of Gillespie's most significant contributions to jazz was his fusion of Afro-Cuban rhythms with bebop, creating a new subgenre called Afro-Cuban jazz or Latin jazz. Some of Dizzy Gillespie's notable works include \\"A Night in Tunisia,\\" \\"Manteca,\\" \\"Groovin' High,\\" and \\"Salt Peanuts.\\" He was not only an incredibly talented musician but a charismatic bandleader and influential composer as well. In 1989, Gillespie received the National Medal of Arts from President George H.W. Bush and was honored with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989. Throughout his career, Gillespie mentored and inspired many young musicians, passing on his knowledge and passion for jazz to future generations. Dizzy Gillespie passed away on January 6, 1993, but his influence and contributions to jazz continue to be celebrated and revered to this day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Contrary to how the Protestant Reformers were often characterized, the concept of a catholic or universal Church was not brushed aside during the Protestant Reformation. On the contrary, the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation. The Magisterial reformers, such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli, believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church, which they viewed as having become corrupted. Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation, denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them. In order to justify their departure from the Roman Catholic Church, Protestants often posited a new argument, saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority, only a spiritual, invisible, and hidden church—this notion began in the early days of the Protestant Reformation.

Every year on this day, organizations all over the country celebrate young volunteers, educate young people about how they can help their country, and invite them to participate in service projects. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said, \\"National Youth Service Day honors young volunteers and is an invitation to others to join hands and do our part as Americans.\\" Founded in 1988, NYSD originally took place on a Tuesday. Now the event lasts from Friday until Sunday so that more people can participate in it. More than 200 organizations work together to create thousands of projects each year. Millions of young people across the United States take part in these service projects. Long before the event, people, community groups, schools, and nonprofit organizations think of ways to meet their communities' needs. Then, they plan projects for young volunteers. Projects include bringing food to hungry people, tutoring younger children and helping senior citizens. During the event, young people from the community do things like planting neighborhood gardens and cleaning up local parks. The organizations that contribute to NYSD believe that volunteering and community service are important activities for people of all ages, but especially for young people. Young people who volunteer are more likely to do well in school, vote, and contribute to charities. More important, they help other people and make the world a better place for everyone.

Our protagonist, Yamashita, is an intelligent yet introverted astrophysicist, searching for a solution to save the city. Yamashita is known to have a rare gift: through his dreams, he often uncovers complex mysteries and puzzles that are seemingly impossible to solve. As Yamashita relentlessly dwells in his thoughts, he encounters Mimiko, a teenager afflicted with a severe respiratory condition. Mimiko's family struggles to provide her persistent supply of clean oxygen through inhalers. Knowing that exposure to the polluted air can cause a fatal outcome, Yamashita becomes emotionally connected to Mimiko and her plight, vowing to save her and countless others like her. As Yamashita's curiosity grows, so too does the frequency of his recurring dreams. In the mysterious realm of his dreams, Yamashita begins to uncover pieces of a forgotten technology — ancient machinery that once perpetuated a pollution-free environment. Driven by his mission, Yamashita delves deeper into his dreams, unearthing feasible links between the forgotten technology and a possible solution to the city's air pollution crisis. As Mimiko's health deteriorates, Yamashita's dreams become more vivid and crucial. Within the dreams, he converses with an enigmatic scientist, Dr. Alma, who was a pioneer of the forgotten technology. Together, they dive into the fascinating world of science, where time is a mere illusion, and they commence a daring journey to rediscover the secret machinery and save the city. Meanwhile, in the waking world, Yamashita battles against the manipulative forces controlling the city's energy sources. These powerful individuals are driven by greed and are invested in maintaining an environmentally harmful status quo, as they are profiting from selling inhalers and oxygen cylinders to the inflicted population. As the connection between Yamashita and Dr. Alma in the dream world strengthens, they come closer to recreating the life-saving technology. With the assistance of like-minded allies, Yamashita works tirelessly to create a device that will generate a sustainable supply of clean air for the city. While one epic battle unfolds in the dream world seeking the truth, another occurs in reality, fighting against those who endanger the lives of thousands. In the climax of the film, the two worlds collide, culminating in the activation of the groundbreaking clean-air device. The machine purifies the air and nullifies the pollution, bringing life and vitality back to the city. As the oxygen levels soar, Mimiko's health drastically improves. As she takes deep, clear breaths, the smile on her face signifies the relief from her lifelong struggle for survival. ‘Dreams of Yamashita’ is a tale of courage and relentless pursuit of knowledge, unraveling the ancient wisdom hidden in the recesses of our dreams.

Initially it was known as Bodhisattvayāna (the \\"Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas\\"). Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism, and therefore each bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia, and the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism. Therefore Mahāyāna was never a separate rival sect of the early schools.

Information:  - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - Labrus is a genus of wrasses native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean into the Mediterranean and Black seas .  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object.

Sarah had a bachelor's degree in microbiology and Katrina had a PhD, so  Select from the following. (I) Sarah had an easy time finding a cure for the disease on the proficiency test.; (II) Katrina had an easy time finding a cure for the disease on the proficiency test.;","output":"Katrina had an easy time finding a cure for the disease on the proficiency test. Despite the fact that both Sarah and Katrina were educated professionals in the field of microbiology, their level of expertise varied greatly due to the differences in their respective degrees. While Sarah possessed a bachelor's degree in the subject matter, Katrina had pursued her studies further to earn a PhD, signifying a more advanced understanding of the field and its complexities. In the realm of microbiology, individuals with higher degrees are often better equipped to tackle challenging tasks involving research and development. Their advanced education and extensive experience enable them to develop a broader understanding and deeper insights into the subject matter, allowing for more informed and sound decision-making processes. Additionally, those who have earned a PhD in the field have usually conducted original research or participated in groundbreaking projects, ultimately positioning them as experts in their area of study. In light of these factors, when faced with the task of finding a cure for a disease as part of a proficiency test, Katrina was understandably more prepared for the challenge. Her experience and education provided an arsenal of knowledge and problem-solving strategies to draw upon, which undoubtedly aided her in efficiently identifying the disease's root cause and developing a potential cure. On the other hand, Sarah's bachelor's degree in microbiology, although a significant accomplishment, did not afford her the extensive and detailed understanding afforded to those with a PhD. Furthermore, the proficiency test was likely designed to assess the participants' suitability for more advanced positions or research roles, which would favor a candidate of Katrina's caliber. Despite Sarah's initial struggles in finding a cure on the proficiency test, she possessed the fundamental knowledge required to make informed decisions and used her skills to work towards a solution. This demonstrates the importance of continued learning and remaining dedicated to one's field of study. With time, effort, and potentially pursuing higher education, Sarah may be able to further refine her skills and become a more effective microbiologist. In conclusion, it was Katrina who had an easy time finding a cure for the disease on the proficiency test, primarily due to her advanced education and the wealth of experience she had gained as a result of her PhD. While Sarah is undoubtedly a talented and capable professional in her own right, furthering her education and gaining additional experiences would undoubtedly enhance her proficiency in the field and allow her to tackle such challenging tasks with more ease in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The major atmospheric contaminants (MAC) and related pollutants that contribute to this issue include: 1. Sulfur dioxide (SO2): Sulfur dioxide is released primarily from the burning of fossil fuels containing sulfur, such as coal and oil, and other industrial processes, such as metal smelting. SO2 can have severe effects on human health, including respiratory issues, and can contribute to the formation of acid rain, which can damage vegetation, water sources, and soil fertility. 2. Nitrogen oxides (NOx): Nitrogen oxides are a group of gases, including nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formed primarily from high-temperature combustion processes like those in automobiles and power plants. NOx emissions contribute to the formation of smog, acid rain, eutrophication of water bodies, and the depletion of the ozone layer. They can also have adverse effects on human health, particularly on the respiratory system. 3. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs): VOCs are a broad group of organic chemicals that can evaporate at room temperature, entering the atmosphere. They are found in various sources, including gasoline, solvents, paints, plastics, and natural sources like plants. When VOCs react with other air pollutants, such as NOx, they can form ground-level ozone, a component of smog, which can have significant effects on human health and the environment. Additionally, some VOCs are classified as hazardous air pollutants due to their potential to cause cancer or other serious health effects. 4. Particulate matter (PM): Particulate matter is a mix of microscopic solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air. These particles can have a range of sizes and compositions, including dust, soot, smoke, and aerosols. Particulate matter can have severe impacts on human health, particularly within the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, and can also contribute to reduced visibility, leading to poor air quality. 5. Ground-level ozone (O3): Unlike the protective ozone layer in the Earth's upper atmosphere, ground-level ozone occurs close to the Earth's surface, formed when pollutants like VOCs and NOx react in the presence of sunlight. Breathing ozone can aggravate existing respiratory conditions, such as asthma, and contribute to other health issues. 6. Carbon monoxide (CO): Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and toxic gas produced primarily from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. High levels of carbon monoxide can lead to poisoning, which can be fatal in extreme cases. CO also contributes to ground-level ozone formation and climate change. These atmospheric contaminants and related pollutants are responsible for a range of negative impacts on the environment and human health. Efforts to mitigate emissions from various sources, implementing regulations, and promoting cleaner technologies and fuels are critical to addressing this ongoing challenge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A substring is a sequence of characters in the original string. A common substring is a sequence of characters that exists in both strings A and B. Now let's solve the task using the guidelines: 1. Compare each character of string A with each character of string B. 2. If a character matches, check the next characters for a continuous match (common substring). 3. Keep track of the longest common substring found so far. 4. Continue this process for all characters in strings A and B. Here's the process in action: 1. Compare 'e' from string A with all characters in string B. No match found. 2. Compare 'U' from string A with all characters in string B. No match found. 3. Compare 'y' from string A with all characters in string B. A match is found with the 3rd character of string B. Continue to check for common substrings. 4.

Fifteen years later, Sharaman's brother Nizam receives proof that the holy city of Alamut is supplying weapons to Persian enemies, and the princes â Dastan, along with the king's biological sons Tus and Garsiv â are sent to siege and take over Alamut. Dastan and his friends breach into the city on their own, and open a gate letting the Persians in. During the attack, Dastan fights a guard for Alamut's royal family and takes from him a special dagger. Alamut falls to the Persians, but princess Tamina denies the town having any weapon forges. Tus asks her to marry him to unite the two nations, and she only accepts after seeing the dagger in Dastan's possession. During the celebration, Dastan is fooled into presenting a poisoned gown seemingly given to him by Tus to King Sharaman, which fatally burns the king. Garsiv accuses Dastan of being the murderer, and the prince is forced to escape, carrying Tamina along. Tus is appointed king and orders a manhunt on Dastan. While in hiding, Tamina attempts to kill Dastan, and in the struggle the prince discovers the dagger enables its wielder to travel back in time. Dastan then believes that Tus invaded Alamut for the dagger, and decides to confront his brother at the funeral of the king in Avrat. On the way, the two are captured by merchant-bandits led by Sheik Amar, who recognized and attempted to take him back to Persia for the reward money, but they manage to escape. After arriving in Avrat, Dastan tries to convince his uncle Nizam that he was not the cause of his father's death, only to discover the dagger was taken by Tamina. Instead, he notices the burns on Nizam's hands, which indicate he was the one who set up the murder of the King.

Then Bruce gets a shot at anchorman, only to have it underhandedly stolen by Evan Baxter. Obviously not please, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired. Much complaining and griping about God later, Bruce gets a page. After a while he gets tired of it calling, so he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building (heh). There he meets God (Freeman), who is the Boss, Electrician, and Janitor of the building. I found this highly amusing. God is the Boss, the Holy Spirit is the Electrician, and Jesus Christ is the Janitor. Think about it. Boss, obvious. Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running. Janitor, the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left. BRILLIANT. Anyway, Bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met God, but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing God, he starts to believe a bit. Wonder why. Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies. Since this is Hollywood, Bruce obviously eventually smartens up, learns his lesson, and starts using his powers for the good of the world. In the end he cries out for God to take it away and prays that His will be done, not Bruce's. Since it is Jim Carrey, the movie is quite amusing, and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it. The movie is not perfect theology, but for Hollywood, it is definitely a good attempt. Many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging, and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this movie. So, while far from perfect, definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it. Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a view or two) Now, what is this review like? I. negative. II. positive.","output":"This review can be classified as II. positive. Although the reviewer was initially skeptical about the movie and its concept, they found it to be an entertaining and amusing experience with thought-provoking elements. The reviewer praises the performances of Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, and Jennifer Anniston, as well as the director, Tom Shadyac, for their efforts. The review also highlights some clever aspects of the storyline and appreciates the theological undertones, even if it is not perfect. The reviewer acknowledges that the movie is far from perfect but describes it as a good popcorn movie with a bit of depth. They give it a rating of 3.5 out of 4, which indicates that they enjoyed the movie and believe it is worth watching at least once or twice. Overall, the tone of the review is positive, as the critic enjoyed the movie despite their initial reservations."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Should you have sex with more than one person? Should a person have sex with more than one person before getting married? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"The two questions, while similar, address different aspects of human relationships and sexual behavior. In order to provide a detailed and comprehensive answer, I will address each question separately. 1. Should you have sex with more than one person? Determining whether one should have sex with more than one person is a highly personal and subjective decision. There is no absolute right or wrong answer to this question, as it depends on an individual's beliefs, values, preferences, and life circumstances. Several factors can influence this decision, such as cultural and religious influences, personal morals, emotional health, and relationship dynamics. It is essential to consider the following points when deciding whether or not to engage in sexual relationships with multiple partners: a) Consent and Communication: Consent is a critical aspect of any sexual relationship. Both partners should openly discuss their intentions, boundaries, and desires to ensure that all parties are on the same page and feel comfortable with the arrangement. b) Emotional Well-being: Engaging in sexual relationships with multiple partners may have emotional implications, both positive and negative. Some people may feel empowered by this lifestyle, while others may experience jealousy, insecurity, or guilt. It's important to reflect on how such relationships may affect your emotional well-being and consider whether this lifestyle aligns with your values and goals. c) Physical Health and Safety: Having sex with multiple partners increases the risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If you decide to engage in sexual relationships with multiple partners, it's crucial to prioritize your health and safety by regularly discussing sexual health with your partners, using protection, and getting tested for STIs. d) Relationship Dynamics: Maintaining healthy, stable, and trusting relationships with multiple partners can be challenging. It's important to consider how this lifestyle may affect your current and future relationships and ensure that all parties involved are open, honest, and respectful of one another. 2. Should a person have sex with more than one person before getting married? Deciding whether or not to have sex with more than one person before getting married is another personal decision, largely influenced by individual beliefs, values, and desires. Some people might consider trying out different relationships important to gain experience and knowledge about oneself and what qualities they value in a long-term partner. However, others may prefer to have a singular, committed relationship without exploring multiple sexual partners, often guided by religious or cultural values. Furthermore, some individuals may be comfortable with the idea of waiting until marriage before engaging in sexual relationships. It is worth considering the following points: a) Personal Beliefs and Values: Reflect on your own values, morals, and beliefs, and determine whether engaging in multiple sexual relationships aligns with your personal convictions. b) Compatibility: For some individuals, having multiple sexual partners allows them to learn about different relationship dynamics and better understand their own preferences. This could potentially lead to a more compatible marriage. c) Emotional Connection: Engaging in sexual relationships requires emotional vulnerability and trust. Building strong emotional connections should be prioritized as it can contribute to a successful long-term relationship. d) Respect for Future Spouses: Some people may consider detailing their sexual history with a future spouse as a sign of respect. In this case, the decision to have multiple sexual partners before marriage should be made with careful consideration to that relationship and future implications. In conclusion, the two questions address different aspects of human relationships and sexual behavior. The first question discusses whether or not an individual should engage in sexual relationships with multiple partners, while the second question focuses on exploring multiple sexual relationships before getting married. Ultimately, the decision to have sex with one or multiple partners should be based on an individual's personal values, experiences, emotional well-being, and consideration of the potential impact on future relationships. It is also essential to prioritize consent, communication, and safety when considering these choices."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. – Doctors examining an 11-month-old baby who was cranky, wailed whenever someone tried to move his legs, and couldn't walk came up with a diagnosis that would've been more likely on an 18th-century ship than in a modern-day clinic. The infant in Spain had scurvy, caused by insufficient vitamin C, and it resulted from the baby consuming only an almond milk-based formula since he was about 3 months old, Live Science reports. The case, documented in the journal Pediatrics, reported that he suffered bone loss, thigh bone fractures, and very low levels of vitamin C. \\"This case demonstrates that scurvy is a new and severe complication of improper use of almond drinks in the first year of life,\\" the researchers write. \\"Plant-based beverages are not a complete food and they may not replace breastfeeding or infant formula,\\" they add. A skin reaction when the baby was around 2.5 months old led a doctor to recommend the switch from a cow-milk formula to another diet. The infant's new staple: the almond formula, which Live Science describes as \\"almond milk, almond flour, sesame powder, and a creamy cereal mixture.\\" The new formula didn't offer vitamin C, which infants need in doses of about 50mg a day—and which is found in breast milk, most baby formulas, and fruits and veggies. Once the baby was 6 months, the mom tried to rotate pureed fruits and veggies into his diet, but he wasn't interested, Live Science notes. Once he was diagnosed, he was pumped full of vitamins C and D—and his symptoms improved and he began to walk. \\"Before you change [a] child's diet, it needs to be changed to a nutritionally adequate diet,\\" a pediatrician at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine tells ABC News. \\"This is too critical a period. Bottom line, stick to breast milk or formula.\\" (This description of 18th-century sailors' scurvy depicts how awful the disease can be.) Expand this summary.","output":"A little baby who was 11 months old was feeling very unwell because he was not getting enough Vitamin C from his food. He was only drinking almond milk since he was 3 months old, which didn't have enough Vitamin C that babies need to grow strong and healthy. This made the baby have a sickness called scurvy, which used to happen mostly to sailors a long time ago. When babies don't get enough Vitamin C, they can have bone loss, weak bones that can break easily, and be very sad when people try to move their legs. Doctors found out the baby had scurvy and gave him lots of Vitamin C and Vitamin D to help him get better. After getting the right vitamins, the baby started feeling better and could even walk. It is important for babies to drink breast milk or special baby formula because they have the right vitamins and nutrients for babies to grow healthy and strong. Changing a baby's food should be done carefully and with the help of a doctor to make sure the little ones are getting everything they need."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The newspaper's founder Joseph Johnson was the union's secretary. He wrote to Henry Hunt asking him to chair a meeting in Manchester on 2 August 1819. Johnson wrote: Nothing but ruin and starvation stare one in the face [in the streets of Manchester and the surrounding towns], the state of this district is truly dreadful, and I believe nothing but the greatest exertions can prevent an insurrection. Oh, that you in London were prepared for it. Unknown to Johnson and Hunt, the letter was intercepted by government spies and copied before being sent to its destination. The contents were interpreted to mean that an insurrection was being planned, and the government responded by ordering the 15th Hussars to Manchester.

Background: Benjamin Solomon Carson Sr. (born September 18, 1951) is an American neurosurgeon, author and politician serving as the 17th and current United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development since 2017, under the Trump Administration. Prior to his cabinet position, he was a candidate for President of the United States in the Republican primaries in 2016. Born in Detroit, Michigan, and a graduate of Yale University and the University of Michigan Medical School, Carson has authored numerous books on his medical career and political stances. Context: By ninth grade, the family's financial situation had improved, his mother surprising neighbors by paying cash to buy a new Chrysler car, and the only government assistance they still relied on was food stamps. Carson attended the predominantly black Southwestern High School for ninth through 12th grades, graduating third in his class academically. In high school he played the baritone horn in the band, and participated in forensics (public speaking), chess club, and the U.S. Army Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) program where he reached its highest rank--cadet colonel. Carson served as a laboratory assistant in the high school's biology, chemistry, physics school laboratories beginning in 10th, 11th, and 12th grade, respectively, and worked as a biology laboratory assistant at Wayne State University the summer between 11th and 12th grades.  In his book Gifted Hands, Carson relates that as a youth he had a violent temper. \\"As a teenager, I would go after people with rocks, and bricks, and baseball bats, and hammers,\\" Carson told NBC's Meet the Press in October 2015. He said he once tried to hit his mother on the head with a hammer over a clothing dispute, while in the ninth grade he tried to stab a friend who had changed the radio station. Fortunately, the blade broke in his friend's belt buckle. Carson said that the intended victim, whose identity he wants to protect, was a classmate, a friend, or a close relative. After this incident, Carson said that he began reading the Book of Proverbs and applying verses on anger. As a result, he states he \\"never had another problem with temper\\". In his various books and at campaign events, he repeated these stories and said he once attacked a schoolmate with a combination lock. Nine friends, classmates, and neighbors who grew up with him told CNN in 2015 they did not remember the anger or violence he has described. In response, Carson posted on Facebook a 1997 Parade Magazine issue, in which his mother verified the stabbing incident. He then questioned the extent of the effort CNN had exerted in the investigation.  He has said that he protected white students in a biology lab after a race riot broke out at his high school in response to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. The Wall Street Journal confirmed the riot but could not find anyone who remembered Carson sheltering white students.

Title: Laura Movie plot: New York City police detective Mark McPherson (Dana Andrews) is investigating the murder of a beautiful and highly successful advertising executive, Laura Hunt (Gene Tierney). Laura has apparently been killed by a shotgun blast to the face, just inside the doorway of her apartment. He first interviews charismatic newspaper columnist Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), an imperious, effete dandy, who relates how he met Laura and became her mentor. She had become his platonic friend and steady companion and he used his considerable fame, influence, and connections to advance her career. McPherson also questions Laura's parasitic playboy fiancÃ©, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a \\"kept man\\" and companion of her wealthy socialite aunt, Ann Treadwell (Judith Anderson). Treadwell is tolerant of her niece's infatuation with Shelby, which appears to be out of her practical acceptance of Shelby's need for the affection of a woman who is his own age. All the while, Treadwell is carrying on with Carpenter and giving him money. Detective McPherson finally questions Laura's loyal housekeeper, Bessie Clary (Dorothy Adams). Through the testimony of her friends, and the reading of her letters and diary, McPherson becomes obsessed with Laura, so much so that Lydecker finally accuses him of falling in love with the dead woman. He also learns that Lydecker was jealous of Laura's suitors, using his newspaper column and influence to keep them at bay. One night, the detective falls asleep in Laura's apartment, under her portrait, and is awakened by the sound of someone entering the apartment. He is shocked to discover it is Laura, who finds a dress in her closet belonging to one of her models, Diane Redfern. McPherson concludes that Redfern was the victim, brought there by Carpenter, while Laura was away in the country. Now it becomes even more urgent to unmask the murderer. A party is thrown to welcome Laura's return. At the party, McPherson arrests Laura for the murder of Diane Redfern. Upon questioning her, he is convinced that...

В Авазе стоимость комнаты составляет от 50 долларов в день и выше. Translate to English","output":"In Avaza, the cost of a room starts from 50 dollars per day and higher. Avaza is a seaside resort and tourist destination located on the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea, in Turkmenistan. It's known for its sandy beaches, luxurious hotels, and modern tourist facilities, making it a popular choice for both local and foreign tourists. Translating the sentence, it means that the minimum price for a room in Avaza is 50 US dollars per day. This probably refers to the simplest or the most basic accommodation option, with more luxurious or spacious rooms or suites costing significantly more.  Generally, hotel and resort pricing can vary widely depending on various factors. For instance, the season or time of the year can significantly affect prices, with peak travel periods like holidays often having higher rates compared to off-peak seasons. The location of the hotel within Avaza could also influence the price, with properties located closer to the beach or to popular attractions often costing more. Additionally, the specific amenities and services provided by the hotel, like a private balcony, a sea view, or a personal hot tub, could also add to the costs. These are just general principles, and actual prices can vary from hotel to hotel. Therefore, for exact rates, it's often best to check directly with the particular hotel or resort, or to use an online booking site which can provide up-to-date prices and available deals or discounts.  It's also worth noting that while the cost per room gives a good indication of the price of accommodation, there might be other costs as well when staying at a hotel. These can include taxes and service charges, meals if not included with the room price, parking fees, charges for using certain facilities like the spa or gym, and so on. Therefore, when budgeting for a trip, it's also important to take these potential additional costs into account.  Also, guests can consider other accommodation options apart from hotels. For instance, there might be vacation rentals or guesthouses available which can offer a more affordable or more flexible alternative for travelers."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. Question: Why did the author change his views about what was the best representation of himself? Answer: Answer:","output":"The author changed his views about the best representation of himself after reading Annie Dillard's quote, \\"How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives.\\" This quote made the author realize the undeniable truth that their everyday actions, rather than the internal list of self-identifying traits (like being creative, outgoing, having interests in photography and guitar), truly define who they are.

July 11, 2017, 11:11 AM GMT / Updated July 12, 2017, 12:26 AM GMT By Keir Simmons, Rachel Elbaum and Andrew Rafferty      MOSCOW — The Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. during the presidential campaign denied in an exclusive interview with NBC News that she had any connection to the Kremlin and insisted she met with President Donald Trump’s son in 2016 to discuss sanctions between Russia and the U.S., not to hand over information about Hillary Clinton’s campaign.      “I never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton. It was never my intention to have that,” Natalia Veselnitskaya said.      Her account appeared to contradict that of Trump Jr., who said on Sunday that the premise of the meeting was to discuss damaging information on Clinton that the lawyer was offering. When asked how Trump Jr. seemed to have the impression that she had information about the Democratic National Committee, she responded:      “It is quite possible that maybe they were longing for such an information. They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted.”      Related: Trump Jr. Tweets His Emails That Led To Russia Meeting      Trump Jr. has confirmed that the meeting occurred, saying in a statement to The New York Times that he attended \\"a short introductory meeting\\" with the lawyer, where the topic of conversation was primarily about adoption.      On Monday, Trump Jr. seemed to confirm that he had been offered information about Clinton or her campaign but insisted that nothing untoward in the meeting had occurred.      “Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent... went nowhere but had to listen,” he tweeted, seemingly sarcastic.      The New York Times on Monday reported that Trump Jr. was told in an email before the meeting that the information Veselnitskaya had was part of a Russian government effort to help his father’s candidacy. On Tuesday, Trump Jr. tweeted his email chain showing him making plans to meet with her — and confirming the Times report.      The email exchange shows an acquaintance with ties to Russia, music publicist Rob Goldstone, telling the son of then-candidate Trump last year that the attorney had “information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.”      But Veselnitskaya, speaking to NBC News prior to Trump Jr. releasing the emails, flatly denied any connection to the Russian government. Kremlin officials said on Monday that they were unfamiliar with the lawyer.      Veselnitskaya explained she has questioned for many years a story that became the basis for a claim against her client, Russian businessman Denis Katsyv. She sought an investigation by the U.S. Congress into the allegations.      That claim led to a U.S. law called the Magnitsky Act, which enabled the U.S. to impose sanctions on Russian officials accused of human rights violations. The Magnitsky Act also led the Kremlin to ban the adoption of Russian children by Americans at the end of 2012.      Part of the information she put together for her client included details about a company run by a former U.S. citizen. She believes this company didn’t pay taxes in either Russia or the U.S. and may also have made donations to the D.N.C.      These details are what may have sparked the interest of Trump’s campaign, she said.      Related: Ten Times Trump Denied Collusion With Russia      She also said that in the meeting, Trump Jr. asked her just one question.      “The question that I was asked was as follows: whether I had any financial records which might prove that the funds used to sponsor the D.N.C. were coming from inappropriate sources.\\"      Veselnitskaya had no records and said \\"it was never my intention to collect any financial records to that end.\\"      Trump Jr.’s meeting with Veselnitskaya took place on June 9, 2016, two days after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee.      Veselnitskaya described how she had circulated information on \\"the real circumstances behind the Magnitsky Act,\\" to friends and friends of friends, seeking meetings with anyone who could help facilitate testimony before Congress.      \\"I never asked anybody for a particular meeting with Mr. Donald Trump Jr., or with anybody else,\\" she said.      In describing how the meeting came about, Veselnitskaya didn’t name the person who set it up over the phone while she was in New York for work.      She added that she now knows that it was arranged in part by pop-star Emin Agalarov, who appeared in a music video with Trump when the Miss Universe pageant, which Trump owned at the time, was held in Moscow in 2013. She said she has never met Agalarov.      Related: Trump Campaign Meeting Raises Question: Is Collusion Even a Crime?      When Veselnitskaya arrived at Trump Tower for the meeting, which she described as banal, she was met by Goldstone, who had also been involved in the pageant. After entering a board room, she was introduced to Trump Jr.      She described how Trump Jr. ran the meeting, which she said lasted 20-30 minutes. Two other men who she never met by name were also in the room. She said she only realized three days ago who they were after seeing their photos in the news. Those men were Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, and Paul Manafort, who at the time was running the Trump campaign.      “I could recognize the young gentleman who was only present in the meeting for probably the first seven to 10 minutes, and then he stood up and left the room,” she said. “It was Mr. Jared Kushner. And he never came back, by the way.      “And the other individual who was in the same meeting, but all the time he was looking at his phone. He was reading something. He never took any active part in the conversation. That was Mr. Manafort.\\" Midway in the interview, she described Manafort as \\"absent-minded.\\"      Trump Jr.’s newly appointed lawyer, Alan Futerfas, on Monday said “that Don Jr. had no knowledge as to what specific information, if any, would be discussed” in the meeting.      He called the reports “much ado about nothing,” and noted that Veselnitskaya was not a government official and had not been a prosecutor since 2001.      But the email exchange released Tuesday seems to contradict Futerfas' claim that Trump Jr. had no knowledge of what would be discussed in the meeting.      In response to Goldstone offering information about Hillary Clinton that he said would be incriminating. Trump Jr. responded, “I love it,” the emails show. Later in the exchange, Goldstone wrote, “This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.\\"      Trump Jr. said he was releasing the exchange “to be totally transparent.” But an editor for The New York Times said the emails were made public by Trump Jr. after he was informed the paper was publishing a story about them.      Veselnitskaya described how difficult the past few days have been since the story broke.      “Imagine yourself in my shoes. One morning you wake up and all of a sudden you are the focus of all the high ranking, upstream media of the world,” she said.      “To summarize, those were not the happiest days of my life, I have to say. I have to break up my holiday. I have to take a trip back to Moscow, because I just wanted to be able to answer the questions myself.”      CORRECTION (July 11, 2017, 10:45 a.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the name of Veselnitskaya's client. It is Denis Katsyv, not Kadsyv.      Keir Simmons reported from Moscow, and Rachel Elbaum from London. ||||| Rob Goldstone, the man who says he connected Donald Trump Jr. with a Russian lawyer who claimed to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton, is a British-born music producer with ties to a Russian billionaire through his pop star son.      Trump Jr. confirmed in a statement that he and other Trump campaign officials met with Natalia Veselnitskaya in June 2016. The president’s son on July 11 released an email chain between himself and Goldstone that raised further questions about the meeting.      In one email, Goldstone, the British-born music producer facilitating the meeting, wrote, “This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump…” Trump Jr. responded, “If it’s what you say, I love it.”      The person who asked Trump Jr. to attend the meeting was Goldstone, a music producer with ties to a Russian pop star named Emin Agalarov, according to The Washington Post.      Rob Goldstone very much likes his hats pic.twitter.com/44yUnMu8CE — Allan Smith (@akarl_smith) July 10, 2017      The New York Times broke the story that Trump Jr., Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort had attended the meeting, although Trump Jr. says Veselnitskaya never produced information negative to Clinton.      A special prosecutor is investigating whether members of the Trump campaign colluded with Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election. Goldstone is a colorful addition to the cast of characters in the Trump/Russia controversies.      Here’s what you need to know:      1. The Emails Reveal Goldstone Told Trump Jr. That Veselnitskaya Was a Government Lawyer With Information Damaging to Hillary Clinton      In the statement that he released on the meeting, Trump Jr. did not name the intermediary. However, Rob Goldstone told The Washington Post that “he had arranged the meeting at request of a Russian client and had attended it along with Veselnitskaya.”      He initially wouldn’t identify the Russian client, according to The Post, but he said that Veselnitskaya wanted to speak with Trump Jr. about Russian adoptions.      Goldstone later released a statement, in which he alleged Veselnitskaya had said she had information about illegal campaign contributions to the DNC. He has now identified the “client” as Russian pop star Emin Agalarov.      Just into @CNN, Rob Goldstone, music publicist who set up mtg bw Trump Jr and Veselnitzkaya, says Trump \\"halted\\" talk when Magnitzky came up pic.twitter.com/ysDZVMm1Bj — David Shortell (@davidgshortell) July 10, 2017      The New York Times is now reporting that Goldstone allegedly sent an email to Trump Jr. before the meeting informing him “that the material was part of a Russian government effort to aid his father’s candidacy.”      Trump Jr. then released all of the emails himself. On June 3, in one key exchange, Goldstone wrote, “Good morning. Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting. The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump – helped along by Aras and Emin. What do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly?”      In his own statement, Donald Trump Jr. wrote that he was “asked to have a meeting by an acquaintance I knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant with an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign.” The Times reported that Trump Jr. accused the lawyer of being a “Kremlin proxy.”      Veselnitskaya told The New York Times in a statement to the newspaper that “nothing at all about the presidential campaign” was discussed at the meeting and said she has “never acted on behalf of the Russian government” and “never discussed any of these matters with any representative of the Russian government.”      Trump Jr. also says in the statement that he was told that Veselnitskaya “had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Mrs. Clinton.”      You can release the Trump Jr. emails with Goldstone here:      2. Goldstone Works With a Russian Pop Star Whose Father Is a Wealthy Developer in Moscow      According to The Post, Goldstone “works as a manager for Emin Agalarov, a Russian pop star whose father is a wealthy Moscow developer who sponsored the pageant in the Russian capital in 2013.”      Trump was featured in a music video with Emin Agalarov.      Emin’s father is Aras Agalarov, a Russian billionaire. Forbes says Aras is worth almost 2 billion, a fortune he made from real estate, and added that he brought the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow. According to Bloomberg, “The last time Donald Trump made an appearance in Moscow was November 2013 for the Miss Universe contest he famously owned.”      According to The New York Times, “The elder Agalarov boasts close ties to Mr. Putin: his company has won several large state building contracts, and Mr. Putin awarded him the “Order of Honor of the Russian Federation.”      The son has boasted of the family’s ties to Trump.      Ermin Agalarov told Forbes in an interview that “he and his billionaire developer father, Aras, had plans to build a Trump Tower in Russia that would now likely be under construction had Trump not run for office; that he has maintained contact with the Trump family since the election, and has exchanged messages with Donald Trump Jr. as recently as January; and that President Trump himself sent a handwritten note to the Agalarovs in November after they congratulated him on his victory.”      Politico has called Aras Agalarov “a billionaire Russian real estate mogul with ties to Putin,” and described Emin as “a dance-pop singer with ambitions to international stardom who got Trump to appear in one of his music videos.”      Bloomberg reported that, while Trump was in Moscow, he was invited to meet with “more than a dozen of Russia’s top businessmen, including Herman Gref, the chief executive officer of state-controlled Sberbank PJSC, Russia’s biggest bank.” Gref, “who was President Vladimir Putin’s economy minister from 2000 to 2007, organized the meeting together with Aras Agalarov, the founder of Crocus Group, one of the country’s largest real-estate companies, which was hosting the beauty pageant at one of its concert halls,” reported Bloomberg.      3. Goldstone Is a Former Journalist From the UK & Has Represented Many Famous Clients      Goldstone got his start in journalism and runs a PR firm. He has a penchant for profane and colorful hats that he displays frequently on social media.      “Oui 2 PR founder, Rob Goldstone is a former journalist, publicist and international marketing director, whose previous clients include Michael Jackson, BB King, HMV Record Stores, Richard Branson, The Hard Rock Cafe and Oscar-winning lyricist Tim Rice,” his bio says.      “Born in the United Kingdom, Rob studied as a journalist and by his early 20’s worked for daily newspapers and radio stations. In 1985, The Band Aid Relief Fund invited Rob to accompany Bob Geldof to Ethiopia.”      The New York Times referred to Goldstone as a former “tabloid journalist,” writing that he is “a former British tabloid journalist and the president of a company called Oui 2 Entertainment who has worked with the Miss Universe pageant.”      The bio continues, “In 1986, Rob moved to Australia, first as a journalist – as the only journalist chosen by Michael Jackson to accompany him on his tour “down under” – and later as a publicist and co-president of his own PR company, Crawford Goldstone Publicity. For six years, Sydney-based Rob represented almost every major international artist touring Australia; from Cyndi Lauper to Julio Iglesias, James Taylor, Tracy Chapman, BB King, Marianne Faithful and Poison! Among his corporate clients were Saatchi and Saatchi, The Hard Rock Cafe, Chess: The Musical, Richard Branson’s Virgin Megastores, and HMV Music Stores.”      The Oui 2 company bio for Goldstone says he founded Oui 2 Entertainment with David Wilson in 1998.      “Manhattan-based Oui 2 and has since gone on to represent some of the biggest music brands and entertainment events in the country, including a decade relationship with EMI Music Publishing (then the world’s largest music publisher), Best Buy (handling their PR and creating events to introduce them into New York and San Francisco including Sting in Central Park), The Friars Club (handling media for their Roasts and tributes),” the bio says.      4. Goldstone Was in Moscow Two Weeks Before the Meeting      Goldstone has since privatized his Instagram account, but a July 27, 2016 post read, “It’s the last full day in Russia today and it’s been a 3 week whirlwind between Baku, St. Petersburg and Moscow.”      Trump Jr. associate Rob Goldstone was in Moscow less than 2 weeks before the June 9 meeting at Trump Tower, then went back for most of July: pic.twitter.com/GxLRiDwK9I — Jon Swaine (@jonswaine) July 10, 2017      He also posted from Red Square in May 2016.

I rest my case.”      On Facebook, Goldstone says that he is single, lives in New York, New York, and is from Manchester, United Kingdom. His most recent public Facebook posts show travels to Greece, Croatia, and Italy.      5. Trump Jr. Admits Meeting With Veselnitskaya but Says She Had ‘No Meaningful Information’      According to a statement released by Trump Jr., he was not told the lawyer’s name before the meeting and asked Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort to attend “but told them nothing of the substance.”      The meeting occurred in June 2016, and Veselnitskaya “stated that she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton. Her statements were vague, ambiguous and made no sense.”      JUST IN: Donald Trump Jr. responds to reports that he met with Kremlin-linked lawyer during campaign pic.twitter.com/5mqRX38Wio — NBC News (@NBCNews) July 9, 2017      She didn’t provide details or supporting information and “it quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information. She then changed subjects and began discussing the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act.”      Trump Jr. said it became clear to him that “this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting.”      Trump Jr. released another statement on July 11. It reads,      To everyone, in order to be totally transparent, I am releasing the entire email chain of my emails with Rob Goldstone about the meeting on June 9, 2016. The first email on June 3, 2016 was from Rob, who was relating a request from Emin, a person I knew from the 2013 Ms. Universe Pageant near Moscow. Emin and his father have a very highly respected company in Moscow. The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was Political Opposition Research. I first wanted to just have a phone call but when that didn’t work out, they said the woman would be in New York and asked if I would meet. I decided to take the meeting. The woman, as she has said publicly, was not a government official. And, as we have said, she had no information to provide and wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act. To put this in context, this occurred before the current Russian fever was in vogue. As Rob Goldstone said just today in the press, the entire meeting was the “most inane nonsense I ever heard. And I was actually agitated by it.”      Trump Jr. originally said only that the meeting dealt with adoptions, according to The New York Times.      In a statement, a spokesman for President Trump’s outside counsel said Veselnitskaya misrepresented herself and alluded to ties to Democrats.      “We have learned from both our own investigation and public reports that the participants in the meeting misrepresented who they were and who they worked for,” Mark Corallo, spokesperson for Trump’s outside counsel, said in a statement. “Specifically, we have learned that the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS, a firm which according to public reports, was retained by Democratic operatives to develop opposition research on the president and which commissioned the phony Steele dossier.” |||||Summary:","output":"A Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, met with Donald Trump Jr during the presidential campaign to talk about sanctions between Russia and the US, not to give information about Hillary Clinton's campaign, she said in an exclusive interview with NBC News. Veselnitskaya flatly denied any Kremlin connection and said she had hoped to testify before Congress with regard to the Magnitsky Act, a US law that imposes sanctions on Russian officials accused of human rights violations. This contradicts Trump Jr's statement that he attended the meeting on the premise of disclosing damaging information on Clinton."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Pick one category for the following text.

Nathan","output":"Title: Unraveled Fate Step 1: Introducing the setting and main characters The movie is set in a small, tight-knit town called Bramblewood. Our protagonists are Annie, a kind-hearted school teacher, and Nathan, a diligent and responsible police officer. They both bring joy and support to the people around them. However, they have not had significant interactions with each other. Step 2: Establishing the inciting incident One day, while driving home after night school, Annie gets involved in a car accident at a remote intersection in the outskirts of the town. Nathan, the responding officer to the scene, quickly arrives and tends to Annie. He ensures that she receives proper medical care, and they develop a bond due to their shared experience in the aftermath of the accident.  Step 3: Developing the main storyline As the investigation of the accident progresses, Nathan starts to uncover some inconsistencies in what initially seemed like a straightforward hit and run case. The accident appears to be intentional and orchestrated, making it a potential attempt on Annie's life. The narrative now focuses on unravelling the mystery surrounding the accident. Step 4: Introducing subplots and character development During their interactions, Nathan and Annie learn more about each other, the hardships they have faced, and their subsequent resilience. Annie's painful past, which involved her late husband, gradually emerges. Her husband was involved in criminal activities that left vengeful figures in his wake. Nathan, who has been healing from the loss of his partner in the line of duty, finds solace in their deepening relationship. Step 5: Building tension and conflict As Nathan starts connecting the dots, the conspirators behind the accident become more desperate in their attempts to silence Annie. Threats against her life are escalated, putting both her and Nathan in danger. Nathan becomes more determined to protect Annie, even if it means jeopardizing his career. Step 6: Climax Nathan manages to identify the mastermind behind the accident— a former associate of Annie's late husband. The climax sees Nathan in a high-intensity confrontation with the perpetrator, who, in the end, confesses and gets apprehended.  Step 7: Resolution As the movie draws to an end, Annie comes to terms with her past and accepts her role in exposing her husband's criminal organization. Meanwhile, Nathan receives recognition and commendation for his work on the case. The two protagonists decide to face their future together, building a new life in Bramblewood, side by side. Step 8: Closing scene The closing scene showcases Annie and Nathan at the same intersection where the accident had occurred, but this time, they share a heartfelt moment, symbolizing their triumph over adversity.

During the 1999 Russian Presidential elections, the two leading candidates are Igor Komarov, a former Colonel of the KGB, and Nikolai Nikolayev, a retired General of the Russian Army. When a car bomb explodes outside one of Komarov's pharmaceutical companies, and a virus is stolen from inside, an investigation by the FSB ensues headed by FSB agents Sonia Astrova and Andrei Kasanov. Their investigation is obstructed by the Director of the FSB, Anatoly Grishin. A British Embassy worker from Moscow, Sir Nigel Irvine, tracks down Jason Monk, a former CIA operative, who ran double agents in the Soviet Union and convinces him to investigate the incident. Once in Moscow, Jason finds an old friend, Viktor Akopov, who agrees to hide Jason from Komarov's men. Viktor steals a residue sample of the bomb used and his scientist friend Tonkin tells him that the explosive used, Semtex H, has a direct traceable link to the FSB. Tonkin is soon killed by Vladimir Dorganosov, the man who attacked Komarov industries and stole the bioweapon. Sonia and Andrei locate Leonid Zaitzev, a cleaner who worked at the Komarov Industries plant and saw Dorganosov steal the virus. As they question him, Grishin appears, arrests Zaitzev and fires Sonia and Andrei. Zaitzev is later killed by Dorganosov while in custody. Sonia goes home to find Jason waiting for her, and agrees to help him access the FSB network. However, they are shot at by Dorganosov, and a car chase ensues.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew  Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Given the question: I can use this background: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.

Your job is to write questions that evaluate one's understanding of such references. Good questions are expected to link pronouns (she, her, him, his, their, etc.) or other mentions to people, places, or things to which they may refer. Do not ask questions that can be answered correctly without understanding the paragraph or having multiple answers. Avoid questions that do not link phrases referring to the same entity.

Q: Passage: The album was originally set to be released on 29 June 2010, but in May M.I.A.'s record label announced a new release date of 13 July. In late April, the artist posted a twitpic of the track listing for the new album. She also commented that at the time she was \\"open to suggestions\\" regarding the album's title. Two weeks later, a blog posting on her record label's official website revealed that the album would be entitled ///Y/, the punctuation marks spelling Maya, M.I.A.'s own forename. The title follows on from previous albums named after her father (2005's Arular) and mother (2007's Kala). Some reviewers used the stylised title while others did not. M.I.A.'s official Myspace page uses both titles. The album was released in conventional physical and digital formats and as an iTunes LP.The album's cover features the singer's face almost completely hidden by YouTube player bars. MTV's Kyle Anderson described the cover, which was previewed in June 2010, as \\"a typically busy, trippy, disorienting piece of art\\" and speculated that it might be \\"a statement about 21st century privacy\\". Additional art direction for the album was provided by Aaron Parsons. M.I.A. used her mother's Tamil phonebook to find a wedding photographer to provide images for the album. Photographers for the album were Ravi Thiagaraja, M.I.A. and Jamie Martinez. Elements of the artwork had previously been used in one of a series of billboard images, all designed by musicians, which were projected onto landmarks in London by a guerrilla project called BillBored during the 2010 British general election. The deluxe edition of the album features a lenticular slipcase. Music website Prefix listed it as one of the 10 worst album covers of 2010, likening it to a \\"child's first computer-class-assignment\\".When questioned about the difficulty of finding her album title on search engines such as Google, she noted that she chose to use forward slashes and backward slashes due to their ease at being typed and because she liked the way the album title looked on music players such as iTunes. She also suggested that it was a deliberate attempt to avoid detection by internet search engines. The Guardian's Sian Rowe commented that M.I.A.'s deliberate \\"shrinking away from a mainstream audience\\" by the use of difficult, unsearchable symbols was part of a growing new underground scene perhaps trying to create a \\"generation gap\\", where only \\"the youngest and the most enthusiastic\\" would seek out such band names by reading the right online sources. A:","output":"Part 1: Writing questions that evaluate one's understanding of references to people, places, or things within the passage. Usage: Q: Who does the title ///Y/ reference? A: The title references Maya, M.I.A.'s own forename. This meets the criteria because it asks about a specific reference within the passage, linking the title to the name Maya. Part 2: Ensuring that questions cannot be answered correctly without understanding the paragraph or have multiple answers. Usage: Q: What were the major themes of the album's cover art? A: The cover art was described as \\"typically busy, trippy, disorienting,\\" reflecting possible themes of the 21st century privacy. This meets the criteria because a correct answer requires an understanding of the passage's description and specific details about the cover art. Part 3: Avoiding questions that do not link phrases referring to the same entity. Usage: Q: Who provided additional art direction for the album? A: Aaron Parsons provided additional art direction. This example meets the criteria because it links both the phrase \\"additional art direction\\" and the person, Aaron Parsons, who was responsible for it. Part 4: Making sure the answer to each question is unambiguous. Usage: Q: In which year did M.I.A.'s record label announce a new release date? A: 2010. This meets the criteria because the answer is unambiguous, and the only year mentioned in this context is 2010."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They are absorptive feeders, found on decaying organic matter. They resemble fungi and reproduce with spores as fungi do. Examples of fungus-like protists include slime molds and water molds.   Q: How do fungus-like protists such as slime molds reproduce?   A: Answer:","output":"Fungus-like protists, such as slime molds, reproduce through the production and dispersal of spores. These spores are small, reproductive cells that can develop into a new organism when they land on a suitable substrate, such as decaying organic matter. When conditions are favorable for growth, the spores germinate, and the protist begins to grow and feed on the surrounding nutrients. Eventually, it will undergo a reproductive process, creating new spores, which are then released into the environment to continue the life cycle."},{"instruction":"You are presented with the question \\"Cutting down what has a negative impact on living communities?\\" and the following answer choices:  - bushes  - on calories  - habitat  - manmade structures  - invasive species  - disease  - bamboo  - trees  Now knowing that cutting down trees has a negative impact on an ecosystem and ecosystems are living communities, choose the best answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: The Spy Who Loved Me      In her 20s, Avril Haines held erotica readings at the Baltimore bookstore and restaurant she co-owned at the time. Ben Jacobs and Avi Zenilman report.      The former host of “Erotica Night” at a Baltimore bookstore will be the first-ever female No. 2 official at the CIA.      On Wednesday, Barack Obama nominated Avril Danica Haines to be the deputy director of the CIA, replacing Michael Morell, who twice served as acting director of the agency but took much of the blame for editing the highly controversial talking points around the 2012 attack on the consulate in Benghazi. As a lawyer in the White House Counsel’s office, Haines oversaw the approval process for the CIA's covert actions, acting as a vital link between the CIA and the president.      But 20 years ago, Haines opened and co-owned Adrian’s Book Café in the Baltimore waterfront neighborhood of Fells Point. She opened Adrian’s after dropping out of a graduate program in physics at Johns Hopkins University. The store featured regular “Erotica Nights.” including dinner and a series of readings by guests of published work or their own prose, according to a 1995 report in the Baltimore Sun; couples could attend for 30, while singles paid 17.      \\"Erotica has become more prevalent because people are trying to have sex without having sex. Others are trying to find new fantasies to make their monogamous relationships more satisfying,” Haines, then in her 20s, told the Sun. “What the erotic offers is spontaneity, twists and turns. And it affects everyone.\\" (She also told Baltimore Sun reporter Mary Corey that friends heckled “you just want a mass orgy in your bookstore, while she and her co-owner were initially worried only \\"dirty old men\\" would show up.)      The event Corey attended at the bookstore featured a room lit with red candles where guests held chicken tostadas, waiting to eat as Haines read aloud the opening pages of The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, by Anne Rice writing under the pseudonym A.N. Roquelaire, which features passages such as:      “He mounted her, parting her legs, giving the white inner flesh of her thighs a soft deep pinch, and, clasping her right breast in his hand, he thrust his sex into her.      He was holding her up as he did this, to gather her mouth to him, and as he broke through her innocence, he opened her mouth with his tongue and pinched her breast sharply.”      But her bookstore was hardly defined by erotica (which was shelved between self-help and parenting), stocking titles from a variety of smaller publishing houses and local authors, and offering a café. Haines was also well respected in the close-knit waterfront neighborhood of Fells Point, according to former neighbors.      One of them, long-time neighborhood fixture Steve Bunker, who has since retired to Maine, raved about Haines to The Daily Beast, saying “She’s brilliant, has a genius IQ, is easy to work with, and reliable.” He recalled going to New Year’s Eve parties with her at the 22 million dollar townhouses then owned by her father, Dr. Thomas Haines, a liberal activist and noted chemist, on the Upper West Side of New York.      Another property owner in the neighborhood, Howard Barstop, raved about Haines’ work ethic, reminiscing about when she would rehab her apartment in “jeans or a pair of shorts.”      At an agency recently rocked by revelations about then-Director David Petraeus’s secret erotic emails while having an affair with his biographer, Haines’s bookstore past seems considerably more appealing, and about as racy as what a reader might find in a Lewis Libby or Jim Webb novel.       ||||| The C.I.A.’s deputy director, Michael J. Morell, is retiring after 33 years at the agency and will be replaced by Avril D. Haines, the top lawyer at the National Security Council, the C.I.A.’s director, John O. Brennan, announced Wednesday.      The switch will put a woman in one of the agency’s top two jobs for the first time. Ms. Haines is an unusual choice because she is not an intelligence professional, though in her two years at the White House she has been deeply involved in intelligence programs and got to know Mr. Brennan when he was President Obama’s counterterrorism adviser.      In April, the president had nominated Ms. Haines to become the legal adviser at the State Department, a job in which she would also have been the first woman. But with Mr. Morell’s departure, he evidently decided to shift her to the C.I.A. post.      The agency’s deputy director is not subject to Senate confirmation.      Mr. Morell, 54, is leaving voluntarily, officials said, after a full career that has included two recent stints as acting director of the spy agency, first after the departure of Leon E. Panetta in 2011 and then after the resignation of David H. Petraeus last year over a sex scandal. He was a leading candidate for the top job, but Mr. Obama chose Mr. Brennan in January, and colleagues said then that Mr. Morell was likely to retire. ||||| Deputy CIA Director Michael Morell is retiring and President Barack Obama has selected a White House lawyer, Avril D. Haines, to replace him at the spy agency.      Morell, 54, who began at the Central Intelligence Agency in 1980 as an analyst, helped draft the administration’s talking points on the attack on diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, Libya. He will become a member of the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board, the White House said in a statement.      Taking over the job is Haines, 43, who has been deputy counsel to the president for national security affairs since 2010, marking the first time a woman has ascended to the agency’s second highest position. While she previously worked at the State Department and on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, she does not have a background in intelligence work.      “I am proud that such experienced and committed individuals have agreed to serve the American people in these important roles,” Obama said in a statement. “I look forward to working with them in the months and years ahead.”      With United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice scheduled to become Obama’s national security adviser in July and former adviser Samantha Power nominated to replace Rice at the UN, Obama’s foreign policy team has three women in top positions.      Morell, who served as acting director following the resignation of David Petraeus in November until John Brennan was confirmed as CIA director in March, said he’s leaving to devote more time to his family.      Family Concerns      “Whenever someone involved in the rough and tumble of Washington decides to move on, there is speculation in various quarters about the ‘real reason,’” Morell said in a statement. “But when I say that it is time for my family, nothing could be more real than that.”      Brennan, who was Obama’s counterterrorism adviser before taking over at the CIA, said he’s worked closely with Haines over the past several years. She’s been a regular participant in high-level meetings and headed a group of lawyers that reviews the CIA’s most sensitive programs, he said in a statement.      He also thanked Morell for helping him make the transition back to the agency.      Morell, who also was one of President George W. Bush’s intelligence briefers, has come under criticism from Republicans over the Benghazi talking points, which removed any reference to al-Qaeda from the administration’s initial explanation of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.      Talking Points      The talking points were used by Rice on Sunday talk shows to describe the Benghazi attack as growing out of a spontaneous demonstration sparked by a movie trailer that Muslims found offensive to their religion. Republicans have conducted multiple hearings on the administration’s response.      When the Obama administration released almost 100 pages of e-mails about the origins of the talking points last month, administration officials said that they showed that it was Morell, a career CIA employee, who made the final edits to the document.      That chain of authorship allowed the Obama administration to preserve its argument that the White House made only minor edits to a document that originated in the intelligence community.      Final Draft      References to al-Qaeda were removed while the document was still being drafted by the CIA, according to White House officials who briefed reporters. It was eventually replaced with “Islamic extremist,” in the final draft.      Morell didn’t mention the Benghazi controversy in his public notice about his retire.      “I am passionate about two things in this world -- the agency and my family,” he said in a statement emailed to CIA employees. “And while I have given everything I have to the Central Intelligence Agency and its vital mission for a third of a century, it is now time for me to give everything I have to my family.”      To contact the reporter on this story: Hans Nichols in Washington at hnichols2@bloomberg.net      To contact the editor responsible for this story: Steven Komarow at skomarow1@bloomberg.net |||||Summary:","output":"Avril Haines, a former host of \\"Erotica Night\\" at a Baltimore bookstore, has been nominated by Barack Obama to be the deputy director of the CIA, replacing Michael Morell.

Information:  - The National Gallery of Art, and its attached Sculpture Garden, is a national art museum in Washington, D.C., located on the National Mall, between 3rd and 9th Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW. Open to the public and free of charge, the museum was privately established in 1937 for the American people by a joint resolution of the United States Congress. Andrew W. Mellon donated a substantial art collection and funds for construction. The core collection includes major works of art donated by Paul Mellon, Ailsa Mellon Bruce, Lessing J. Rosenwald, Samuel Henry Kress, Rush Harrison Kress, Peter Arrell Brown Widener, Joseph E. Widener, and Chester Dale. The Gallery's collection of paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, sculpture, medals, and decorative arts traces the development of Western Art from the Middle Ages to the present, including the only painting by Leonardo da Vinci in the Americas and the largest mobile created by Alexander Calder.  - Rococo (or ), less commonly roccoco, or \\"Late Baroque\\", is an early to late French 18th-century artistic movement and style, affecting many aspects of the arts including painting, sculpture, architecture, interior design, decoration, literature, music, and theatre. It developed in the early 18th century in Paris, France as a reaction against the grandeur, symmetry, and strict regulations of the previous Baroque style, especially of the Palace of Versailles, until it was redone. Rococo artists and architects used a more jocular, florid, and graceful approach to the Baroque. Their style was ornate and used light colours, asymmetrical designs, curves, and gold. Unlike the political Baroque, the Rococo had playful and witty themes. The interior decoration of Rococo rooms was designed as a total work of art with elegant and ornate furniture, small sculptures, ornamental mirrors, and tapestry complementing architecture, reliefs, and wall paintings.  - Samuel Henry Kress (July 23, 1863  September 22, 1955) was a businessman and philanthropist, founder of the S. H. Kress & Co. five and ten cent store chain. With his fortune, Kress amassed one of the most significant collections of Italian Renaissance and European artwork assembled in the 20th century. In the 1950s and 1960s, a foundation established by Kress would donate 776 works of art from the Kress collection to 18 regional art museums in the United States.  - Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 14522 May 1519), more commonly Leonardo da Vinci or simply Leonardo, was an Italian polymath whose areas of interest included invention, painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography. He has been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture, and is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time. Sometimes credited with the inventions of the parachute, helicopter and tank, he epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal.  - Jean-Honoré Fragonard (4 April 1732  22 August 1806) was a French painter and printmaker whose late Rococo manner was distinguished by remarkable facility, exuberance, and hedonism. One of the most prolific artists active in the last decades of the \\"Ancien Régime\\", Fragonard produced more than 550 paintings (not counting drawings and etchings), of which only five are dated. Among his most popular works are genre paintings conveying an atmosphere of intimacy and veiled eroticism.  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.  - Young Girl Reading , or The Reader ( French : La Liseuse ) , is an 18th - century oil painting by Jean - Honoré Fragonard .

He puts a bottle in the freezer but leaves it in too long so it freezes. Being impatient he then takes the bottle and runs it under soe hot water for a few minutes.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Will the energy of the water molecules in the bottle increase or decrease when Andrew runs hot water on the bottle?  Hint: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds. A:","output":"When Andrew runs hot water on the frozen water bottle, the energy of the water molecules in the bottle will increase. As hinted, changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. In this case, the hot water increases the temperature around the frozen water bottle, thereby transferring heat energy to the ice inside the bottle. As the ice gains energy, the water molecules begin to vibrate and move faster, breaking their bonds with each other, and transitioning from a solid (frozen) state to a liquid state. This process is known as melting. Polar compounds, such as water, have relatively high melting and boiling points due to the additional energy required to overcome the hydrogen bonds between the individual molecules. Consequently, as Andrew runs hot water on the frozen bottle, the energy of the water molecules inside the bottle increases, causing the ice to melt back into liquid water."}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},R=["disabled"],D={key:0},j={key:1};function N(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
