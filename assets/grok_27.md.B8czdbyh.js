Question: I can use this background: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4]  Now, I have a new situation: Two coastal Canadian towns, Hammond and Soundville decided to start sand mining to bring more money to their budgets.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? an engaging storyline , which also is n't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues","output":"The phrase \\"an engaging storyline, which also isn't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues\\" can be considered positive for several reasons. This statement suggests that there are noteworthy qualities to appreciate in the storyline, as well as an emotional element that may resonate with audiences. Let's break down the phrase for a deeper understanding. 1. \\"An engaging storyline\\": The word \\"engaging\\" implies that the storyline is captivating or compelling. This is a positive adjective, as it indicates that the story may hold the audience's interest and keep them invested in the narrative. 2. \\"which also isn't embarrassed\\": The phrase \\"isn't embarrassed\\" suggests that the creators or writers behind the storyline are not ashamed or concerned about integrating an emotional component into the story. This indicates an openness and willingness to evoke strong feelings in the audience, which can be seen as a positive approach to storytelling. 3. \\"to make you reach for the tissues\\": This part of the phrase implies that the storyline has the potential to evoke an emotional response in the audience, perhaps through the portrayal of sensitive or moving situations that can lead to tears. The act of reaching for tissues can be seen as an endearing and relatable human experience, which many viewers appreciate in stories because it makes them feel connected and emotionally invested. In sum, the phrase \\"an engaging storyline, which also isn't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues\\" can be considered positive, as it highlights captivating, emotional storytelling that resonates with viewers. While it mentions tears, the emotional impact of the story adds depth and complexity to the narrative, ultimately contributing to a more wholly satisfying and resonant experience for the audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First question: What is an asset light business model? What are the advantages and disadvantages? Second question: How do low expected returns on financial assets in the coming years affect the viability of Oscar's business model? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. They are two distinct questions. Let me help answer each of them separately. 1. An asset-light business model: An asset-light business model is a business approach where a company minimizes its ownership of capital-intensive assets to reduce fixed costs and improve overall efficiency. This model usually involves outsourcing certain functions such as manufacturing, distribution, or property management, and focusing resources on core competencies such as research, innovation, branding, or customer service. Advantages of an asset-light business model: a. Lower capital investment: Companies with an asset-light model require minimal capital investments to maintain and grow their operations. b. Higher return on assets: Due to lower assets on the books, companies with an asset-light model can generate a higher return on assets, making them more attractive to investors. c. Flexibility: Since these companies don't need to invest heavily in fixed assets, they can be more agile and adapt quickly to market changes. d. Focus on core competencies: Companies can allocate more resources to areas in which they have expertise or a competitive advantage instead of managing the assets. Disadvantages of an asset-light business model: a. Dependence on third parties: Relying on outsourcing partners can lead to reduced control over certain operations, which may result in lower product quality or increased risk. b. Vulnerability to external factors: Companies adopting an asset-light model may be more susceptible to supply chain disruptions, political instability, or other external factors that can affect outsourced operations. c. Lack of strategic assets: In some industries, not owning strategic assets such as production facilities or key distribution channels can put a company at a competitive disadvantage. 2. Low expected returns on financial assets and the viability of Oscar's business model: Without more details about Oscar's business model, it's hard to provide a direct answer. However, I can still discuss how low expected returns on financial assets could potentially affect a business model in general. a. Lower investment income: If Oscar's business model relies on investing in financial assets to generate supplementary income or maintain a healthy reserve, low returns may adversely affect the company's profitability and overall financial health. b. Increased borrowing costs: A low-return environment may influence interest rates, leading to increased borrowing costs for the company if they need to leverage debt for their operations or growth. c. Changes in consumer behavior: Depending on the industry Oscar's business operates in, low returns on financial assets may impact consumers; this could influence their spending patterns, thereby affecting Oscar's revenue and business growth potential. These two questions are different, as the first one asks about the asset light business model and its pros and cons, while the second one is about the potential impacts of low expected returns on financial assets on a business model."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise clearly tells us that there are \\"Asian dancers performing a new dance in front of their class and teacher.\\" This statement aligns with the part of the hypothesis suggesting that \\"a group of Asian [people are] showing off their dancing skills\\".  However, there is a certain amount of information the premise doesn't communicate. The premise restricts the audience to a \\"class and teacher\\", which may not reasonably be interpreted as \\"everyone\\". While the class and teacher may comprise a significant group of people, this does not necessarily equate to displaying their dancing skills to everyone. In this statement, \\"everyone\\" could signify a larger audience, such as all the students at the school, all the people in their community, or even an online audience.  Without additional information about the size and scope of the audience watching the performance beyond just the class and teacher, we lack the necessary details to fully validate the hypothesis. Therefore, we can only affirm that the group of Asian dancers is showing off their dancing skills, but not necessarily to \\"everyone\\".  Moreover, it's worth noting that the phrase \\"showing off\\" in the hypothesis may have a slightly negative connotation, suggesting a desire to impress or outdo others. The premise simply states the dancers are \\"performing a new dance\\", which doesn't necessarily imply showing off. Performance can be for a variety of reasons - practice, assessment, or even just sharing a new dance. Hence, the motive suggested in the hypothesis may not fully align with the information given in the premise. In summary, the given premise does support parts of the hypothesis. It acknowledges a group of Asian dancers performing, which implies the display of dancing skills.

Her forerunner was the radical feminist who interpreted her trapped position as a female as oppression by the master class of men. Men, she believed, had created a domestic, servile role for women in order that men could have the career and the opportunity to participate in making the great decisions of society. Thus the radical feminist held that women through history had been oppressed and dehumanized, mainly because man chose to exploit his wife and the mother of his children. Sometimes it was deliberate exploitation and sometimes it was the innocence of never looking beneath the pretensions of life. The radical feminists found strength in banding together. Coming to recognize each other for the first time, they could explore their own identities, realize their own power, and view the male and his system as the common enemy. The first phases of feminism in the last five years often took on this militant, class-warfare tone. Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer, and many others hammered home their ideas with a persistence that aroused and intrigued many of the brightest and most able women in the country. Consciousness-raising groups allowed women to explore both their identities and their dreams--and the two were often found in direct conflict. What is the stereotyped role of American women?

'Too Bright' Review After crafting two albums of hauntingly introspective, largely piano-based material, Seattle singer-songwriter Mike Hadreas — better known as Perfume Genius — is blowing up in more ways than one. First, there’s his sound: on Too Bright (out now on Matador), he employs fuzzy synthesizers, distorted guitars and ghostly wails in a sonic transformation that’s akin to jumping from 2-D vision to 3-D. His lyrics, too, feel more forceful, exploring topics like queer identity politics and relationships in ways that are more unsettling and confrontational than before — though maybe that’s just his musical evolution, aided by producer Adrian Utley of Portishead, crystallizing what has been there all along. Hadreas has said the new album is about “an underlying rage that has slowly been growing since age 10 and has just begun to bubble up,” and it shows on tracks like first single “Queen,” a song about gay panic that tries to flip the judgment and fear he observes walking down the street back on his voyeurs: “No family is safe when I sashay,” he sings. It’s the album’s flashiest moment, and its biggest departure from his back catalog, but it’s also more of a slow burn than an explosion. The rage explored here is usually a quiet, droning one, sometimes aimed as much at himself as the outside world: Hadreas, a sufferer of Crohn’s disease, has a particular knack for exploring the ways the human body can be both oppressive and empowering when you’re feeling like a freak. As with Perfume Genius’ past albums, the tracks are put together beautifully, except when they intentionally aim for ugliness, like with the eruptions of static on “My Body” or the eerie, pitched-down vocals on “I’m a Mother,” a track about pressures to have a family. Those moments are intriguing, considering Hadreas has said he pursued a more commercial sound on this record. While there’s nothing on Too Bright that feels like the kind of universally accessible material that will set charts and radio playlists on fire — this isn’t quite the big pop transformation some have made it out to be — it’s hard not to experience this album as a breakthrough nonetheless. Here, he doesn’t just hold your attention — he demands it. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"In Perfume Genius' album, \\"Too Bright,\\" Seattle singer-songwriter Mike Hadreas explores topics like queer identity politics and relationships with forceful lyrics backed up by a sonic transformation featuring fuzzy synthesizers, distorted guitars, and ghostly wails.

Write an article based on this summary: There are plenty of things that make having Motor Neurone Disease (MND) \\"crappy\\" but losing the ability to speak and laugh would be too much, says Lucy Lintott.","output":"Title: The Impact of Motor Neurone Disease on Speech and Laughter: A Personal Perspective Introduction Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is a progressive neurological condition that affects the motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to the gradual decline of muscle function. With a spectrum of symptoms and life-altering changes, the disease is known for creating challenges in almost every aspect of daily living. Lucy Lintott, a fiercely resilient individual living with MND, shares her personal experience, highlighting the emotional trauma of losing the ability to speak and laugh amidst the plethora of hardships that come with the disease. The Emotional Toll of Losing Speech Of the many symptoms associated with MND, losing the ability to effectively communicate is often one of the most devastating for patients and their loved ones. Language is a fundamental part of human interaction, a way for individuals to express their thoughts, feelings, and emotions. As the disease progresses, patients like Lucy may find it increasingly difficult to share their perspectives, thoughts, and feelings with others, which can lead to a profound sense of isolation and loneliness. Speaking is not merely about sharing ideas and thoughts, but it is also an essential tool for establishing and maintaining relationships. People connect and bond with others through conversation, and many social activities are intricately linked to verbal communication. The loss of speech can further exacerbate the isolation experienced by MND patients, preventing them from participating fully in group conversations and activities. This, in turn, can lead to strained relationships and feelings of despair for individuals like Lucy, who are fighting to maintain their independence and sense of self amidst their deteriorating health. The Invaluable Role of Laughter Laughter is a universal language that transcends cultural and linguistic barriers. It is a fundamental part of encapsulating joy, happiness, and even relief. For someone with MND, humor can serve as a coping mechanism to find some degree of solace in difficult situations. However, when the disease takes away the ability to laugh physically, it creates another barrier to emotional wellbeing. Laughter has been shown to provide numerous health benefits, including stress reduction, pain relief, and a strengthened immune system. Moreover, humor is a powerful tool for connecting with others, as it can help bridge gaps in communication and cultivate understanding. When MND patients lose the ability to laugh, they may feel as though they are deprived of not only their emotional outlet but also a means of sharing and connecting with those around them. Finding Ways to Communicate For people like Lucy, finding alternative methods of communication becomes critical. Technological advancements have paved the way for augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices that can help MND patients maintain some level of verbal interaction. These devices range from simple communication boards to sophisticated electronic systems that can synthesize speech. More recent innovations like eye tracking technology enable users to control communication apps and devices simply by using their eye movements. While these tools can be life-changing for people living with MND, it's essential to recognize that the process of adapting to these devices may require time, patience, and support from caregivers and loved ones. As such, a collaborative approach, where patients, family members, and healthcare professionals work together, can make a significant difference in easing the transition to new communication methods. Conclusion Motor Neurone Disease, as a progressive neurodegenerative condition, is undoubtedly a tremendous challenge for patients and their families. However, for Lucy Lintott, the loss of speech and laughter lies at the heart of her emotional turmoil. By understanding the vital role these abilities play in human connection, emotional wellbeing, and overall quality of life, the need to support MND patients in finding alternative communication methods becomes not just a practical necessity but a compassionate endeavor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The formes fixes ( singular forme fixe , \`\` fixed form '' ) are the three fourteenth - and fifteenth - centuries French poetic forms : the ballade , rondeau and virelai . Each was also a musical form , generally a chanson , and all consisted of a complex pattern of repetition of verses and a refrain with musical content in two main sections . All three forms can be found in thirteenth - century sources but a fifteenth - century source gives Philippe de Vitry as their first composer while the first comprehensive repertory of these forms was written by Guillaume de Machaut . The formes fixes stopped being used in music around the end of the fifteenth century , although their influence continued ( in poetry they , especially the rondeau , continued to be used ) . Sometimes forms from other countries and periods are referred to as formes fixes . These include the Italian fourteenth century madrigal and later ballata and barzelletta , the German bar form , Spanish 13th century cantiga , and the later canción , and villancico .  - A chanson (\\"song\\", from Latin \\"cantio\\", gen. \\"cantionis\\") is in general any lyric-driven French song, usually polyphonic and secular. A singer specializing in chansons is known as a \\"chanteur\\" (male) or \\"chanteuse\\" (female); a collection of chansons, especially from the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, is also known as a chansonnier.  - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - A refrain (from Vulgar Latin \\"refringere\\", \\"to repeat\\", and later from Old French \\"refraindre\\") is the line or lines that are repeated in music or in verse; the \\"chorus\\" of a song. Poetic fixed forms that feature refrains include the \\"villanelle\\", the \\"virelay\\", and the \\"sestina\\".  - The Late Middle Ages or Late Medieval Period was the period of European history generally comprising the 14th and 15th centuries (c. 13011500). The Late Middle Ages followed the High Middle Ages and preceded the onset of the early modern era (and, in much of Europe, the Renaissance).  - A sestina (Old Occitan: \\"cledisat\\" ; also known as \\"sestine\\", \\"sextine\\", \\"sextain\\") is a fixed verse form consisting of six stanzas of six lines each, normally followed by a three-line envoi. The words that end each line of the first stanza are used as line endings in each of the following stanzas, rotated in a set pattern.  - Vulgar Latin or Sermo Vulgaris (\\"common speech\\") is a generic term for the \\"nonstandard\\" (as opposed to \\"classical\\") sociolects of Latin from which the Romance languages developed. Works written in Latin during classical times used Classical Latin rather than Vulgar Latin, with very few exceptions (most notably sections of Gaius Petronius' \\"Satyricon\\"). Because of its nonstandard nature, Vulgar Latin had no official orthography. Vulgar Latin is sometimes also called colloquial Latin, or Common Romance (particularly in the late stage). In Renaissance Latin, Vulgar Latin was called \\"vulgare Latinum\\" or \\"Latinum vulgare.\\"  - Old French (', ', \\"\\"; Modern French ) was the Gallo-Romance dialect continuum spoken from the 9th century to the 14th century.  In the 14th century, these dialects came to be collectively known as the \\"langues d'oïl\\", contrasting with the \\"langue d'oc\\" or Occitan language in the south of France. The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas.  - A chansonnier (, Galician and , ) is a manuscript or printed book which contains a collection of chansons, or polyphonic and monophonic settings of songs, hence literally \\"song-books,\\" although some manuscripts are so called even though they preserve the text but not the music (for example, the Cancioneiro da Vaticana and Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional, which contain the bulk of Galician-Portuguese lyric). The most important chansonniers contain lyrics, poems and songs of the troubadours and trouvères of the Middle Ages. Prior to 1420, many song-books contained both sacred and secular music, one exception being those containing the work of Guillaume de Machaut. Around 1420, sacred and secular music was segregated into separate sources, with large choirbooks containing sacred music, and smaller chansonniers for more private use by the privileged. Chansonniers were compiled primarily in France, but also in Italy, Germany and in the Iberian peninsula.  - A villanelle (also known as \\"villanesque\\") is a nineteen-line poetic form consisting of five tercets followed by a quatrain. There are two refrains and two repeating rhymes, with the first and third line of the first tercet repeated alternately until the last stanza, which includes both repeated lines. The villanelle is an example of a fixed verse form. The word derives from Latin, then Italian, and is related to the initial subject of the form being the pastoral.  - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age.  - A virelai is a form of medieval French verse used often in poetry and music. It is one of the three \\"formes fixes\\" (the others were the ballade and the rondeau) and was one of the most common verse forms set to music in Europe from the late thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries.    What is the relationship between 'formes fixes' and 'poem'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'formes fixes' and 'poem' is that formes fixes are specific types of poetic forms that were popular in the 14th and 15th centuries in France. These forms (ballade, rondeau, and virelai) consist of complex patterns of repetition of verse lines and refrains and were often set to music. A poem is a broader term that refers to a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language to evoke meanings. Formes fixes are essentially structured types of poems that were commonly used in the mentioned time period in France."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

After being seated, it took at least 15 minutes for our server to greet us. Even after they finally took our drink order, the cocktails didn't arrive for another 20 minutes. The slow service continued as we waited an inordinate amount of time for our appetizers and main courses. When our meals finally arrived, the food left much to be desired. The steak I ordered was not only overcooked, but the seasoning was bland. It tasted like a subpar meal that could be easily replicated in any home kitchen. My partner's chicken dish wasn't much better – dry, with an unappealing texture. Given the hefty price tag of our meal, I expected a much higher level of quality in both service and food. Unfortunately, The Blue Grill fell far short of those expectations. Needless to say, I won't be returning anytime soon. Step 5: Reflect on the review's overall sentiment.

Besides taking care of her home and family, Gloria also works as a cleaning lady to make ends meet and takes amphetamines to keep going. Her marriage to Antonio, a male chauvinist taxi driver, is on the rocks. Fifteen years earlier, in Germany, Antonio worked as a driver for Ingrid Muller, a German singer with whom he had a brief affair. His only mementos of their liaison are a signed photograph and a tape of her song Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen which he constantly plays and which Gloria detests. Antonio's services for Ingrid involved copying letters that she had allegedly received from Hitler himself. In his taxi Antonio meets the writer Lucas and Antonio casually mentions this fact to Lucas, who suggests that they forge Hitler's diaries for big profit. There is also a book of Ingrid's memoirs written by a friend which contains letters from Hitler which Antonio helped forge. Antonio is trying to teach the art of forgery to one of his sons, as this talent will be his only inheritance. The younger son, Miguel, who is twelve, sleeps around with older men.

It has hardly been a smooth ride, from the theft of cars to hackers stealing an early script - filming for the new Bond film Spectre has been hit by a string of disasters. And yesterday it emerged the curse of Bond had struck again, after two crew members were injured in a car crash on set in Austria. According to a source, filming was put on hold when one of the crew members was hit at high speed by a racing car during a stunt. 'Curse': Yesterday it emerged two crew members were injured in a car crash on set in Austria. Daniel Craig is pictured here in Solden, Austria filming a scene for Spectre. Daniel Craig (front left) and Rory Kinnear (front right) pictured on the first day of filming for upcoming James Bond movie Spectre. The driver lost control of the vehicle, sending it careering into the crew member and trapping them beneath the car. Last night a spokesman for the EON productions, which is behind the James Bond films, confirmed  the accident had taken place. And a relative of one of those injured in the crash said: ‘They were filming in Innsbruk [Austria] and the driver of the stunt car, a racing car, lost control. 'The car crashed into someone, wedging them between the pavement and the car. And they had to be helicoptered to a hospital. ‘Another person was injured and was taken to a different hospital. The crash also damaged lots of the filming equipment, so none of the footage can be used.’ The crash is the latest disaster to hit Spectre since filming began at the end of last year. Setbacks have included the theft of nine cars, hackers stealing an early version of the script and Daniel Craig, who is portraying Bond for the fourth time, spraining his knee while filming a fight scene at Pinewood Studios in London. In recent days plans to shoot a funeral scene in a Rome cemetery were scuppered after a Christian confraternity banned the team from filming. Behind the scenes: Filming for the new Bond movie is expected to continue tomorrow following the car crash. And they have also been blocked from shooting a chase scene at the Quattro Fontane site, where there are four 16th-century baroque fountains. Last night filming had been put on hold to deal with the car crash. The cast and crew are thought to have been relocated to Rome, where filming it due to commence tomorrow. According to a source, Bond bosses have got around the issue with the cemetery, which was to be the first Rome location, by agreeing to create a set nearby. Among the material being shot in Rome is a car crash scene, which will see some of the city’s most famous streets shut down, with 800 security guards primed to accompany residents around the neighbourhood. Spectre is the 24th film in the Bond franchise. It is due for release in October. Last night a spokesman for the film said: ‘There was an accident on set today.

The major three providers of servers at the time were IBM, Hewlett Packard, and Compaq, many of which were based on proprietary technology, such as IBM's Power4 microprocessors or various proprietary versions of the Unix operating system. Dell's new PowerEdge servers did not require a major investment in proprietary technologies, as they ran Microsoft Windows NT on Intel chips, and could be built cheaper than its competitors. Consequently, Dell's enterprise revenues, almost nonexistent in 1994, accounted for 13 percent of the company's total intake by 1998. Three years later, Dell passed Compaq as the top provider of Intel-based servers, with 31 percent of the market. Dell's first acquisition occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies for 332 million, after Dell had failed to develop an enterprise storage system in-house; ConvergeNet's elegant but complex technology did not fit in with Dell's commodity-producer business model, forcing Dell to write down the entire value of the acquisition.

Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Makes water acidic - Kills fish - Kills the soils in trees - Leaves are also harmed. The answer is:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is likely to be: \\"Introduce pollutants or chemicals into the environment, such as sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides.\\" Justification: 1. Introduce pollutants or chemicals into the environment, such as sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides: Various human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, can release pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. These chemicals can then interact with water vapor and other substances to form acids. 2. Makes water acidic: When sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides react with water vapor and other substances in the atmosphere, they form acids like sulfuric acid and nitric acid. These acidic substances can then be absorbed by rain droplets, forming acid rain. When acid rain falls on bodies of water, it makes them acidic, which can have harmful effects on aquatic life. 3. Kills fish: High acidity in water can harm or kill fish. Fish are sensitive to changes in pH levels, and a sudden increase in acidity can cause stress, damage to their gills, and even death. 4. Kills the soils in trees: Acidic water can also harm the soil that trees rely on for nutrients. When acid rain infiltrates the soil, it can change the structure and pH of the soil, making it difficult for trees to absorb essential nutrients and minerals. 5. Leaves are also harmed: Acid rain can cause direct damage to tree leaves, as the acidic water can break down the protective layers of the leaves. This can make them more vulnerable to pests and diseases, and can also interfere with photosynthesis, limiting the tree's ability to produce energy. In conclusion, the missing first step in the process is the introduction of pollutants or chemicals, such as sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides, into the environment, which ultimately leads to the creation of acid rain and its harmful effects on aquatic life, soil, and vegetation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

White mountains are often visited by tourists because of the many beautiful caves, stalactites, stalagmites and karst phenomena. Dome mountains are interesting to tourists because they are very massive, of volcanic origin and excellent for climbing.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which mountain attracts fewer tourists because of its caves?  Hint: About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years.

Can we draw the following conclusion? Preschool children are able to operate motor vehicles on public roadways.","output":"Based on the information presented in the petition, it is not possible to draw the conclusion that preschool children can operate motor vehicles on public roadways. The petition is focused on the recognition and value of managing the family home and taking care of preschool-aged children. It also highlights the perceived discrimination in the Income Tax Act against families who choose to keep their children at home rather than enroll them in institutional childcare facilities. Nowhere in the petition does it mention the capabilities and skills of preschool children, specifically in regards to operating motor vehicles. It is important to remain focused on the main issues presented in the petition, as these are the relevant details to consider while making conclusions or decisions. To assume that preschool children are able to operate motor vehicles based on the recognition of home-based childcare would be a significant leap and not founded on the information provided in the petition. For the conclusion to be accurate, there would need to be evidence or statements explicitly indicating that preschool-aged children possess the skills and understanding necessary for driving motor vehicles on public roads. Moreover, allowing young children to operate motor vehicles would seem to contradict the objective of providing home care for preschool-aged children. The petition emphasizes the value of care and safety within family homes, and it is widely accepted that children at such a young age lack the physical, cognitive, and emotional development necessary to safely navigate a motor vehicle. In conclusion, the information contained in the petition does not provide any evidence or basis to draw the conclusion that preschool children can operate motor vehicles on public roadways. It's crucial to focus on the main issue presented, which is the acknowledgement and appreciation of home-based childcare, rather than extrapolating conclusions beyond the scope of the petition's content."},{"instruction":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

He tells her that he's received a play called \\"Deathtrap\\" from a former student from a playwriting seminar. The play is ready for production and Sidney jokingly suggests that he murder the student and steal the play, a joke that becomes more serious when he learns, after calling the student, that no one else has read the play and no one else has a copy.

How to fix cable tv  Turn off then turn on your device.  It is possible that your dvr or cable box may have malfunctioned and requires a power cycle. On the device itself hold the power button for ten seconds to shut it off.","output":"Once the device is powered off, unplug it from the electricity socket. You should let the device sit unplugged for at least ten minutes. This process is known as a 'hard reset', and it allows any residual electricity to drain from the system, effectively wiping the short-term memory of the device and forcing it to 'reboot' when turned back on. This can help to resolve any software glitches that might have been causing the issue. After waiting for ten minutes, plug the device back into the electricity socket and press the power button to turn it on. Wait for the device to boot up completely. This process could take anything from a few seconds to several minutes and can vary depending on the device model. Most DVRs and cable boxes will undergo a self-diagnostic process when they boot up. You will often see a series of codes or messages on the digital display as it checks the internal components and software for problems. Some devices also automatically download and install software updates during this process. If there is a signal issue, it may provide an error code or message that can help you or your cable provider diagnose the problem. Once the device has booted up, check if your cable TV is working again. Turn to different channels, particularly the ones which were problematic, to see if the issue is resolved. If this does not work, check all the cables and connections related to your TV and cable box setup. Unplug and replug all the cables to make sure they are securely fastened. Ensure that the coaxial cable from your wall is inserted into the corresponding input on your cable box. Next, check your remote control. Make sure the batteries are working and it is functioning properly. You can test it by trying to control other devices with it, or use a digital camera (like the one in your smartphone) to see if it is emitting infrared light when the buttons are pressed.  Also, check if your TV is set to the correct input. Sometimes, it may accidentally get switched to another input, which may be why you are not getting a proper display. If none of these methods work, you may need to contact your cable provider for further assistance. They can often diagnose and fix problems from their end, like sending a signal 'refresh' to your cable box or updating its firmware. In some cases, they may need to send a technician to your home or replace your device if it's determined to be at fault. Remember, it's important to have detailed information at hand when contacting your service provider - such as the specific nature of the problems you're facing, how long the problems have been occurring, and the steps you've already taken to try and rectify the issues.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Enough with the texting, a Florida judge told Kaitlyn Hunt after hearing testimony about thousands of text messages -- some of them explicit -- the Florida teenager reportedly sent to her underage girlfriend after being ordered not to while awaiting trial on charges of having sex with the girl. Judge Robert Pegg sent Hunt, 19, to jail Tuesday, ordering her held on bond pending trial. She'll also be limited to communicating with her lawyers, guards, fellow inmates and perhaps a few choice visitors. Hunt was 18 when she was charged with two felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery after allegedly having sexual relations with the girl, who was 14. Pegg made his ruling after an Indian River Sheriff's Office detective testified about the contents of an iPod that Hunt had given the younger girl -- including more than 20,000 text messages, \\"explicit\\" videos and nude pictures -- despite a court order that the two not communicate, electronically or otherwise. \\"It's overwhelming that Ms. Hunt has chosen to violate the conditions of her bond deliberately and willfully on several occasions,\\" Pegg said in explaining his decision. In addition to the extensive exchange of messages since March -- which began days after the no-contact order was issued -- Detective Jeremy Shepherd further testified that he'd learned the two had secretively met as recently as a few weeks ago. Under cross-examination, Shepherd noted that in some cases, the younger girl initiated contact, though he emphasized that Hunt had given her the iPod on which they illicitly communicated. And the detective added, the younger teenager \\"has not told me the full truth in a couple of my interviews.\\" After Shepherd left the stand, Hunt's lawyer, Julia Graves, did not dispute that there \\"has been some contact with the victim\\" and her client. \\"We're not going to contest all the evidence,\\" Graves said Tuesday in court. \\"But what we would ask for is that the defendant (be able to be) bonded out, to be placed on house arrest without any electronic communication of any kind. ... We think that would keep the judicial process safe.\\" The judge, though, thought differently. \\"She simply can't be trusted to abide by the court order,\\" Pegg said of Hunt. The court hearing Tuesday was graphic and, for Hunt, emotional. She held a tissue in her handcuffed hands that she repeatedly used to wipe tears from her eyes. The proceeding marked the latest turn in a story that first captured the nation's attention months ago. In a written statement Wednesday, Graves slammed the prosecutors for disclosing sordid detail. Hunt's family says the relationship was consensual, with their lawyer claiming authorities wouldn't have gone after her if it had involved a male and a female instead of two teenage girls. In Florida, a person under the age of 16 is not legally able to consent to sex. Hunt's parents went public with their story after their daughter was charged. They essentially accused the alleged victim's family of going after their daughter because she is gay, while Hunt spoke out about her fears of paying for a relationship that she didn't think was wrong. \\"I'm scared of losing my life, the rest of my life,\\" she said earlier this year, \\"not being able to go to college or be around kids, be around my sisters and my family.\\" The younger girl's family, though, said that wasn't true and insisted that they were only trying to protect their own daughter. \\"We had no other alternative but to turn to the law, use it basically as a last resort,\\" the victim's father, Jim Smith, had previously told CNN affiliate WPEC. Sheriff: Teen sex case is about age, not gay rights. This debate has been playing out publicly since Hunt was charged, during which time prosecutors offered her at least two plea deals. The most recent one -- offered in July, according to Bruce Colton, the state attorney for Florida's 19th judicial circuit -- would have led to Hunt being subject to a curfew and having to do community service, but avoiding jail time and not having to register as a sex offender. But Hunt's defense team didn't accept either plea deal. Then, on August 6, the victim's father alerted authorities to the iPod and its contents, Shepherd said. He interviewed the underage girl the next day, when she told him she'd given Hunt her locker combination and found the iPod in her locker on the last day Hunt was in their school. This type of iPod allows people to exchange text messages and other media. On some of those texts, Hunt indicated that she understood that such communications violated the court order. \\"No matter what, if they find out that we talked, I'm going to jail until the trial starts,\\" she wrote, according to Shepherd. Pictures on the iPod showed the young couple together and a nude Hunt. There was also video of a naked Hunt touching herself in a sexual manner, the detective testified. Authorities determined these images originated at Hunt's home in the weeks and months after the no-contact order had been issued, said Shepherd. Graves, in her Wednesday statement, upbraided prosecutors for using frank and graphic detail in a court filing. \\"What happened to a (statements) like 'numerous texts and inappropriate language' without details?\\" she wrote. With the school year starting, she said, \\"I can only imagine the chatter at the school.\\" In the end, Graves wrote, two teen students were \\"involved in a consensual relationship.\\" \\"Yes one that under the current law is a crime, but still consensual. It was brought to an abrupt end and the older 'adult' teen faces up to 30 years in prison.\\" She said the younger girl \\"cannot comprehend the seriousness of the matter because it was something she consented to.\\" \\"Her opinion is ignored by the State,\\" Graves said. The girl has been \\"interrogated by the Sheriff's Department, taken to a church that labels being gay a sin, has the Bible thrown at her, all of her things in her room boxed up and taken from her, is apparently hit by her parents, and clearly yelled at for lying by her father in the presence of Detective Shepherd at the school in a subsequent interview.\\" Under the circumstances, she's been confused, scared, and feels no one is listening to her, Graves said. \\"She already tried to speak to Kaitlyn's mother Kelley who shut her down. So she turns to the only person who could (possibly) understand in her eyes and a person she clearly does not want to see hurt and that is Kaitlyn. She wants to try to save her and in doing so she just causes the walls to continue to tumble down.\\" Hunt, who turned 19 last week, was booked into detention Monday night after her bail bond company declined to secure her 5,000 bond any longer and picked her up. Her family has not commented on the latest developments in the case. The original charges against Hunt carry a maximum of 15 years in prison upon conviction.

The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Trading Spaces is an hour - long American television reality program that aired from 2000 to 2008 on the cable channels TLC and Discovery Home .

After the successive battlefield defeats, the bickering between the Confederation's two main powers broke out in full force. Sawlon II of Mohnyin, who had only grudgingly agreed to Hkonmaing's takeover of the Ava throne, blamed Hkonmaing for the defeats, and now planned to put Sithu Kyawhtin I of Salin on the Ava throne. In April/May 1545, Sawlon II sent Sithu Kyawhtin with an army , which went on to occupy Sagaing, the city directly across the Irrawaddy from Ava. During the rainy season, c. September 1545, Hkonmaing died, and was succeeded by his son Narapati III. The new king promptly sent a mission to Pegu to secure friendly relations in exchange for his recognition of the new de facto border between the two kingdoms. Tabinshwehti accepted the offer. Toungoo's decisive victory gave the upstart kingdom control of all of central Burma, and cemented its emergence as the largest polity in Burma since the fall of Pagan Empire in 1287. Indeed, \\"there was once more a king in Burma\\". In the following years, Ava and Mohnyin-backed Sagaing would be locked in a war until 1551, while an emboldened Toungoo would turn its attention to conquering Arakan in 1545-47, and Siam in 1547-49.

During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly.

Write a summary based on this article: WASHINGTON, D.C. -- An email exchange between former Plain Dealer columnist and Pulitzer Prize winner Connie Schultz and a conservative blogger -- posted on her Facebook page -- is stirring up the internet. (See a summary of events below, powered by Storify.)      Schultz, a longtime reporter and columnist at the newspaper who resigned in September 2011, is married to Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown -- a fact which the so far unnamed blogger was apparently unaware.      Schultz posted to her Facebook page Tuesday night what she said was an email exchange between her and the blogger.            According to a column called \\"Washington Whispers\\" on the U.S. News and World Report's website: \\"The blogger emailed Schultz on July 9 to say, smugly: 'Dear Ms. Shultz, We are doing an expose on journalists in the elite media who socialize with elected officials they are assigned to cover. We have found numerous photos of you with Sen. Sherrod Brown. In one of them, you appear to be hugging him. Care to comment?' \\"            Schultz' response: \\"Dear Mr. [Name Deleted]: I am surprised you did not find a photo of me kissing U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown so hard he passes out from lack of oxygen. He's really cute. He's also my husband. You know that, right?\\"      There has apparently been no communication between the two over the last week, but she wrote on her Facebook site Tuesday: \\"Waiting, I'm waiting....\\"      The twittersphere has been abuzz over the exchange all day today and the story was picked up by several other news organizations covering Washington, D.C.            Schultz said this morning that she hasn't named the blogger because she wants him to \\"pick better company and do better journalism.\\"      \\"I don't want to be a bully,\\" she said in a telephone interview. \\"I can say he was working for one of the larger conservative blogs, but that his name is not in the staff directory. Maybe he's an intern, maybe an editor was playing a joke on him or maybe he was trying to get a reaction out of me.      \\"But I just want him to stop hanging around with those people and learn something out of this.\\"      Schultz married Brown in 2004. She took a leave of absence during her husband's 2006 Ohio Senate race, returned to the paper in 2007 and left in 2011, citing the conflict between her job and her husband's political position.      Conservatives had criticized Schultz and The Plain Dealer, saying that she used her column to support her husband's political career. Both Schultz and the leadership of the newspaper, however, had maintained that her words are her own, and pointed out that she began writing about workers' rights and other liberal causes long before she married Brown.      She said when she resigned in 2011 that it had \\"become painfully clear that my independence, professionally and personally, is possible only if I'm no longer writing for the newspaper that covers my husband's senate race on a daily basis.\\"                  She won the Pulitzer in      She won the Pulitzer in 2005 for a series of columns published in the newspaper and online.                         ||||| The one good thing about Ohio Gov.

Have I mentioned lately how much I'm enjoying the lectures from self-avowed liberals who insist my respect for Hillary Clinton is proof that I am not a \\"real progressive\\"?      I haven't had this much fun since I had my sinuses packed with 40 miles of gauze after polyp surgery.      It's not just men — my sisters, you disappoint me — but it's particularly entertaining when the reprimands come from young white men who were still braying for their blankies when I started getting paid to give my opinion. They popped out special, I guess.      I became a columnist in the fall of 2002. Immediately, I found myself on the receiving end of right-wing vitriol so vile it made \\"The Sopranos\\" cuddly by comparison. My first death threats came within weeks, after I wrote that the Confederate flag should be retired. After I supported stronger gun control measures, an NRA zealot posted on a gun blog what he thought was my home address and identified me as \\"unarmed.\\" I was a single mother at the time. I bought new locks and kept writing.      But by all means, do tell me what I don't understand about being a progressive.      First, though, let me tell you what you clearly don't understand about me — I almost added, \\"and women like me,\\" but that would be presuming to speak for other women, which would make me sound just like you.      I am a 58-year-old wife, mother and grandmother, who first knew I was a feminist at 17. I was a waitress at a family restaurant and a local banker thought he could stick his hand up my skirt because my hands were full of dinner. In the time it took me to deposit that steaming pile of pasta onto his lap, I realized I was never going to be that girl.      Like so many other women, I soon learned that knowing who you are is no small victory, but making it clear to the rest of the world is one of the hardest and longest nonpaying jobs a woman will ever have. I'll spare you my personal list of jobs with unequal pay and unwelcome advances. No good comes from leading with our injuries.      It helped — it still helps — that my working-class parents raised me to be ready for the fight. My father was a union utility worker, my mother a nurse's aide. Both of them died in their 60s, living just long enough to see all of their children graduate from college and start their lives. I've said many times that my parents did the kind of work that wore their bodies out so that we would never have to.      That, too, is my legacy.      But, please, tell me again how I don't know what it means to be a progressive.      Last month, I started teaching journalism at Kent State University. One of the first things I did was to lug to my office the large metal sign that used to hang over the tool shed at my father's plant. \\"THE BEST SAFETY DEVICE IS A CAREFUL MAN,\\" it reads. Nice try, management.      I'm stickin' with the union, Woody Guthrie sang.      Every time I walk into my office, that sign is the first thing I see. Remember, it whispers.      What does any of this have to do with why I admire Hillary Clinton? Nothing. But it has everything to do with why I don't need any lecture from somebody who thinks he or she is going to tell me who I am because I do.      One of the hallmarks of a progressive is a willingness to challenge a power structure that leaves too many people looking up and seeing the bottom of a boot. I want power for the people who don't have it. And for the rest of my conscious days, I will do my small part to help get it. I love it when detractors describe Clinton as too angry and not \\"warm and fuzzy\\" enough. I want a leader, not a Pooh Bear.      I don't want to diminish anyone who supports Bernie Sanders. I'm married to Sanders' colleague, Sen. Sherrod Brown, which is how I've gotten to know him over the last 10 years. He's a good man.      If you support Sanders in this Democratic presidential primary, I don't assume that you hate women.      See how that works?      But if you tell me that, should Sanders lose, you won't vote for Hillary Clinton, then stop calling yourself a liberal or a progressive or anything other than someone invested in just getting your way.      There is so much at stake here. The fight for women's reproductive rights is not a sporting event. Our cities are rife with racial tensions, and too few of us white Americans fail to see this as our problem, too. The Affordable Care Act is not enough, but it is the first fragile steps toward universal health care. It is already saving lives of people who had nothing — no health care, no safety net, nothing — before it passed.      Finally, the growing gulf between the obscenely privileged and everyone else is a reason to get out of bed every morning — if we care about the future of the people we are supposed to be fighting for.      If you would sacrifice those who need us most because you didn't get your way, then please, save me your lectures and get out of my way.

Article: Chinese officials yesterday urged employers to take more measures to protect workers against workplace diseases and injuries. Experts estimate  that about 200 million workers face a potential danger of occupational diseases and work-related injuries. The majority of them are farmers-turned-workers who are working in small or medium-sized firms. One of the most serious workplace diseases on the Chinese mainland is pneumoconiosis, a lung disease that is caused by breathing in too much dust of coal, silicon, and cerement. It causes serious breathing difficulties and can be fatal . The disease killed 966 people in the country last year, according to an official report released by the Ministry of Health yesterday. From the early 1950s until the end of last year, 607,570 people were diagnosed with pneumoconiosis. Among the number, 137,481 people died from the disease. Chen Xiaohong, vice minister of health, said the general level of prevention and control of workplace diseases is still quite low in China. \\"Health authorities  at various levels will do more education work in the future to raise employers\` awareness that they are the first person responsible for any workplace diseases or accidents,\\" Chen said. He made the remark at a ceremony held by his ministry and other relevant departments under the State Council to award prizes to 56 companies which have done well in protecting workers\` health. On the Chinese mainland, more than 16 million companies are engaged in potentially dangerous sectors, such as coal mining, construction, and those that use chemicals, according to the Ministry of Health. Although many companies, especially large foreign-invested and State-owned ones, have done well in protecting workers\` health, many employees are still working in dangerous places with poor protection and without any insurance support. At least 90 per cent of Chinese companies are small or medium-sized organizations. Many of these companies, especially private ones based in towns and villages, do not want to spend their... Question: In order to protect the workers\` health,   _  . Options: A: the government should strenghthen its related laws. B: the companies should take more measures. C: the workers should fight for their rights. D: All of the above. The answer to this question is:","output":"D: All of the above. This answer makes sense considering the content of the article.  A: The government should strengthen its related laws: The article states that many workers are still working in dangerous places with poor protection and without any insurance support. This indicates a need for the government to enact and enforce stronger laws to protect workers' health and safety. B: The companies should take more measures: Chinese officials are urging employers to take more measures to protect workers against workplace diseases and injuries, so they are asking companies themselves to take more initiative. C: The workers should fight for their rights: While the article does not explicitly call for workers to take action themselves, it is implicitly suggested as a potential strategy to improve workplace conditions. Given that workers are the people most directly affected by unhealthy and unsafe conditions, they are logically one of the parties who could take action to improve those conditions. Therefore, all of the options mentioned have a role to play in the protection of workers' health according to the content of the article."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Movie plot title: Expired Movie plot: Claire, a mild-mannered parking attendant, lives in a small flat with her mother who is recovering from a recent stroke. In the opening sequence she patrols the Los Angeles streets and stumbles into an old flame, who introduces Claire to his wife and ill-behaved daughter. Reeling from the chance encounter, she steps out onto the street and is hit by a passing vehicle. Returning to work three weeks later, Claire attracts the attention of another parking attendant, an extremely blunt and aggressive man named Jay whose home life consists mainly of entertaining himself using the services of a webcam porn site and phone service. Claire witnesses him fighting with her best friend, a neighbor working for a delivery service who parks on the curb to unload her consignment, but does not bring it up with either party. She develops a crush on Jay, but in each conversation Jay takes issue with some entirely innocuous comment Claire has made and storms off in disgust. Nonetheless, he keeps coming back for more. One night as Claire prepares to join him at the annual office Christmas party, she finds her mother slumped overâdeadâin a bowl of mashed potato. In shock, she simply picks up her coat and leaves for the party. She sits alone, watching Jay dance with another woman, until finally Jay asks in brutal terms what is the matter. She takes him home to show him the problem. Claire decides that rather than call an ambulance she prefers to have the situation dealt with by family. She calls her mother's vain and self-obsessed sister, who lives in a different part of the city. Her aunt says it is too far to come at that hour of the night, but if she wants to, Claire can come pick up a necklace belonging to her mother.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Warm water floats up from the ocean - A pocket of low pressure air is created near the surface of the ocean - Warm air from outside areas pushes into the low pressure area - The warm air keeps rising and forms clouds - The wind is getting fed moisture that evaporates from the ocean - This moisture causes the swirling air and clouds to grow bigger - As it gets bigger the wind rotates faster.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less powerful hurricanes happens, how will it affect MORE POWERFUL hurricanes.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if less powerful hurricanes occur, it could potentially affect more powerful hurricanes. One possible effect of the presence of less powerful hurricanes is that they might compete for the same resources (such as warm water and low pressure areas) as more powerful hurricanes, which could affect the formation and intensification of the latter. If less powerful hurricanes are more frequent and consume some of the available warm water and low pressure areas, the conditions necessary for the formation and growing of more powerful hurricanes may become less favorable. This could lead to a decrease in the occurrence or intensity of more powerful hurricanes. However, this effect could be both direct and indirect. The direct effect would be the competition for resources, while the indirect effect could be the influence of less powerful hurricanes on other atmospheric phenomena, such as wind shear, which affects the development of hurricanes. If less powerful hurricanes change wind patterns and thus increase wind shear, this could also make it more difficult for more powerful hurricanes to form and intensify. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that less powerful hurricanes could have an effect on more powerful hurricanes through both direct and indirect mechanisms, potentially altering the formation and intensification process, and ultimately the frequency and intensity of more powerful hurricanes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3]  Now, I have a new situation: Ryan explored two lakes; Big lake, and Arrow lake to the south. Arrow lake had a river flowing into it, while Big lake presented evidence of underwater geothermal activity. Many divers drowned in Arrow lake because of temperature shock.  Answer this question please: Which lake had more occurrences of divers drowning? The answer to this question is:","output":"Arrow Lake had more occurrences of divers drowning. This is because Arrow Lake had a river flowing into it, causing cold, fresh water to enter the warmer sea. As a result, the fresh water floats over the denser saline water, creating a thermocline where the temperature rapidly increases as the diver descends. This sudden temperature change, or temperature shock, can be disorienting and dangerous for divers as it may affect their abilities to navigate and make correct decisions underwater. In contrast, Big Lake presented evidence of underwater geothermal activity. While the temperature of the deeper water in Big Lake may be warmer than the surface water, it is more likely to lead to convection currents. Although these currents can create some challenges for divers, they do not generally result in the same temperature shock experienced at Arrow Lake. Thus, divers in Big Lake face fewer risks associated with sudden and extreme temperature changes than those in Arrow Lake. Consequently, Arrow Lake had more occurrences of divers drowning due to the increased risk of temperature shock."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Some beach creatures are wonderful ----- like dolphins, but others are dangerous. Find out more about the dangerous ones -----the blue ringed octopus, puffer fish, the Blue Bottle, and stingrays. The blue ringed octopus The blue ringed octopus is not a very big creature but it is very dangerous. These octopuses are found all around Australian coast. They often lie in rock pools close to shore. The blue ringed octopus is usually a dull color1 but it shows its bright blue rings when it is in danger. If it is taken out of the water, it is able to bite a person and poison them. If this creature bites someone, they will feel numbness   around the mouth, face and neck. Puffer Fish Puffer Fish are found in all Australian seas. They are very easy to catch but must not be eaten because their flesh and internal organs contain a poison. Anyone who does eat the flesh can become sick very quickly. They may even stop breathing. The Blue Bottle The Blue Bottle is found in most Australian waters. Blue Bottles float lightly on the surface of the water but their tentacles   can be as long as 10 metres. Blue Bottles are much less dangerous than some other jellyfish but they can give a swimmer a bad sting   if the swimmer accidentally touches them. Stingrays      There are many different kinds of stingrays in Australian waters. They usually swim and feed on the bottom of the sea. Accidents can happen if people stand on them or try to pick them up. Stingrays have a sting on their tail. These stings have poison on them. If someone is stung the wound can easily become infected. Which is TRUE according to the passage? A) All creatures along the coast ofprefix = st1 /Australiaare dangerous. B) Poisonous creatures change the body color1 when in danger. C) No accident will happen unless people touch these creatures. D) If people stand on the beach, accidents can happen because of the creatures.","output":"To complete the task, I will carefully read the passage about the dangerous beach creatures and determine which statement is true according to the information provided. A) All creatures along the coast of Australia are dangerous. - The passage doesn't state that all creatures along the coast of Australia are dangerous, just some specific ones. B) Poisonous creatures change the body color when in danger. - The passage only mentions that the blue ringed octopus changes its color when in danger. It doesn't state that all poisonous creatures do this. C) No accident will happen unless people touch these creatures. - The passage describes that accidents can happen from touching or coming into contact with these creatures, such as with stingrays or the Blue Bottle. It doesn't say that accidents won't happen unless people touch these creatures, as accidents can still occur in other ways. D) If people stand on the beach, accidents can happen because of the creatures. - The passage doesn't state that accidents can happen just by standing on the beach. It says accidents can happen if people stand on stingrays, touch the Blue Bottle, or consume the puffer fish. After analyzing each statement, the one that seems to be true according to the passage is: C) No accident will happen unless people touch these creatures. Note that this statement is still a little ambiguous, but it is the closest to being true within the range of information provided in the passage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It truly set the tone for the rest of the meal. Our main course was equally delightful. The Chilean sea bass was expertly prepared with a tantalizing golden crust on the outside, revealing a tender, flaky flesh within. It was accompanied by a refreshing watercress salad, which provided a pleasant contrast of textures and a burst of vibrant flavors to cut through the richness of the fish. As self-proclaimed dessert aficionados, we were eager to round off our meal with the irresistible chocolate lava cake, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. As we broke into the cake, the molten, gooey center flowed out like velvet, tempting us to devour every last mouthful.

Q: I heard that Alex gave Jordan a funny look as Jordan entered the lecture, flustered and twenty minutes late. Jordan quickly took a seat.  And I was wondering How would Jordan feel as a result? A:","output":"In this scenario, Jordan would most likely experience a range of emotions and feelings as a result of being late to the lecture and receiving a funny look from Alex. Let's take a closer look at some of these potential emotions and consider the reasons behind them. 1. Anxiety: Arriving late to a lecture can be a nerve-wracking experience. Jordan may feel anxious due to the fear of missing essential information, the disruption their entrance may cause, and the possibility of drawing negative attention to themselves. These feelings might be exacerbated by the funny look that Alex gives, as it further emphasizes that Jordan's tardiness has been noticed and is seen as out of the ordinary. 2. Embarrassment: Feeling embarrassed is a natural response to being late, especially when the entrance is noticeable and witnessed by others. From the description, it seems Jordan's delayed arrival may have been quite conspicuous, causing them to feel a heightened sense of embarrassment. Moreover, the funny look from Alex may signify, from Jordan's perspective, that their lateness was perceived as unprofessional or unacceptable. 3. Frustration: Jordan might also feel frustrated with themselves for being late to the lecture. This emotion stems from a sense of self-disappointment, as they could be thinking that they should have been more organized, arrived earlier, or better managed their time to avoid being tardy. 4. Regret: There may be feelings of regret as well, as Jordan may be feeling remorseful about the moments of the lecture they missed. Depending on the importance of the lecture, this sense of regret could be quite strong, especially if the content covered in those twenty minutes is critical to their academic success or understanding of the subject matter. 5. Seeking validation: Jordan might feel the urge to quickly establish their competence to mitigate any potential negative impressions. They could be more eager to participate in the lecture by asking relevant questions or making insightful contributions to show that being late hasn't impacted their interest and dedication to the subject. 6. Determination: Following the initial emotional response, Jordan might feel a sense of determination to make up for being late. This determination could manifest as an increased focus on the lecture material, ensuring they take accurate and comprehensive notes and actively engage with the material to catch up on anything they missed. 7. Resilience: Lastly, Jordan's reaction may vary according to their temperament and level of resilience. Some individuals might bounce back from the experience quickly, dismissing the funny look from Alex and focusing on the lecture, while others could dwell on the incident for a more extended period, which could impact their ability to concentrate on the lecture. In conclusion, Jordan's emotions in this situation are likely to be a complex mix of anxiety, embarrassment, frustration, regret, determination, and resilience. These feelings will influence their behaviors during and after the lecture, such as seeking validation and being determined to make up for lost time. The extent to which they experience these emotions depends on their personality traits, the importance of the lecture, and any previous experiences with similar situations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"CIA and FBI\\" correctly answer the question \\"Who confirmed that the teleconference was not important to the coordination of a response to the attack?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"CIA and FBI\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Who confirmed that the teleconference was not important to the coordination of a response to the attack?\\". The correct answer should be \\"the NMCC officer and the FAA manager of the teleconference\\". The passage states that both individuals agreed that the hijacking teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the 9/11 attacks."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Instructions: In this task, you are given a context, a subject, a relation, and many options. Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes). Input: Context: Twentieth Century Fox Television (TCFTV, stylized as 20th Century Fox Television) is the television production subsidiary of 20th Century Fox, and a production arm of the Fox Television Group (both are owned by Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox). 20th Television is the syndication arm of 20th Century Fox Television., The Fox Broadcasting Company (often shortened to/commonly referred to as Fox) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is owned by the Fox Entertainment Group subsidiary of 21st Century Fox. The network is headquartered at the 20th Century Fox studio lot on Pico Boulevard in the Century City section of Los Angeles, with additional major offices and production facilities at the Fox Television Center in nearby West Los Angeles and the Fox Broadcasting Center in Yorkville, Manhattan, New York. It is the third largest major television network in the world based on total revenues, assets, and international coverage., A television special is a television program which temporarily interrupts programming normally scheduled for a given time slot. Sometimes, however, the term is given to a telecast of a theatrical film, such as \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", which is not part of a regular television anthology series such as \\"NBC Saturday Night at the Movies\\" (19611978)., Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (known as Twentieth Century-Fox with hyphen from 1935 until 1985, professionally as 20th Century Fox, Twentieth Century Fox or simply known as Fox) is an American film studio and film distributor currently owned by 21st Century Fox. It is one of the \\"Big Six\\" major American film studios and is located in the Century City area of Los Angeles, just west of Beverly Hills. The studio was formerly owned by News Corporation., Christmas or Christmas Day (meaning \\"Christ's Mass\\") is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed most commonly on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it is prepared for by the season of Advent or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night; in some traditions, Christmastide includes an Octave. The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies; when Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then disseminated the message furthermore. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many of the world's nations, is celebrated religiously by the vast majority of Christians, as well as culturally by a number of non-Christian people, and is an integral part of the holiday season, while some Christian groups reject the celebration. In several countries, celebrating Christmas Eve on December 24 has the main focus rather than December 25, with gift-giving and sharing a traditional meal with the family., Futurama is an American animated science fiction sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series follows the adventures of a late-20th-century New York City pizza delivery boy, Philip J. Fry, who, after being unwittingly cryogenically frozen for one thousand years, finds employment at Planet Express, an interplanetary delivery company in the retro-futuristic 31st century. The series was envisioned by Groening in the mid-1990s while working on \\"The Simpsons\\"; he later brought David X. Cohen aboard to develop storylines and characters to pitch the show to Fox., Matthew Abram \\"Matt\\" Groening (; born February 15, 1954) is an American cartoonist, writer, producer, animator, and voice actor. He is the creator of the comic strip \\"Life in Hell\\" (19772012) and the television series \\"The Simpsons\\" (1989present) and \\"Futurama\\" (19992003, 20082013). \\"The Simpsons\\" has gone on to become the longest-running U.S. primetime-television series in history, as well as the longest-running animated series and sitcom., Christmas Eve is the day before Christmas Day, the festival commemorating the birth of Jesus of Nazareth. Christmas Day is observed around the world, and Christmas Eve is widely observed as a full or partial holiday in anticipation of Christmas Day. Together, both days are considered one of the most culturally significant celebrations in Christendom and Western society., The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series is a satirical depiction of working-class life epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture, society, television, and the human condition., The Nativity Fast is a period of abstinence and penance practiced by the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic Churches, in preparation for the Nativity of Christ, (December 25). The corresponding Western season of preparation for Christmas, which also has been called the Nativity Fast and St. Martin's Lent, has taken the name of Advent. The Eastern fast runs for 40 days instead of four (Roman rite) or six weeks (Ambrosian rite) and thematically focuses on proclamation and glorification of the Incarnation of God, whereas the Western Advent focuses on the two comings (or \\"advents\\") of Jesus Christ: his birth and his Second Coming or \\"Parousia\\"., An angel, especially according to Abrahamic religions and Zoroastrianism, is a spiritual being superior to humans in power and intelligence. Angels are typically described as benevolent, dreadful, and endowed with wisdom and knowledge of earthly events, but not infallible; for they strive with each other, and God has to make peace between them. Most of them serve either as intermediaries between Heaven and Earth, or as guardian spirits. They are studied in the theological doctrine of angelology. In Christian Science, the word \\"angel\\" is used to refer to an inspiration from God. The use of the term has extended to refer to artistic depictions of the spirits, and it is also used figuratively to refer to messengers and harbingers, and to people who possess high qualities of goodness, purity, selflessness, intelligence, and/or beauty., Olive , the Other Reindeer is a 1999 CGI animated Christmas television special written by Steve Young , and directed by Oscar Moore .

Title: Dredd Movie plot: The future United States is an irradiated wasteland known as the Cursed Earth. On the east coast lies Mega-City One, a violent metropolis with 800 million residents and 17,000 crimes reported daily. There, an addictive new drug called \\"Slo-Mo\\" has been introduced, which slows the user's perception of time to 1% of normal. The only force for order are the Judges, who act as judge, jury and executioner. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is tasked by the Chief Judge (Rakie Ajola) with evaluating new recruit Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thrilby), a powerful psychic who failed the aptitude tests to be a Judge.In Peach Trees, a 200-storey slum tower block, drug lord Madeline Madrigal, also known as \\"Ma-Ma\\" (Lena Headley), executes three rogue drug dealers (Travis Snyders, Chad Phillips) by having them skinned, infused with Slo-Mo and thrown down the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate and learn of a drug den, which they raid. They arrest a thug named Kay (Wood Harris), whom Anderson's mind probe reveals to be the one who carried out the drug dealers' execution. Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building, using its blast shields under the pretence of a security test, preventing the Judges from leaving or summoning help.Ma-Ma orders Dredd and Anderson killed, and the Judges fight their way through dozens of armed thugs. Arriving at the 76th floor, the Judges are assaulted by Ma-Ma and her men with miniguns that rip through the walls, killing numerous residents. By breaching a damaged outer wall, the Judges become able to call for backup. Meanwhile, Ma-Ma sends her henchman Caleb (Warrick Grier) to confirm the Judges' deaths, but when they meet, Dredd throws Caleb off the tower in full view of Ma-Ma.Dredd suspects Ma-Ma is desperate to keep Kay quiet and beats him for information. Anderson intervenes and uses her psychic abilities to read Kay's mind and learn that Peach Trees is the centre of Slo-Mo...

We are given the equation: 4214 * n + 357 = -4209 * n + 8372 * n First, we need to bring all the terms with \\"n\\" together. Look at -4209 * n and 8372 * n. When we put them together, we can find their sum by adding their numbers: -4209 + 8372 = 4163. Now, our equation looks like this: 4214 * n + 357 = 4163 * n Next, let's bring all the terms with \\"n\\" on one side. We are going to take the term with the smaller number, which is 4214 * n, and subtract it from both sides of the equation. Our new equation will look like this: 357 = 4163 * n - 4214 * n Now, we again combine the terms with \\"n\\": 4163 - 4214 = -51 So the equation now looks like this: 357 = -51 * n Finally, we need to find the value of \\"n\\". To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by -51. 357 divided by -51 equals: n = -7 So the answer is n = -7. And that's it!

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options：  A. learning  B. happiness  C. competition  D. losing  E. fatigue A:","output":"D. Losing The worst part of playing games for most people is losing. This is particularly true for competitive individuals or those who are heavily involved in the gaming community. When you spend a substantial amount of time and effort invested in a game, losing can be a frustrating and disappointing experience. Losing, especially repeatedly, might leave an individual feeling deflated and discouraged. It can also lead to a decrease in self-esteem and self-confidence in some cases. This is especially true in multiplayer and online gaming environments, where the competition is stiff and the atmosphere can sometimes be toxic, with other players taking pleasure in the losses of others.  Moreover, not everyone handles losing well. Some may feel overwhelmingly stressed or upset, leading to behaviors like game rage. This is an unfortunate part of gaming culture that can rob the fun from the gaming experience.  In addition, losing can lead to a negative sense of compulsiveness or the unhealthy desire to 'play until you win', which can lead to excessive screen time and associated health issues such as eye strain, poor posture, or even addiction. This is often linked to the phenomena of 'gaming marathons', where players will invest unhealthy amounts of time continuously playing a game to achieve victory, which becomes even more detrimental if it starts affecting your daily routine, work, or relationships. Lastly, the omnipresent risk and fear of losing can sometimes overshadow the playful and enjoyable aspects of gaming, making players overly serious or tense. This is significant considering that games are, at their core, a form of entertainment, meant to provide enjoyment, relaxation, and respite from real-world pressures.  However, it's important to note that losing in games also has its positives. It can foster resilience, patience, and the understanding that it's okay to lose sometimes, and that what truly matters is the enjoyment derived from the process of playing and improving.  So while losing is often considered the worst part of gaming, its impact is largely based on personal attitudes, resilience, and the ability to maintain balance between life and gaming."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Le taux de réponse initial s'est révélé faible et décevant (au 1er avril, seulement 89 questionnaires avaient été remplis sur une possibilité de 380 répondants, soit un taux de réponse de 23 %). Translate to English","output":"The initial response rate has proven to be low and disappointing (by April 1st, only 89 questionnaires had been completed out of a possible 380 respondents, yielding a response rate of 23%). This situation can be concerning, especially considering that a low response rate might lead to inaccurate insights and conclusions, which in turn might affect the validity of the findings and the potential impact of the study or survey. Several factors might have contributed to the low response rate in this particular case: 1. Lack of awareness or interest: The potential respondents might not be aware of the survey, or they might not find the subject matter engaging enough to participate. It is crucial to increase awareness about the survey and explain its importance to the target audience. 2. Unclear instructions: The participants might not understand how to complete the questionnaire, which could be due to a lack of guidance or confusing instructions. Providing clear and concise instructions along with examples may help encourage respondents to complete the survey. 3. Length and complexity: The questionnaire might be too long or complicated for participants, which could be discouraging and lead to a lower response rate. Simplifying and shortening the survey by removing redundant or less relevant questions could increase participation. 4. Timing: The survey might have been launched at an inconvenient time for potential respondents, causing them to postpone or forget about completing it. It is important to consider the timing of the survey to ensure maximum participation. 5. Privacy concerns: Respondents might be hesitant to participate due to privacy concerns or fear that their responses might be used against them in some way. Ensure that the participants are well-informed about the confidentiality measures taken to protect their identity and the secure storage of their responses. To address the low response rate, several strategies might be considered, such as: 1. Sending reminders: Sending follow-up emails or other forms of communication to remind potential respondents about the survey and encourage participation. 2. Incentives: Providing incentives such as gift cards, discounts, or entry into a prize draw can be an attractive way to increase participation and improve the response rate. 3. Simplifying survey design: Ensure the questionnaire is straightforward and easy to understand, with a clear layout and concise questions that encourage participation. 4. Personalized communication: Address potential respondents individually and explain the survey's significance to them specifically, as this might increase their interest and willingness to participate. 5. Collaborate with key stakeholders: Partner with influential individuals or organizations within the target community who may help promote the survey and increase participation. Overall, addressing the low response rate requires a strategic approach that identifies the factors causing the low participation and implementing measures to encourage and motivate potential respondents to complete the questionnaire. By taking these steps, the likelihood of better insights and a more accurate representation of the target population can be achieved, providing more valuable data for analysis and decision-making."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Alvan Fisher ( August 9 , 1792 -- February 13 , 1863 ) was one of the United States 's pioneers in landscape painting and genre works .  - Landscape painting, also known as landscape art, is the depiction in art of landscapes  natural scenery such as mountains, valleys, trees, rivers, and forests, especially where the main subject is a wide view  with its elements arranged into a coherent composition. In other works, landscape backgrounds for figures can still form an important part of the work. Sky is almost always included in the view, and weather is often an element of the composition. Detailed landscapes as a distinct subject are not found in all artistic traditions, and develop when there is already a sophisticated tradition of representing other subjects.   - Weather is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the statistics of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \\"weather\\" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.    What is the relationship between 'alvan fisher' and 'landscape art'?

Many doctors are also interested in the effects  of laughter on our health. According to a 5-year study at the UCLA School of Medicine in California, with laughing there is less stress in the body. Laughter improves our health against illness by about 40%. So what happens at a Laughter Club? I went along to my nearest club in South London to find out. I was quite nervous at the beginning of the class, to be honest, I wasn't interested in laughing with a group of strangers, and I was worried about looking silly. Our laughter teacher told us to clap our hands and say \\"ho ho ho, ha ha ha\\" while looking at each other. However, our bodies can't tell the difference between real laughter and unreal laughter, so they still produce the same healthy effects. Surprisingly, it works! After ten minutes everybody in the room was laughing for real and some people just couldn't stop! At the end of the class I was surprised by how relaxed and comfortable I felt. So if you're under stress, then start laughing. You might be very pleased with the results.

Process:  - People dig up coal from the ground - People burn coal for heat or electricity - Pollution from the coal goes into the sky - Coal pollution enters clouds - Clouds rain over an area - The polluted rain becomes acid rain.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose virus replicates and spreads slower happens, how will it affect LESS acid rain.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"No, the supposed perturbation - that a virus replicates and spreads slower - does not have a direct effect on the process that culminates in acid rain production.  Let's look at each step of the process:  1) Digging up coal from the ground: This is a human activity involving mining and extraction. A slower-replicating virus has no direct impact on this. 2) Burning coal for heat or electricity: This also is a human activity. A change in virus replication speed does not directly affect the burning of coal. 3) Pollution from coal going into the sky: An outcome from the burning process. Again, not influenced directly by the speed of virus replication. 4) Coal pollution entering clouds: A natural process, conditional on pollution existing in the first place. It would also not be affected by virus replication speed. 5) Clouds raining over an area: This is a natural weather process unaffected by virus behavior. 6) Rain becoming acid rain: An outcome of the presence of pollution in the rain itself. This is not affected by the rate of virus replication. On the whole, it's difficult to imagine a scenario where a slower virus replication rate could somehow influence these steps specifically and thus result in LESS acid rain. That being said, indirect links can theoretically be considered if, for example, the rate of virus replication indirectly influences human behavior, industry activity, or societal resource allocation in a way that reduces overall coal usage or emissions. But such hypothetical scenarios would be much more complex and are not directly tied to the steps of acid rain production, as outlined in your process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the difference between SUV, MPV, hatchback, Sedan, and luxury cars? What is the difference between a crossover, SUV and MUV? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? OPTIONS: i. no. ii. yes.","output":"To answer these questions, let's first understand the concept behind each type of car: 1. SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle): SUVs are large vehicles designed for off-road driving capabilities, providing greater ground clearance, and offering ample cargo and passenger capacity. They feature a higher seating position, all-wheel drive, and sometimes a towing capacity. 2. MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle): MPVs are family vehicles designed to accommodate multiple passengers and luggage. These vehicles usually feature flexible seating arrangements, spacious interiors, and a high roofline to increase headroom. 3. Hatchback: Hatchbacks are compact vehicles with a two-box design, where the cargo area and passenger cabin are combined. The main characteristic of a hatchback is its rear door, which opens upwards to allow access to the cargo area. They usually have a smaller footprint than sedans. 4. Sedan: Sedans are vehicles with a three-box design, featuring separate compartments for the engine, passenger cabin, and cargo. They usually have 4 doors and a trunk lid, which opens separately from the rear windshield. Sedans are one of the most common car types and come in various sizes. 5. Luxury Cars: Luxury cars are typically high-end vehicles with advanced comfort features, enhanced performance, and premium design. They focus on providing a luxurious experience to the driver and passengers, which often results in a higher price tag. Now, let's look at the differences between crossover, SUV, and MUV: 1. Crossover: A crossover is a vehicle that combines the features of an SUV and a hatchback or a sedan. They are generally smaller and more fuel-efficient than traditional SUVs but still offer a higher driving position and some off-road capabilities. 2. SUV: As explained above, SUVs are designed for off-road driving, with greater ground clearance, all-wheel drive, ample cargo, and passenger capacity. 3. MUV (Multi-Utility Vehicle): MUV is another term used for MPV, which focuses on providing space and flexibility for family use. To address the multi-choice problem: i. No. While the two questions share similarities in asking about the differences among various types of vehicles, the first question asks about SUV, MPV, hatchback, sedan, and luxury cars, while the second question focuses on crossover, SUV, and MUV.

Harlow described Haupenthal 's personal style in a warning to potential readers of Haupenthal 's translation of Goethe 's Young Werther : \`\` the vocabulary used by Haupenthal is far from standard , and at times the Esperanto verges on the incomprehensible . ''  - An Esperantist is a person who speaks or uses Esperanto. If its meaning corresponded with its full etymology, an Esperantist would be someone who supports or specializes in those who hope (from Esperanto \\"esperanto\\" \\"a hoping one\\", \\"someone who hopes\\", from \\"esperi\\" \\"to hope\\"). Although definitions of \\"Esperantist\\" vary, according to the Declaration of Boulogne (\\"Deklaracio pri la esenco de Esperantismo\\", declaration about the essence of esperantism), a document agreed at the first World Congress of Esperanto, an Esperantist is someone who speaks Esperanto and uses it for any purpose. An Esperantist is also a person who participates in Esperanto culture.  - The Declaration of Boulogne (full name: \\"Deklaracio pri la esenco de Esperantismo\\", declaration about the essence of Esperantism) was a document written by L. L. Zamenhof and endorsed by the attendees of the first World Congress of Esperanto in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France in 1905. It defined \\"Esperantism\\" as a movement to promote the widespread use of Esperanto as a supplement to natural languages in international and inter-ethnic contexts, not as a substitute for them within their proper realm. It declared that the Esperanto movement as such is politically and religiously neutral. It noted that Esperanto is in the public domain and anyone can use it however they like, as the creator of the language resigned his rights to it at the beginning. It said that the only obligatory authority for Esperanto speakers is the \\"Fundamento de Esperanto\\" (a collection of the early grammar, dictionary and sample text documents), which all speakers of the language are recommended to imitate for the sake of stability in the language.   - A volapükologist is a person whose scientific interest is Volapük or who learns the language for hobby reasons.  - Volapük (in English; in Volapük) is a constructed language, created in 18791880 by Johann Martin Schleyer, a Roman Catholic priest in Baden, Germany. Schleyer felt that God had told him in a dream to create an international language. Volapük conventions took place in 1884 (Friedrichshafen), 1887 (Munich) and 1889 (Paris). The first two conventions used German, and the last conference used only Volapük. In 1889, there were an estimated 283 clubs, 25 periodicals in or about Volapük, and 316 textbooks in 25 languages; at that time the language claimed nearly a million adherents.

Available choices: [I] World. [II] Sports. [III] Business. [IV] Science/Tech.","output":"[III] Business. Qwest Communications, a major telecommunications company, made headlines when it agreed to pay 250 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into its accounting practices. This decision highlights the importance of financial transparency and accountability in the business world and has numerous implications for corporate governance, regulatory enforcement, and investor confidence. The investigation into Qwest Communications focused on its accounting practices, particularly its use of \\"pro forma\\" accounting which, at the time, had raised concerns in the financial sector. Pro forma accounting is an accepted method in certain circumstances, but when used improperly, it can systematically misrepresent a company's financial health. The SEC launched its investigation after multiple reports of aggressive revenue recognition practices, potentially leading to the inflated financial results reported by Qwest Communications during their early 2000s financial statements. The practices under investigation included improper booking of revenue, recognition of income in advance of receiving it, and other manipulations aimed at boosting Qwest's reported financial results. In settling the SEC investigation, Qwest Communications agreed to a 250 million payment, without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. This settlement is a significant financial hit for the company, but it also allows them to move forward without further legal entanglements or potential penalties. This case has several key implications for the business world: 1. Corporate Governance: The Qwest Communications case underscores the importance of strong corporate governance and robust oversight of financial reporting practices. It highlights the need for organizations to regularly review and update internal controls and financial reporting standards to ensure they are in compliance with regulations and best practices. 2. Regulatory Enforcement: The case also highlights the critical role of the SEC and other regulatory bodies in policing accounting practices and financial reporting in the public and private sectors. By holding companies accountable for manipulative and misleading practices, these agencies help protect the integrity of financial markets and maintain investor confidence. 3. Investor Confidence: Transparent and accurate financial reporting is the cornerstone of investor confidence. By exposing these types of deceptive practices and pursuing enforcement actions, the SEC helps to ensure that investors have the accurate information they need to make informed investment decisions. This case serves as a reminder that investor confidence can be significantly harmed when a company's financial health is misrepresented. In conclusion, the Qwest Communications case is an important example within the business world, showcasing the crucial role of regulatory enforcement and corporate governance in maintaining transparent and accurate financial reporting. By settling the SEC investigation with a 250 million payment, Qwest Communications has recognized the severity of its accounting missteps and hopes to restore trust with its stakeholders, helping to reaffirm the importance of financial transparency and accountability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: The same survey, organised by the Royal Society, revealed that 90% of 18-24 year-olds could not name a female scientific figure - either current or historical. Almost half were able to name at least one famous male scientist, such as Albert Einstein. The Royal Society's Lorna Casselton described the results as \\"frustrating\\". But the same poll also indicated that parents see scientists as good role models for their daughters. Respondents were offered a choice of six \\"role model types\\" for a daughter - ranging from a doctor or lawyer to an athlete or pop star. Almost half of the 1,000 adults questioned chose \\"life-saving doctor\\", while \\"Nobel prize-winning scientist\\" came second, with 20% selecting it as their first choice. According to the findings, public knowledge of the role played by women in major scientific breakthroughs is also low. Just 6% of those polled knew that a female scientist (Jocelyn Bell Burnell) played a major part in the discovery of pulsar stars. Only 18% were aware that another woman, Dorothy Hodgkin, discovered the structure of insulin. Professor Casselton, who is vice-president of the Royal Society, said: \\"People are still unaware of the contribution made by women to science in the past, [but] overall I am encouraged by the findings of this poll. \\"They suggest public perceptions of women in science are changing. [We] want to encourage more girls (and their parents) to see science as an achievable and desirable career path. \\"Most importantly we want to encourage them to see science not only as a fulfilling career but one that can change the world and contribute to our quality of life.\\" Summary:","output":"A survey by the Royal Society found that many young people don't know any famous female scientists. But, parents still think scientists are good role models for their daughters. People picked doctors and scientists as the best jobs for their girls, but they don't know much about women's big discoveries in science. The Royal Society wants to help people learn about women in science and show that it's a great career choice that can make the world better."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1973, she became the second woman to win the world backgammon championships. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Crawford remembered her days in Buffalo fondly.","output":"Yes, the next sentence follows given the preceding text, as it refers to Carol Ann Crawford’s connection to Buffalo, New York, which was mentioned in the provided background information. Here's a detailed and long answer: Carol Ann Crawford, born on February 22, 1934, in Buffalo, New York, had a remarkable career in both backgammon and bridge, which are two classic strategy board games that have been widely played and enjoyed by millions around the world. Bridge is a card game played with a standard deck of 52 cards, and backgammon is a board game that involves moving pieces (also known as checkers) around a board according to the roll of dice. Growing up in Buffalo, Crawford was likely exposed to a rich gaming culture, in which people engaged in various contests of skill and strategy. Additionally, her experience in Detroit, Michigan, where she spent many years, must have added to her development and growth as a player. In 1973, Crawford made history as the second woman to ever win the world backgammon championships, a prestigious achievement that demonstrated her exceptional talent in a traditionally male-dominated field. This accomplishment surely made her a noteworthy figure in the world of strategy games. As the sentence suggests, Crawford remembered her days in Buffalo fondly. This could imply that she attributed a significant portion of her success in the gaming world to her experiences and connections in Buffalo. Furthermore, her positive memories of Buffalo could be due to her upbringing in the city, which might have provided her with a solid foundation upon which she pursued her passion for games like backgammon and bridge. In conclusion, the sentence about Crawford remembering her days in Buffalo fondly indeed follows the given information in the text, as it ties into her birthplace and upbringing. The connection between her hometown and her success in the gaming world supports this narrative, and the available information paints a picture of a talented woman who cherished her roots and achieved great heights in her field."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dr. Arnold's evaluation will determine Karla's eligibility for parole. During the session, Dr. Arnold shows Karla a photo album of herself and her husband Paul Bernardo (Misha Collins) in happier times, and Karla has a memory of how they first met. However, when Dr. Arnold introduces the subject of Karla's sister Tammy, Karla becomes uncooperative. Over the following weeks, Dr. Arnold probes Karla about her knowledge of Paul's secret life as a serial rapist, and it is revealed that shortly before their marriage Paul began to rape women.

In 2012, the channel Logo redirected their content.","output":"Yes, based on the information provided, we can draw the conclusion that in 2012, the channel Logo underwent a significant redirection in terms of their content focus.  Initially, Logo TV aimed to cater primarily to the LGBT community by offering content that was either targeted specifically at this demographic or had significant relevance to their experiences, interests, and concerns. This meant that their programming included, but was not limited to, films and documentaries with LGBT themes, reality shows featuring predominantly LGBT casts, original scripted series portraying the lives and stories of LGBT characters, and specials on LGBT issues. However, the shift in 2012 toward general cultural and lifestyle programming marked a significant change from Logo TV's previously narrow focus on LGBT-centric content. This redirection can be seen as a strategic decision to appeal to a broader audience base and expand the channel's reach while still maintaining and occasionally including their previous core content. Consequently, Logo TV's programming lineup began to encompass a wider range of genres and themes. Post the redirection, some of the new content featured on Logo TV included reality shows, sketch comedies, game shows, talk shows, and late-night shows, etc. Although these programs catered to general audiences, Logo TV also attempted to retain its original LGBT audience by incorporating content that is inclusive and diverse where relevant. In this manner, Logo TV has tried to strike a balance between broadening their programming lineup while acknowledging the community and concerns that provided its initial foundation. In conclusion, it is accurate to say that in 2012, Logo TV underwent a significant redirection in terms of its content focus, expanding from its initial target of primarily LGBT viewers to include general cultural and lifestyle programming. This strategic shift has allowed the channel to broaden its audience reach while still retaining elements of its original purpose."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Gabrielle Giffords' skull with a plastic implant on Wednesday, another encouraging step in the Arizona congresswoman's recovery from a gunshot to the head more than four months ago. The surgery -- coming just days after Giffords traveled to Florida to watch her astronaut husband launch into space -- was confirmed to The Associated Press by a person familiar with the congresswoman's care. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the information has not officially been released. Doctors removed a piece of Giffords' skull to allow room for brain swelling shortly after a would-be assassin shot her in the head on Jan. 8, critically wounding her, killing six people and injuring 12 others at a political event in her hometown of Tucson, Arizona. The three-term Democratic congresswoman has been wearing a helmet adorned with an Arizona state flag. Doctors said when she arrived in Houston in late January they hoped to do the cranial surgery in May. Dr. Richard Riggs, chair of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, said the surgery to place the plastic implant is relatively simple. Recovery is short -- a day or two at the most -- and is mostly from the effects of anesthesia, he said. \\"This gives her quality of life because she won't have to worry about the helmet and protection when moving around,\\" said Riggs, who is not involved in Giffords' care. The implant is placed under the scalp, allowing hair to grow on top so it is not visible. Riggs said the piece of skull that doctors removed likely was contaminated or shattered by the bullet that pierced the left side of Giffords' brain. That would make the skull unfit to be reattached, which is why doctors would use an implant, Riggs said. Giffords' chief of staff, Pia Carusone, declined to comment on whether Giffords would undergo the surgery on Wednesday. Giffords returned to Houston and rehab late Monday from Florida, where she watched her astronaut husband, Mark Kelly, rocket into space. When space shuttle Endeavour's five Americans and one Italian got off the ground on Monday, Giffords watched in private from a wheelchair on the roof of the launch control center and remarked, \\"good stuff, good stuff,\\" according to her staff. That Giffords would watch the shuttle launch seemed improbable a little more than four months ago. And some patients don't have this type of surgery until after they are released from the hospital.

What are some of the best ways to gain weight in a healthy way? How can I gain weight naturally? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"To address the first question, \\"What are some of the best ways to gain weight in a healthy way?\\", here are some steps and justifications: 1. Calculate your caloric needs: Understand how many calories you need to maintain your current weight, and then add extra calories to create a surplus for weight gain. This is important to ensure that you consume more than you burn, allowing you to gain weight. 2. Focus on nutrient-dense foods: Incorporate whole, unprocessed foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats in your diet. This ensures that you're getting essential vitamins and minerals while gaining weight. 3. Increase protein intake: Protein is crucial for muscle growth and repair. Consuming more protein helps in gaining muscle mass instead of just fat, promoting a healthier weight gain. 4. Eat more frequent, smaller meals: Consuming multiple smaller meals throughout the day can make it easier to take in extra calories and prevent you from feeling too full. 5. Strength training: Engage in regular strength training to stimulate muscle growth and increase overall body mass. This also helps to distribute weight gain more evenly throughout the body and reduces fat accumulation. For the second question, \\"How can I gain weight naturally?\\", the steps I've mentioned above largely apply to gaining weight naturally. Consuming whole, unprocessed foods, focusing on protein, and engaging in strength training are all natural methods of gaining weight. As for whether these questions are the same, I would say they are similar in nature, but not exactly the same. The first question is focusing on healthy ways to gain weight, whereas the second question seeks natural methods to gain weight. While healthy and natural can overlap, they emphasize slightly different aspects of the process. Healthy refers to a balanced approach that promotes overall well-being, whereas natural refers to using minimally processed or artificial means. In this case, the steps suggested for each question do overlap and are applicable to both healthy and natural weight gain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They are easy to plant and easy to _ . They have a good taste. When people think about carrots, they usually think they are a kind of long, thin, orange-colored vegetable. In fact, carrots are in many different sizes and shapes. And not all carrots are orange. Carrots should be grown in a field that does not have water for a long time. The earth also should not be too hard. To prepare your carrot garden, dig up the earth and turn it over . Weather, soil condition , and time affect  the taste of carrots.

If the winter is not cold enough to freeze the ground, you can grow carrots the same way as you do during the summer months. Carrots are prepared and eaten in many different ways.

Norway's government has strict regulations on fishing to protect its fish stock. Part of Bob's job is to provide the government with fish mortality data. Today, he has two samples of fish to investigate, sample A and sample B. Bob concluded sample A had natural mortality, but sample B had fishing mortality.  But I can use this background: Fish mortality is a parameter used in fisheries population dynamics to account for the loss of fish in a fish stock through death. The mortality can be divided into two types:  Natural mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to causes not associated with fishing. Such causes can include disease, competition, cannibalism, old age, predation, pollution or any other natural factor that causes the death of fish. In fisheries models natural mortality is denoted by (M).[1] Fishing mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to fishing activities using any fishing gear.[1] It is denoted by (F) in fisheries models.  What is an answer for this question: Would pollution be a casue of death or not a cause of death for sample B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Pollution would not be a cause of death for sample B.

They follow a strict interpretation of the Bible and believe it is the ultimate authority on all matters. 3. They reject the concept of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) and believe that Jesus Christ is not God but rather the first creation of God, the Archangel Michael, who came to earth in human form. 4. They believe that Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross (which they call a \\"torture stake\\") provides redemption and the opportunity for eternal life to those who follow Jehovah's teachings. 5.

Write a \\"2.\\" movie review ( 1. negative; 2. positive;).","output":"Title: \\"The Spectacular Rise and Fall\\" NEGATIVE REVIEW: When I first heard about \\"The Spectacular Rise and Fall\\", I was intrigued by the concept. The story revolves around the life of an ambitious entrepreneur who achieved great success only to lose everything in a matter of months. The plot itself had the potential to become an inspirational tale of both success and failure, making a powerful statement about how precarious life can be. It wasn't long before I realized, however, that this film missed the mark by a wide margin. To begin with, the main character, played by an otherwise talented actor, came across as two-dimensional and unrelatable. It was difficult to develop any empathy for him because the screenplay didn't present a coherent narrative of his life before all the wealth and fame. Instead, it felt like a series of disjointed episodes thrown together haphazardly. In an attempt to rush through the protagonist's rise to stardom, the film sacrificed his character development, resulting in a shallow movie experience. Furthermore, the pace of the film was a letdown. What should have been an engaging rollercoaster ride through the lead character's journey was, in fact, a tedious and monotonous affair. Inconsistent pacing robbed the movie of any real emotional impact, leaving viewers feeling detached and ultimately dissatisfied. The editor's choice to incorporate excessive jump-cuts and flashbacks only served to further confuse the audience. Instead of enhancing the storyline and providing insight into the protagonist's past, this approach felt like a failed attempt to create a sense of depth that simply wasn't there. Lastly, while the movie had a promising premise, the execution of the plot was severely undermined. Several opportunities to explore thought-provoking themes were wasted as the film chose instead to indulge in clichés and superficial observations. In conclusion, \\"The Spectacular Rise and Fall\\" had the potential to be a compelling drama. Sadly, it's hard to recommend the film due to its lack of cohesive and engaging storytelling. A disjointed narrative, weak character development, and poor pacing make it a forgettable experience.  POSITIVE REVIEW: As I walked into the theater to watch \\"The Spectacular Rise and Fall,\\" I was curious about how the movie would tackle the protagonist's journey from rags to riches and back to rags. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this film not only lived up to my expectations but exceeded them in many ways. What struck me first was the outstanding performance of the lead actor. He embodied the ambitious entrepreneur's persona wholeheartedly, bringing all the emotions and complexities associated with a meteoric rise and an equally meteoric fall. It was a powerhouse portrayal that anchored the movie and kept me engaged from beginning to end. The screenplay was both thoughtful and innovative. The way it depicted human ambition, the perils of success, and the struggle to maintain dignity in the face of adversity was both relatable and inspiring. The dialogue felt authentic and lifelike, contributing to a rich and immersive film experience. The pacing of the movie was excellent. The director perfectly captured the changing rhythms of life at various stages, from the slow and steady climb to success, the dizzying heights of fame, and the devastating descent into obscurity. This thoughtful and well-structured pacing offered a realistic portrayal of the protagonist's journey and the impact it had on his personal life. One cannot review \\"The Spectacular Rise and Fall\\" without acknowledging the superb editing. The seamless transitions between flashbacks and the present-day storyline further enriched the narrative and provided insights into the main character's motivation and backstory. The flashbacks were tastefully integrated into the film, enhancing the movie’s depth and emotional resonance. Another aspect that elevated the movie was its commitment to exploring thought-provoking themes. The film provocatively delved into the dark side of ambition, the fleeting nature of success, and the impact of pride on personal relationships. It was an intellectual and emotional journey that left a lasting impact. In summary, \\"The Spectacular Rise and Fall\\" is a powerful and beautifully-crafted film that delves deep into the human experience. Sporting a stellar performance from its lead actor, a captivating screenplay, well-paced storytelling, and an artful blend of past and present, this movie deserves a spot on any cinephile’s must-watch list."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this particular scenario, Eli preferred utilizing the resources available at the library instead of accessing information on a fee-based website. This decision likely stemmed from several factors, including cost, availability, and reliability of the resources. First and foremost, the cost associated with using the website was a significant deterrent for Eli. It could be that Eli was on a budget or did not see the value in paying for the information when free alternatives, such as the library, were available. The library typically offers free access to various resources, including books, academic journals, newspapers, and even sometimes online databases. By opting to use the library, Eli was able to save money and allocate those resources elsewhere. Furthermore, the library has a wide range of resources, ensuring that Eli would likely find the information needed to research the contract. Libraries often have a diverse collection of materials covering various subjects, time periods, and viewpoints. This variety allows individuals like Eli to browse through different resources and gather a comprehensive understanding of their chosen topic. In some cases, librarians can also provide valuable guidance and assistance in locating specific materials, further enhancing the research experience. Additionally, the credibility and reliability of the resources found in a library can often surpass those available online, particularly on fee-based websites that may have an incentive to present biased or misleading information. In libraries, the resources are usually well-vetted and are considered reliable sources of information. This factor can be crucial for Eli, ensuring that the research conducted is based on accurate and trustworthy data. Lastly, going to the library creates a conducive environment for research and learning. The quiet surroundings and availability of reference materials often help individuals focus better on their work. This can also lead to serendipitous discoveries – stumbling upon a book or article that you didn't know existed, which can contribute significantly to your research. In conclusion, the sentence ends with \\"website\\" because that was the costlier option that Eli chose to avoid. The library provided a free, diverse, and reliable set of resources that enabled him to carry out the necessary research on the contract effectively and efficiently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jan Kaplický | Art and design | The Guardian Jan Kaplický, who has died aged 71, was the Czech architect responsible for some of the most remarkable buildings that Britain has ever seen. Hovering low over the stands at Lord's cricket ground is the press box he built with his former partner, Amanda Levete. It is an otherworldly, entirely unboxy, glossy white disc that seems to have no connection with this earth, or the mundane, muddy preoccupations of everyday building. And, indeed, it has none. It was made by boatbuilders, and is a small monument to the unshakeable optimism that every real architect must feel, in the face of endless practical difficulties that face them, from cost overruns to cricket correspondents under the impression that by entering something that looked like a flying saucer, they were becoming the victims of an alien abduction. It was their first major project, and it took Kaplický and Levete to the brink of bankruptcy. They were rescued only by becoming, in 1999, the most deserving winners in the entire history of the Stirling prize. Kaplický designed the Selfridges department store in Birmingham (2003), in the shape of a sensuous free-form iceberg, finished in Yves Klein blue, and studded with silver discs that gave the completed building something of the character of a Courrèges metal dress from the 1960s. It is pierced only by a scattering of windows that gather at pavement level like swooping teardrops. There can be no sharper division between two worlds that utterly fail to meet than the gulf between the dreaming vision of Selfridges, and the gimcrack banality of the rest of the shopping centre around it. They are two worlds that physically touch, but utterly fail to acknowledge each other. Even more remarkable are all the buildings that Kaplický designed, but which the world will never see - to say nothing of the stream of ideas for solar-powered vehicles, electric cars, jewellery, bikinis and double-decker buses. He came within a handshake of getting to build the French national library in Paris with a design that took the form of a glass canyon bisected by a pedestrian bridge across the Seine. President François Mitterrand took the final decision, and made up his mind that the most conspicuous cultural landmark in Paris should be built by a French architect. Probably not even Kaplický expected that his house for a helicopter pilot, with legs like a lunar module, and a rooftop landing pad protected by a retractable umbrella, was ever going to get built. Or that his plan for a high rise twice the size of the World Trade Centre in unmistakably phallic form, and finished in pink, was going to get a commercial backer. His designs were part of a constant commentary that he kept up on the short-sightedness of a world that he sometimes saw as conspiring inexplicably to stop him from sharing his altruistic vision of a weightless, effortless, luxurious, solar-fuelled, one-piece, neoprene-lined rocket ride to the future. His experiences at first hand with the Soviet Union left him wary of political utopias. He wanted to invent a new world, but one in which there would still be room for champagne served in the coolers that he designed for the Ivy, and for gossip in glossy restaurants. He had a languid elegance that utterly contradicted the gloomy pessimism that is an essential part of the Czech national identity. He was particularly fond of the Caprice, for whose former owners he had built a house. Kaplický's life was fractured by war and totalitarianism. He was born in Prague, the only child of a sculptor and a botanical illustrator. He remembered the German occupation, and the communist takeover, wiping out a vigorous and inventive Czech version of modernism. He was starting to make his way as an independent architect when Soviet tanks bulldozed the Prague spring in 1968. He came to London as a refugee, to find himself in the midst of the glossy world of the King's Road that he had previously only glimpsed through the keyhole of the occasional smuggled copy of Vogue. He got a job at Denys Lasdun's office, but, given Lasdun's obsession with concrete, there was nowhere less suited to Kaplický's passionate love affair with weightless architecture. He moved to the more congenial setting of Richard Rogers's studio, and he was on the Piano and Rogers team that won the Pompidou competition. He worked with another Czech emigre architect, Eva Jiricná. Later, he went on to work for Norman Foster. But throughout his time there, Kaplický had another life. He started something that he called Future Systems. It had the kind of ambitious title that suggested Nasa consultancies, and lavishly funded thinktanks, but that at first existed mainly in the minds of Kaplický and his first collaborator, David Nixon. Mainly, but not entirely. Kaplický embarked on an astonishing series of architectural drawings, and montages that mapped out an architecture quite unlike anything else the world had seen. There were projects for robot-built structures in earth orbit, weekend houses like survival capsules that could be helicoptered into position, and malleable interiors. Initially, his drawings suggested a kind of turbo-charged hi-tech that left his former employers, Rogers and Foster, looking earthbound and heavy. But while Kaplický loved machines - everything from pre-war Tatra limousines from Czechoslovakia to lunar landers, and geodesic domes, he was also fascinated by the natural world, by organic form, and the human body. It was the direction that he took with his submission for the competition for Grand Buildings in Trafalgar Square in the 1980s. The winning design proposed a reconstruction of a dim Edwardian facade. Kaplický, in sharp contrast, suggested a a free-form monocoque structure, its skin penetrated by portholes. Twenty years before the construction of an egg-shaped City Hall for London, he had pointed the way to another kind of architecture. What turned Future Systems from a brilliant thinktank about the world, and allowed it to build the Lord's media centre, and Selfridges, was Kaplický's marriage to Levete. Together they started to turn Kaplický's genius into built form. It was a marriage whose break-up in 2006 placed considerable stress on the practice. Kaplický was beginning to spend more time in the Czech Republic, where he had won a 2007 competition for a new national library in Prague that has yet to be realised, and was working on a plan for Ceske Budejovice. He had remarried, in 2007, to the film producer Eliška Fuchsová, and died within hours of the birth of his second child, a daughter. He is also survived by Josef, the son of his first marriage. • Jan Kaplický, architect, born 18 April 1937; died 14 January 2009 • This article was amended on Saturday 7 February 2009.

Answer the following question: When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

Read this: An intellectual revitalization of Europe started with the birth of medieval universities in the 12th century. The contact with the Islamic world in Spain and Sicily, and during the Reconquista and the Crusades, allowed Europeans access to scientific Greek and Arabic texts, including the works of Aristotle, Ptolemy, Jābir ibn Hayyān, al-Khwarizmi, Alhazen, Avicenna, and Averroes. European scholars had access to the translation programs of Raymond of Toledo, who sponsored the 12th century Toledo School of Translators from Arabic to Latin. Later translators like Michael Scotus would learn Arabic in order to study these texts directly. The European universities aided materially in the translation and propagation of these texts and started a new infrastructure which was needed for scientific communities. In fact, European university put many works about the natural world and the study of nature at the center of its curriculum, with the result that the \\"medieval university laid far greater emphasis on science than does its modern counterpart and descendent.\\" At the Toledo School of Translators, what language was Arabic text translated into?

The pitch of a person's voice is primarily determined by the size and shape of their larynx, specifically the length and tension of their vocal cords. 2. A larger larynx generally leads to longer and thicker vocal cords, which create deeper, lower-pitched sounds when they vibrate. 3. Conversely, a smaller larynx is associated with shorter and thinner vocal cords, which produce higher-pitched sounds.

Then, saturate the burlap sack with warm water. Make sure the corn is completely and evenly soaked. Why sprout the corn for whiskey? In short, sprouting eliminates the need for added sugar in the mash, allowing you to get a more authentic whiskey. Also called \\"malting,\\" sprouting causes enzymes in the corn to convert starches to sugar. Those sugars then become the building blocks of the alcohol in the whiskey. Keep the bag in a warm, dark environment, such as a well-insulated garage or basement. Make sure the corn remains damp for about a week and a half. During the sprouting phase, keep the temperature of the corn between 62° and 86° F (17° and 30° C). Wait for the sprouts to grow 1/4 in. (0.6 cm) long, and then rinse the corn in a bucket of clean water. While doing so, remove as many of the sprouted roots as possible by hand. Discard the sprouts. Reserve the corn. Using a rolling pin with a solid end, a wooden muddler, or any other large implement, crush the kernels in the primary fermenter. Stop when all the kernels have been broken apart.  If you want to, you can also use a grist mill to crack apart the corn. You can only do this, however, when your corn is fully dried; wet corn won't go through the grist mill properly. To dry your corn for use in a grist mill: Lay the sprouted corn in a thin layer over a clean, even surface. Place a box fan near the corn and turn it on. Let the fan dry out the damp corn, stirring a couple times a day. 9 l) of boiling hot water to the corn mash. You're now ready to ferment. Summary:","output":"To make whiskey, you first need to sprout corn (also called malting) by putting it in a wet burlap sack inside a bucket. This process helps change the corn's starch to sugar, which makes alcohol later. Keep the corn warm and wet for about a week and a half until little sprouts grow. Then, rinse the corn, remove the sprouts, and crush the kernels. This prepares the corn for fermenting, which is the next step in making whiskey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context (see options)?  Context: Return to Paradise is a live album by Styx, released in 1997. It features songs from their successful reunion tour with Tommy Shaw, but without John Panozzo, who died in July 1996. It includes three new studio tracks, including \\"Dear John\\", which Shaw wrote as a tribute to Panozzo. Hypothesis: Dear John was written before 1996. Available options:  - Yes  - It's impossible to say  - No","output":"Based on the provided context, the correct hypothesis would be \\"No\\". Let's break down the information for clarity: 1. \\"Return to Paradise\\" is a live album by Styx, released in 1997. This places the album's release after 1996. 2. The album features songs from their reunion tour with Tommy Shaw, but without John Panozzo, who died in July 1996. This specifically indicates that John Panozzo was not part of the reunion tour due to his untimely demise in 1996. 3. The album includes three new studio tracks, one of which is \\"Dear John\\", a tribute to Panozzo written by Shaw. The context essentially implies that \\"Dear John\\" was included as a tribute to Panozzo after his death, which happened in 1996. Considering that a tribute is generally made after a person's death and the facts given make no mention of its composition before that year, it's logical to infer that \\"Dear John\\" was written after Panozzo's death, hence post-1996. In conclusion, the provided context does not support the hypothesis that \\"Dear John\\" was written before 1996. Rather, the information suggests that it was written sometime before the release of the album in 1997, presumably after Panozzo's death in 1996.  Therefore, based on the provided context, we can potently contradict the provided hypothesis stating 'Dear John was written before 1996.'"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

[Davor Konjikusic] Translate this to English?","output":"Despite the privatization of the NIS company, Serbians will continue to pay high prices for poor quality gasoline. [Davor Konjikusic] The debate surrounding the privatization of the NIS (Naftna Industrija Srbije) company in Serbia brings into question the potential consequences on the country's economy and citizens. As a crucial player in the Serbian energy sector, NIS was privatized in 2008 when the Russian energy giant Gazprom bought a 51% stake in the company. Privatization, in general, is a process where the government transfers ownership of state-owned enterprises, resources or services to private sector entities. The goal of privatization is often to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and performance of companies, leading to economic growth and a healthier business environment. However, the privatization of NIS has generated some criticism, as it seems not to have resulted in the desired outcomes for Serbians. In this case, despite the company being privatized, it appears that citizens are still paying high prices for gasoline, and the quality of the fuel does not seem to have improved. The reasons behind this issue may be complex and can include factors such as insufficient competition in the gasoline market, price manipulation, lack of market regulation, or potential monopolistic practices. Moreover, the privatization of NIS brought in foreign ownership, and as such, profits generated by the company may now be partly channeled overseas, leading to reduced economic benefits to the domestic economy. In addition, the expectation that privatization would result in increased investments, more employment opportunities, and overall better market conditions for consumers might not have been met. In the energy sector, high-quality gasoline is crucial for ensuring optimal performance of vehicles and reducing their environmental impact. Low-quality gasoline can lead to engine problems, damage the fuel system, hinder vehicle performance, and increase emissions. Therefore, citizens paying high prices for poor-quality gasoline not only face financial strains but also contribute to the worsening of environmental concerns. To summarize, the privatization of the Serbian NIS company hasn't seemed to deliver the anticipated benefits to the Serbian consumers who continue to pay high prices for low-quality gasoline. Several factors, ranging from inadequate competition to potential monopolistic practices, could be responsible for this situation. It is essential for the relevant regulatory bodies to reassess the gasoline market dynamics and implement necessary measures to improve the situation for the consumers and the environment alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Options: [1]. a writer; [2]. a researcher; [3]. an athlete; [4]. not enough information; Q: Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule.

Today, high heels are strictly a female fashion that is easily found in stores. High heels are the hit items featured on the runway and are widely worn by celebrities. For instance, in the popular TV drama, Sex and the City, the main character, Carrie, is a lover of high heels that in almost every episode, she purchases a pair of gorgeous 4-inch high heels. Carrie loves the heels so much that she even sets her email address as \\"shoe girl\\". This clearly shows how much modern women love high heels. Even though high heels are popular, they are not the most comfortable shoes to wear. In many ways, high heels have already changed the shape of people's lives. Doctors have warned that continuous wear can cause back pain and serious damage to the knees. Though it is yet to be proven, some psychological reports suggest that high heels can lead to mental disorder, as it is stressful to the people who wear high heels, in the sense that they have to bear the pain in every step. According to Mayann Los Russo, chief editor of Footwear News, high heels are desirable because they make people appear taller. She says, \\"I think it goes back to the idea of pain before beauty.\\" Indeed, some people feel that they always need to look appealing in front of their peers. Still, Dr. Casey Kerrigan, a professor at Harvard Medical School, warns, \\"It takes a long time to feel the effects. And once you do, it's too late.\\" Despite the damage high heels can do to the feet and legs, they remain popular. Most women accept the pain because they like how they look wearing high heels.

Frostie, the two-month-old snow goat whose battle for survival won him millions of fans around the world, died on Monday, only about a week after he was able to walk for the first time. Edgar's Mission, a not-for-profit sanctuary for rescued farm animals outside of Melbourne, announced the news on its Facebook page today. An autopsy revealed that Frostie's spinal column was riddled with abscesses, with one so large that it was pressing on his small rumen, preventing the stomach from functioning properly and leading to bloat. Scroll down for video. Frostie the snow goat licks the nose of one of his handlers at Edgar's Mission, the animal sanctuary that took him under its wing in May. Frostie died on Monday after battling a hind leg infection since birth. 'In the early hours of Monday morning, the little champ told me he was not well, as his rapidly expanding stomach screamed bloat,' according to a post on the group's website. 'As the little guy took his last gasps of breath, he looked into my tear filled eyes as I begged him to stay. I told him I loved him and would do so forever more. It was not until I knew his spirit had passed that I would scream, “Why?” at the top of my lungs and sob inconsolably into his warm, sweet smelling white fur.' Frostie snuggles up in his bed in a picture likely taken not long before he died. His autopsy revealed that his spinal column was covered with abscesses. Edgar's Mission, a sanctuary for rescued farm animals, nursed the near-disabled baby goat back to health until he took a turn for the worst in recent days. Frostie's many admirers quickly began expressing their dismay at his passing on the website. 'No...not Frostie!! Im a bit shocked..Frostie was doing so well.' wrote Bronwyn Russell. Fostie was covered in lice, severely dehydrated and was unable to use his back legs when he was first brought to Edgar's Mission in May. At birth, he contracted a hind leg infection through his umbilical cord. An Edgar's Mission employee holds Frostie the Snow Goat in her arms an undated photo. Frostie is shown here about a week ago without the wheelchair he has used since May. The sanctuary fitted Frostie with a custom wheelchair so he could run around and play with the other animals. Pictures of the goat with his rear wheels rapidly went viral around the internet. Before being inherited by Frostie, the wheelchair belonged to Leon Trotsky - a baby pig who was injured when his mother sat on him, crushing his hind legs. Just last week it seemed all the antibiotics, painkillers and  tender love and care Frostie was receiving were doing the trick. For the first time, he was let out of his wheelchair and began running freely around the farm. 'That Frostie was a sickly little kid goat was something that we knew from the very day he came into our world,' Edgar's Mission said in the Facebook post. 'Frostie’s lot was not good, but no one told him that. He wanted to live, and that was just what we promised him we would help him do.' Despite being just one of 350 animals cared for, Frostie got all the attention he appeared to have needed at the sanctuary - which also houses cows, alpacas, deer, sheep, chicken, geese, ducks, rabbits, guinea pigs, peacocks and horses, in addition to goats and pigs. 'The fact that Frostie looked a little different was no justification to me for denying him the chance at life he so richly deserved - we would do no less if he were a puppy or kitten,' Edgar's Mission said.

An inventor named Nelly is tinkering around in her home office where she has created two new types of material that could be used in products. The first one she is calling Glubber, and the second she has named Malk. To try to figure out what type of products these new materials may be used for, Nelly is performing various tests. The first test she is doing is securing one end of the material to a table and then pulling on it and letting it go. When she performs this test on some Glubber, the material quickly snaps back toward the table. Performing the same process with some Malk, the material slowly crawls along the floor as it makes its way back to the table.  Which material is less resistant to changing shape?  Hint: Something that is elastic can return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed. This property is called elasticity . As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic force . The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this URL: The answer to this question is:","output":"The material that is less resistant to changing shape is Malk. When Nelly performed the test on Glubber, it quickly snapped back to the table, demonstrating elastic properties and a higher resistance to changing shape.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Horslips are an Irish Celtic rock band that compose, arrange and perform songs frequently inspired by traditional Irish airs, jigs and reels. The group are regarded as 'founding fathers of Celtic rock' for their fusion of traditional Irish music with rock music and went on to inspire many local and international acts. They formed in 1970 and 'retired' in 1980 for an extended period. The name originated from a spoonerism on The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse which became \\"The Four Poxmen of The Horslypse\\". In March 2004, three Horslips enthusiasts, Jim Nelis, Stephen Ferris and Paul Callaghan, put on an exhibition of Horslips memorabilia in The Orchard Gallery in Derry. It was opened by the band, who played five songs acoustically. Buoyed by this first public appearance in 24 years, Horslips returned to the studio in Westmeath to produce a studio album, Roll Back, in the summer of 2004. Described as \\"Horslips Unplugged\\", the album contained acoustic reworkings of many of their best-known songs.  The same exhibition moved to Drogheda in October 2005, courtesy of longtime fan Paddy Goodwin, and was formally opened on 6 October by a tribute band, Horslypse, composed of nine teenage musicians. Horslips did a version of \\"Furniture\\". The exhibition moved to Belfast in February and March 2006 and there were plans for a New York showing in 2007. In February 2008, the exhibition opened in Ballinamore in County Leitrim, and in July it opened in Ballybofey in Donegal.  A double DVD entitled Return of the Dancehall Sweethearts came out in November 2005. Disc one is a documentary and disc two was live footage of the band from the 1970s, including promo videos and slots on The Old Grey Whistle Test.  In December 2005, the band played in front of an invited audience for the recording of the RTE television program Other Voices in Dingle in County Kerry. Part of the set included three songs done \\"full-on\\" - the first time the band had played live and electric since October 1980.

Context: My first memory of cooking was with my grandmother, Rosemary, in Sydney. She taught me how to make scrambled eggs on her electric stovetop, the kind with the coiled heating elements, in her small, linoleum-lined kitchen with cupboards that stuck a little when they closed. She was not an exceptional cook — I can remember plenty of bland and overcooked vegetables and custard made with powder to pour into pre-bought pie cases with tinned pineapple, her specialty — but she worked hard to put a balanced, home-cooked meal on the table three times a day, every day. The eldest of eight children, she dropped out of school during the Depression to help her single mother look after her siblings and work as a seamstress at David Jones. When the Second World War broke out and she was engaged to my grandfather, Aubrey, she started working on war-torn planes (“sometimes looking as if a steam roller has gone over them,” she said) as a sheet metal worker, putting them back together, when many of the men who used to do this work were off fighting the war. She said it was just like dressmaking, only using different materials. She had a twinkle in her eye and a distinct laugh that can really only be described as a cackle. She was a strong, incredibly smart woman with a fighter spirit who led her female co-workers out on the airport tarmac one day on a strike to earn equal wages to men. I am so proud that her story is taught as part of the Australian primary school curriculum. Her dream was to have a home with that electric stove. In 1943 when she was 28 she was interviewed for Australian Women’s Weekly magazine for an article on women in men’s jobs during the war, where there is a photo of her that is etched in my memory, dressed in white, wearing a white bandana tied in a knot at the top of her dark curls, a plane behind her.

Your immune system would be less effective if you didn't get enough unconscious time, more commonly known as sleep. Sleep is essential to maintain good health, and it plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the immune system. The human body requires sleep for maintaining physiological homeostasis, cognitive functioning, and emotional well-being. Sleep is particularly important when it comes to the immune system, as it helps the body in producing and effectively utilizing components such as cytokines and T-cells that are responsible for fighting infections and preventing diseases. When you do not get enough sleep, the body's immune system starts to suffer, and the production and activity of immune-regulating elements are compromised. A lack of sleep can result in an increase of cortisol, a stress-related hormone that suppresses the immune response. Moreover, the activity of macrophages and T-cells that destroy pathogens decreases, making the body more susceptible to infections. Research has indicated that people who consistently have reduced sleep or poor-quality sleep are more likely to get sick after exposure to viruses, such as the common cold virus. Additionally, sleep-deprived individuals have a slower recovery time from infections and take longer to develop immunity after receiving vaccinations. To support a healthy immune system and overall well-being, it is essential to prioritize sleep and practice good sleep hygiene. This includes creating a consistent sleep schedule, establishing a calming bedtime routine, maintaining a sleep-conducive environment, avoiding stimulating activities or substances before bed, and seeking medical help if needed for sleep disorders. In contrast, neither fake vitamin C, green gummy bears, nor computer time has significant effects on boosting the immune system or maintaining health. While vitamin C is beneficial, \\"fake\\" vitamin C would have no impact, and computer time could actually negatively affect sleep and immune functions due to the blue light emitted from devices."},{"instruction":"Question: Information:  - His Dark Materials is an epic trilogy of fantasy novels by Philip Pullman consisting of \\"Northern Lights\\" (1995, published as \\"The Golden Compass\\" in North America), \\"The Subtle Knife\\" (1997), and \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" (2000). It follows the coming of age of two children, Lyra Belacqua and Will Parry, as they wander through a series of parallel universes. The three novels have won a number of awards, most notably the 2001 Whitbread Book of the Year prize, won by \\"The Amber Spyglass\\". \\"Northern Lights\\" won the Carnegie Medal for children's fiction in the UK in 1995.

Lyra 's Oxford is set when Lyra Silvertongue is 15 , two years after the end of the trilogy . It was released to quench the thirst of fans of the trilogy while they wait for the unspecified release of The Book of Dust , and also to expand upon Pullman 's themes from the trilogy . The book consists mainly of an illustrated short story , \`\` Lyra and the Birds '' . A fold - out map of \`\` Oxford by Train , River and Zeppelin '' is bound in the book , a fictional map of the Oxford that exists in Lyra 's world . It also includes some advertisements for books and travellers ' catalogues .

The other things might be connected with the story , or they might not ; they might be connected to stories that have n't appeared yet . It 's hard to tell . ''  - Lyra Belacqua , also known as Lyra Silvertongue, is the heroine of Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy. Lyra is a young girl who inhabits a universe parallel to our own. Brought up in the cloistered world of Jordan College, Oxford, she finds herself embroiled in a cosmic war between Lord Asriel on the one side, and the first angel to come into being, called The Authority, and his Regent, called Metatron, on the other.  - Philip Pullman CBE, FRSL (born 19 October 1946) is an English writer. He is the author of several best-selling books, most notably the fantasy trilogy \\"His Dark Materials\\" and the fictionalised biography of Jesus, \\"The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ\\". In 2008, \\"The Times\\" named Pullman one of the \\"50 greatest British writers since 1945\\". In a 2004 poll for the BBC, Pullman was named the eleventh most influential person in British culture.  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - The Subtle Knife, the second book in the \\"His Dark Materials\\" series, is a young-adult fantasy novel written by Philip Pullman and published in 1997. The novel continues the adventures of Lyra Belacqua as she investigates the mysterious Dust phenomenon and searches for her father. Will Parry is introduced as a companion to Lyra, and together they explore the new realms to which they have both been introduced.  - The Book of Dust is a forthcoming novel by Philip Pullman. It will be a companion novel to the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, and will feature Lyra Belacqua as a main character. Initially, Pullman said that the story will take place two years after the events of \\"Lyra's Oxford\\" and will tie into that book, with Lyra being \\"about sixteen.\\" He has since said \\"it might be in two volumes and I think one might take place in the time before His Dark Materials and the other might take place afterwards.\\" The book will also be \\"about Dust,\\" and will address the lack of positive portrayals of religion in the \\"His Dark Materials\\" books, although it will not be a continuation of the trilogy.

Multi-select problem: How does the next paragraph end? How to choose rabbit treats  Keep treats in small amounts.  For a rabbit, this means about a tablespoon of food. Give a small rabbit this amount once a day, while a larger rabbit can have a small treat up to three times a day. Possible answers: (1). In general, smaller rabbits like this will increase the amount of treats it requires. Instead of normally giving 25 or more treats every day, offer one every two hours or so.; (2). It helps save a lot of calories and energy for your rabbit as well. Remember, rabbits are small animals and live in a very large building and can get at least half their calories from food.; (3). Giving small treats makes it easier for your rabbit to graze, and it gives you less time to put them in their mouths. Make sure any treat is small enough for your rabbit to eat and retain weight.; (4). Giving small amounts allows your rabbit to digest whatever healthy treats you give it. Because a rabbit's digestive system is so sensitive, you need to be cautious about overwhelming it with new and complex foods that are difficult to break down.;","output":"When considering the given paragraph and the possible endings, it seems the most suitable and logical continuation is option (4).

Giving small amounts allows your rabbit to digest whatever healthy treats you give it. Because a rabbit's digestive system is so sensitive, you need to be cautious about overwhelming it with new and complex foods that are difficult to break down.\\" This ending keeps with the topic of the paragraph, which discusses the portion size of treats for rabbits and the frequency with which they should be given. By mentioning that a rabbit's digestive system is sensitive and needs to be handled with care to avoid overwhelming it with challenging foods to break down, option (4) offers useful advice to the rabbit owner on not just the quantity, but also the type of treats to be given.  Option (1) introduces a confusing idea about increasing the treat amount for smaller rabbits, which contradicts the original paragraph. Option (2) brings up an unrelated point about rabbits living in large buildings and getting calories from food, which does not fit the context. Option (3), while talking about treat size, introduces the concept of a rabbit grazing, which isn’t related to the quantity of treats.

Examples of bromates include sodium bromate,, and potassium bromate,.  - An oxoacid is an acid that contains oxygen. Specifically, it is a compound that contains hydrogen, oxygen, and at least one other element, with at least one hydrogen atom bound to oxygen that can dissociate to produce the H cation and the anion of the acid.  - Bromic acid, also known as hydrogen bromate, is an oxoacid with the molecular formula HBrO. It only exists in aqueous solution. It is a colorless solution that turns yellow at room temperature as it decomposes to bromine. Bromic acid and bromates are powerful oxidizing agents and are common ingredients in Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions. Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions are a classic example of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.  - Calcium bromate , Ca ( BrO3 ) 2 , is a salt of bromic acid and lime . It may be prepared by the anodic oxidation of calcium bromide . It is used as a flour improver ( E number E924b ) in some countries .  - Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with physical systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium but can adequately be described in terms of variables (non-equilibrium state variables) that represent an extrapolation of the variables used to specify the system in thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is concerned with transport processes and with the rates of chemical reactions. It relies on what may be thought of as more or less nearness to thermodynamic equilibrium. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a work in progress, not an established edifice. This article will try to sketch some approaches to it and some concepts important for it.  - Bromine is a chemical element with symbol Br and atomic number 35. It is the third-lightest halogen, and is a fuming red-brown liquid at room temperature that evaporates readily to form a similarly coloured gas. Its properties are thus intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. Isolated independently by two chemists, Carl Jacob Löwig (in 1825) and Antoine Jérôme Balard (in 1826), its name was derived from the Ancient Greek \\"\\" \\"stench\\", referencing its sharp and disagreeable smell.  - An aqueous solution is a solution in which the solvent is water. It is usually shown in chemical equations by appending (aq) to the relevant chemical formula. For example, a solution of table salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), in water would be represented as Na(aq) + Cl(aq). The word \\"aqueous\\" means pertaining to, related to, similar to, or dissolved in water. As water is an excellent solvent and is also naturally abundant, it is a ubiquitous solvent in chemistry.

As the decade turned, a shift in the Canucks leadership occurred as Stan Smyl resigned his captaincy prior to the 1990-91 NHL season due to a reduced on-ice role with the team. In his place, the Canucks implemented a rotating captaincy of Linden, Dan Quinn (ice hockey) and Doug Lidster; of the three, Linden retained the captaincy thereafter, becoming the youngest permanent captain in team history at 21 years of age. At the end of the season, Smyl retired as the teams all-time leader in games played, goals, assists and points. Led by Linden and in large part to Quinns dealings, the Canucks rose to prominence in the early 1990s. This increased success came roughly around the time the Oilers and Flames began to sink in the standings. As a result, Vancouver won their first division title in 17 years with 42 wins, 26 losses and 12 ties during the 1991-92 NHL season (it was also the teams first winning season since the 1975-76 season). During the campaign, the Canucks honoured Smyl, who had remained on the team as an assistant coach, by making him the first player in team history to have his jersey (number 12) retired. In the 1992 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Canucks won their first series since 1982 before being eliminated by the Oilers in the second round. Quinn and Bure became the first Canucks recipients of major NHL awards in the off-season, being awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach (Quinn assumed a dual coaching and general managerial role starting that year) and the top rookie in the league, respectively. The following year, the Canucks repeated as regular season division champions, while Bure emerged as arguably the teams first superstar with his first of back-to-back 60-goal seasons, totals which remain the highest recorded in Canucks history. As the team struggled to score in the second half of the 1993-94 Vancouver Canucks season, Bure recorded 49 goals in the clubs final 51 games and contributed to 46.45% of his teams goals in the final 47 games of the season to carry the Canucks into the 1994 post-season.

Which will rust faster given they contain the same amount of iron, a sheet or a cylinder?  Andy is participating in this years science fair. He is testing how fast metal takes to rust. He rakes 3 pieces of iron one is a cube, and the other is a sheet both weighing the same. It takes the cube almost a week to fully rust but the sheet only takes 2 days. The only difference between the two is that the sheet has more surface area. He tries this again with a cylinder so the surface area is larger than the cube but smaller than the sheet and it takes about 4 days to fully rust.  Hint: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate. Look at the hammer and nails pictured in the Figure below . Both are made of iron and will rust when the iron combines with oxygen in the air.

To combine these terms, subtract 1567*m from 1629*m. 1629*m - 1567*m = (1629-1567)*m = 62*m So the equation now becomes: 62*m = 2914 Step 2: Solve for the variable 'm' by isolating it on one side of the equation. To isolate 'm', divide both sides of the equation by 62. (62*m) / 62 = 2914 / 62 Since (62*m) / 62 = m, the equation now becomes: m = 2914 / 62 Step 3: Perform the division. 2914 / 62 = 47 Now we have the value of 'm': m = 47 So, the solution to the equation 1629*m - 1567*m = 2914 for m is m = 47."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I read this background article the other day: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.  I am facing a new situation today: Ronaldo and Jeff are two college roommates that have similar body structure and similar physical activity levels. Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who is less likely to have increased blood lipid levels? Answer:","output":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article, Ronaldo is less likely to have increased blood lipid levels. This is because he is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol.

En ce qui concerne l'allégation d'infraction au principe de non-discrimination sur la base de la nationalité, le règlement (CE) n° 626/95 du Conseil a institué des mesures particulières et temporaires visant à promouvoir le recrutement de fonctionnaires originaires des nouveaux États membres qui ont adhéré à 1 JO L 66 du 24.3.1995, p. Translate to English","output":"In regards to the allegation of infringement of the principle of non-discrimination based on nationality, Council Regulation (EC) No. 626/95 established specific and temporary measures aimed at promoting the recruitment of civil servants from the new Member States that acceded to the Official Journal of the European Union L 66, dated March 24, 1995, p. The Council Regulation (EC) No. 626/95 aims to address potential issues of discrimination towards civil servants hailing from newly-joined Member States by implementing special and temporary measures. According to this regulation, the objective is to foster equality and inclusivity among civil servants, regardless of their nationality. These specific and temporary measures are designed to ensure that civil servants who come from the new Member States are given equal access to opportunities within the European Union (EU) institutions. This is important because it encourages diversity and integration among EU officials. Ensuring that every individual has an equal chance to build their career within the EU institutions is a key component of promoting fairness and equal treatment for all Member States and their citizens. In the context of EU legislation, the principle of non-discrimination is a fundamental cornerstone in maintaining the integrity and cohesion of the Union. Nationality-based discrimination can lead to unequal access to resources, opportunities, and rights, so measures such as Council Regulation (EC) No. 626/95 are crucial to mitigate such issues. The Official Journal of the European Union, where this Regulation is published, serves as a source of information on EU laws and regulations. It contains both binding measures (such as Regulations and Directives) and non-binding measures (such as Recommendations and Opinions), as well as notices and information for citizens and businesses. In conclusion, Council Regulation (EC) No. 626/95 is a critical piece of legislation that addresses the issue of potential discrimination against civil servants from new Member States by introducing special and temporary measures. It builds upon the principle of non-discrimination to foster an atmosphere of fairness and inclusivity within the European Union institutions. By ensuring that everyone has equal access to opportunities, regardless of their nationality, the Regulation serves to strengthen the overall unity and solidarity within the European Union community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What has a cash register with a limited items line? Possible A: bookstore, supermarket, toy store, candy store, shop  Why is \\"supermarket\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"Supermarket is an answer aligned with human common sense for the given question because it is one of the most common places where a cash register with a limited items line is found. Let's explore various aspects of a supermarket to understand why this is the case: 1. Variety of products: Supermarkets carry a wide range of products – from fresh produce, processed foods, and beverages to household items, personal care products, and sometimes even clothing and electronics. This results in a large customer base with diverse shopping needs. 2. Customer experience: One of the primary concerns for supermarkets is to provide a positive and efficient shopping experience to their customers. This includes minimizing the time customers spend in queues at the cash register. To achieve this, supermarkets often have multiple check-out lanes, including some designated as \\"express lanes\\" or \\"limited items lines.\\" These lanes are specifically for customers who are purchasing a limited number of items – usually below a certain threshold, such as 10 or 15 items – enabling them to check out more quickly. 3. Volume of shoppers: Supermarkets often serve a high volume of shoppers every day, especially during peak hours or on weekends. This can lead to long queues at the cash registers if not managed efficiently. Implementing limited items lines in supermarkets is a solution that caters to a group of shoppers who only need to make small purchases, ensuring that these customers do not have to wait in long queues behind those with full carts of items. 4. Frequency of shopping visits: Customers tend to visit supermarkets more frequently compared to other types of retailers, such as bookstores or toy stores. This is because they need to replenish their groceries, household items, and other everyday essentials on a regular basis. As a result, supermarkets have higher foot traffic and transaction rates, making it crucial to have cash registers with limited-items lines to manage customer flow efficiently and reduce potential frustration. 5. Competitive nature of the market: The supermarket industry is highly competitive, and businesses continuously work to stand out from their competitors. This includes offering various features aimed at improving the overall shopping experience, such as better product selection, attractive prices, a clean and organized store layout, and efficient checkout processes – one of which is the limited-items lines at cash registers. In conclusion, \\"supermarket\\" aligns with human common sense as an answer to the given question because it is a type of retailer where customers frequently make purchases, often serving a high volume of shoppers in a competitive market. Managing customer flow and providing efficient checkout experiences, including limited-items lines, are essential aspects of supermarket operations, which make them an ideal example in this context."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Article: While I was waiting outside my wife's office building for her to get out of work, I saw a beggar coming my way from across the parking lot. \\"I hope he doesn't ask me for any money,\\" I thought. He didn't. He came and sat in front of the bus stop, but he didn't look like he could have enough money to ride the bus. After a few minutes he spoke. \\"That's a pretty car,\\" he said, pointing to my car. He was ragged  , but he had an air of dignity about himself. I gave him a smile and continued cleaning my car. He sat there quietly as I worked. The expected asking for money never came. As the silence between us widened, it seemed that a voice inside me said, \\"Ask him if he needs any help.\\" I was sure that he would say \\"yes\\", but I listened to the inner voice. \\"Do you need any help?\\" I asked. He answered in three simple but meaningful words that I shall never forget. We often look for wisdom in great men and women, and we expect it from those of higher learning and achievements. I expected nothing but a dirty hand from him, but he said three words that shook me. \\"Don't we all?\\" he said.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Today, I want to share why I think you should interview real estate agents before hiring one. Why You Should Interview Real Estate Agents Truth be told, I have only purchased one house and I’m in the process of selling it. My husband and I thought long and hard about whether we would try to sell our property on our own or hire someone to represent us. In the end, we chose the latter. If you have ever shared with friends or family that you’re looking for a home or thinking of selling your own, most everyone says something along the lines of, “Oh! I know a realtor I can recommend!” Many of you may know a real estate agent personally as well. I still think it makes sense to interview any prospective agents because they are being paid by you. When you hire someone to do work on your home, you get estimates and gather information about how and when the work will be done. When you are looking for babysitters, you meet them and see how they’ll interact with your child. When you’re an employer, you interview any potential employees. Don’t Take The Easy Route with Previous Agents and Friends Just because a friend is a realtor, doesn’t mean they’ll be the best real estate agent for you. Just because a friend recommends their realtor to you, doesn’t mean you have to hire him/her. It’s business and nobody should take it personally. Interviewing real estate agents just makes sense. Oftentimes, people don’t. Why not just use the realtor that sold you the house you’re currently in? Well, you can. But do you know how that realtor handles business when they are the listing agent versus the buyer’s agent? Do you know if they’ll want to pursue the option to be a dual agent (and double their commission)? Why not interview them while interviewing others? It won’t hurt. How long should it take to hire a real estate agent? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. it should take some time to interview multiple agents before making a decision  B. not enough information  C. you should take a few months to review agent profiles online before moving forward  D. you should call the first person recommended and hire them the same day Answer:","output":"A. It should take some time to interview multiple agents before making a decision. Taking the time to interview multiple real estate agents before deciding on one to represent you when buying or selling a property is a wise decision. Just like when searching for other professional services, it's important to interview potential real estate agents to ensure they are a good fit for your specific needs and preferences. Interviewing multiple agents allows you to gather valuable information about each agent's knowledge, experience, communication style, marketing strategies, and negotiation skills. By comparing this information, you can make an informed decision about which agent is best suited to represent you and your interests, ultimately improving your chances of finding or selling your property at the best possible price and terms. Don't be afraid to ask tough questions during the interview process. Inquire about their experience, the number of transactions they have completed, their average days on the market, and their plan for marketing your property (if selling) or finding the right property (if buying). You may also want to ask for references from past clients to get an idea of their level of satisfaction with the agent's services. Choosing an agent solely based on a friend's recommendation or because they were the agent who sold you your current property can lead to disappointment if their skills or approach don't align with your expectations. By taking the time and effort to interview multiple agents, you can ensure that you find the ideal real estate professional to help you navigate the complex world of buying or selling a home. Keep in mind that the process of interviewing real estate agents shouldn't be rushed, as this is a crucial decision in a major financial transaction. Give yourself enough time to comfortably meet with several agents and make a well-informed choice."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? A Hakka, Kate Tsui was born and raised in Hong Kong. Her father works in logistics, and while her mother is now a homemaker, she was a dancer when she was younger. Tsui also has an older sister, who is married with two kids. As of 2014, Tsui has expressed that with the exception of herself, her entire immediate family now resides in Taiwan. Aside from her development in television acting, Tsui also experienced success in developing her career in the film industry. In 2007, through a series of auditions, Tsui was cast as the female lead, alongside A-list actors Tony Leung Ka-fai and Simon Yam, in Eye in the Sky, which is a film produced by Johnnie To and directed by Yau Nai-hoi. With her performance in the film,  Eye in the Sky was praised by professional Hong Kong film critic, Sek Kei, as the best Hong Kong film in the first half of 2007. The film was subsequently entered into the Berlin International Film Festival, as well as the Shanghai International Film Festival. Through her performance in the film, Tsui was widely acclaimed to be talented in acting and a rising actress worth looking out for.  With her performance in Eye in the Sky, Tsui earned the Best Newcomer - Gold Award from Hong Kong Film Directors' Guild 2007, as well as Hong Kong Film Award for Best New Performer from the 27th Hong Kong Film Awards, held in 2008. The latter is a particularly outstanding achievement, for Tsui is, so far, the only individual to have received a Hong Kong Film Award, while being fully contracted by TVB, since Anita Yuen, who coincidentally is also a Miss Hong Kong pageant winner, won the same award back in 1993.  Professional Taiwanese film critic, Mai Ruoyu, had openly criticized the Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards, a film festival and awards ceremony held in Taiwan, for excluding Tsui and her performance in Eye in the Sky from a nomination in the Best New Performer category. He had further praised that Tsui has the most potential and talent in acting among all of TVB's Miss Hong Kong-turned-actresses, since Maggie Cheung.","output":"This text is about Kate Tsui, a Hakka actress from Hong Kong.

The sessions were interrupted by the escalating disagreement between Waters and Pink Floyd over who had the rights to the Pink Floyd name.

In a late-1986 board meeting of Pink Floyd Music Ltd (Pink Floyd's clearing house for all financial transactions since 1973), Waters learnt that a bank account had been opened to deal exclusively with all monies related to \\"the new Pink Floyd project\\".

Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”. Two years later, though, and students are indeed undertaking real life surgery work experience, experiencing a live operation theatre and seeing the pressure of the job first hand.

A teenage thug who stabbed a partygoer - then urged a gang of friends to kick and stamp on him as he lay dying - has been jailed for a minimum of 15 years. Jimmy Connors, 17, was high on cocaine when he plunged a kitchen knife into Joe Walker, 23, outside a party in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. Connors led a pack of 12 who chased Mr Walker onto grassland, plunged a knife into his back and then stood back while the thugs repeatedly kicked and stamped him. Jimmy Connors (left) was high on cocaine when he knifed Joe Walker (right) outside a party in Sheffield. Apparently pleased with his work, Connors walked away 'elated, happy and proud' of what he had done. He was found guilty of murder after a trial and today jailed for a minimum of 15 years at Sheffield Crown Court. Mr Justice John Griffith Williams said: 'Although you were only just 17-years-old when you murdered Joe Walker, I am satisfied that your reputation was such that people were frightened of you. 'And it is not surprising that people were frightened of you because you went out that night armed with a knife which you were clearly prepared to use.' The court heard Joe Walker (above) had been defending his friend who was punched and racially abused before Connors and the gang turned on him. The court previously heard that Mr Walker, of Sheffield, had been at a party in the city last September along with his friend Dennis Patterson. The trouble began when Mr Patterson went outside for a cigarette, the court heard. Mr Patterson told jurors he was attacked by a man outside the house after he was subjected to abuse from the other side of the road. The unprovoked attack left him with a broken nose and he went back into the house bleeding. Jade West, also at the party, said she. heard the argument from an upstairs bedroom and testified that Mr. Patterson had racist abuse hurled at him. The gang of thugs led by Connors chased Mr Walker to grassland nearby and pinned his arms back before knifing him. Ms West told the court she told Mr Walker about the attack, who replied he 'wasn't having people hitting his friend' and rushed outside to defend him. Mr Patterson said: 'Connors was shouting abuse at Joe, effing and blinding, and Joe ended up hitting him once. It knocked him back. 'The defendant then pulled a blade out from his trousers. It was a big kitchen knife, about eight inches.' Mr Walker was then chased by Connors and his gang down a pathway into a grassy area near the house, where the stabbing happened. Ms West said she saw Mr Walker's arms being held back, and she screamed for help. After Mr Walker was knifed she said she heard the defendant tell him: ‘You’re not going to do nowt now you’re laid out’. 'I saw Joe staggering and holding his side,' she said. 'His eyes were flickering. I didn’t know what was happening at first. He didn’t look like Joe at all.' Mr Walker died from massive internal bleeding soon after the attack. 'I was shouting for help. My phone battery was dead so I couldn’t ring an ambulance. That’s when someone came down and tried to give him mouth-to-mouth and she rang an ambulance.' The blade had severed an artery, causing severe internal bleeding, and Mr Walker died a short time later from his injuries. Mr Justice Griffith Williams said he was satisfied on the evidence that Joe Walker was not the sort of person to use 'gratuitous' violence. He said: 'Joe Walker must have been very frightened indeed [when you chased after him]. 'When you caught up with you stabbed him in the back, and not content with that you stood there when the others attacked him. 'Your immediate reaction was to boast about what you had done.' The judge lifted a reporting restriction banning the media from identifying the killer, who it emerged first started appearing before the courts when he was aged just 12. Jurors heard that the year before the fatal knife attack, Connors was handed a youth rehabilitation order for carrying an offensive weapon, an extendable baton, in a public place. Other previous convictions include burglary, car theft, possession of cannabis and theft from vehicles. In a statement, Mr Walker's parents Patrick Walker and Karen Foulstone, said: 'Nothing will ever take away the pain and heartache we feel, nor will it bring back our son. 'People need to think twice about carrying and using knives. It only shows their weaknesses. 'We are still numb from Joe’s death. Our lives have been turned upside down and the loss of Joe is difficult to describe. 'At home there is silence no laughing or joking - just tears and photographs of happier times.'","output":"A teenager in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, has been sentenced to a minimum of 15 years in prison for stabbing and instigating a brutal assault on 23-year-old Joe Walker.

Write a title for this article: Illegal marijuana growing presents a threat to the environment, according to a leading police administrators' organization. The International Association of Chiefs of Police condemned the actions of marijuana cultivators, stating the operations have caused \\"severe\\" damage to the environment. The association, which advises law enforcement on policy matters, also stated that more resources are needed to protect officers and civilians from violence associated with the operations and to reduce environmental damage from the fields, which can cost up to 15,000 per acre to clean up. Last month, state police spotted and eradicated a marijuana growing operation in a rural area near the Woodbury-Watertown line. Chicken wire surrounded the base of at least one plant to protect it. Police didn't expect to make an arrest in that operation and they didn't disclose the exact location of the field. In the Woodbury operation, police spotted the plants by helicopter, then moved in to seize the crop. A few weeks after that bust, state police found nearly 100 full-grown plants in Harwinton near the Torrington line that were awaiting harvest. They arrested a man found nearby and seized the crop, which was growing near power lines. \\"We've infiltrated a number of fields, small and large alike,\\" said Lt. J. Paul Vance, a state police spokesman. The chief's association highlighted the impact that operations can have on the environment, stating that growing operations have been found in 67 national forests in 20 states. Cultivators in large-scale operations have used banned pesticides on their illegal fields, eroded soil, diverted and polluted water supplies and left behind waste that authorities are forced to clean up, the association said. The diversion of water and chemical pollution to support the fields has led to the killing of wildlife and has damaged ecosystems, the association stated. This kind of damage has not been experienced in Connecticut -- at least not yet. Dennis Schain, a spokesman for the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said enforcement officers have come across people trying to grow marijuana outdoors and have made arrests, but the operations have been on a \\"pretty small scale.\\" \\"The plants get ripped up and nature takes its course,\\" he said. Schain said officers have yet to encounter major use of pesticides on the fields they have discovered. The seizure operations in Woodbury and Harwinton went smoothly, but in other states some growers have armed themselves with guns and have booby-trapped the entrances to their fields, which are often found in out-of-the way locations. The association pointed out that some fields have been rigged with \\"strategically placed\\" jars of acid, shotgun shells rigged to planks so they'll detonate when stepped on and even devices that shock intruders with electricity. Vance said troopers are aware that traps could be used to guard fields -- and could injure innocent bystanders -- but he couldn't recall any devices being found on Connecticut fields discovered by police. Federal agents and local police eradicate hundreds of thousands of plants on an annual basis, costing taxpayers in manpower to detect and destroy the fields and in cleanup, which entails returning the sites back to their natural state. In California alone, authorities had dismantled more than 330 sites as of December. Those operations have led authorities to determine that violence, including robberies and home invasions, increases in the areas surrounding the fields. The association cited the National Office of National Drug Control Policy in stating that in 2010, authorities in California and Oregon reported at least 11 incidents of armed confrontations or officer-involved shootings during the investigation of marijuana fields. \\"For example, in 2011, 12 homicides were related to marijuana cultivation in California, with six of those occurring on public lands and six related to the growing of marijuana under the pretext of supplying medicinal users,\\" the association stated. The association also recommended raising public awareness about the negative impact the fields have on communities.","output":"\\"Environmental Havoc: The Devastating Impact of Illegal Marijuana Cultivation\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms.

For example, Bill Paxson's character had long hair and was wearing a jacket. Then, when all the males arrived at camp, it turned out there was a character who looked like Bill Paxson, but wasn't. I said where's Bill Paxson? Then, there was a guy with his girlfriend. He said she was 21. This was supposed to be a 20-year reunion of the camp director's (Alan Arkin) most memorable. Later on, this same girl was interacting and talking about her camp experiences. That made no sense. She would have been one years old. That said, the movie turned out to be pretty good. Kevin Pollak was the nice guy who was always being teased. One guy was a complete narcissist, and ended up losing his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Arkin was interesting as an old-style camp director, who admits that he has grown out of touch with modern youth. The best part was that none of the grown-up campers were successes in life. None of them had very great careers. This seemed very real life. The movie was compared to The Big Chill. In some ways it wasn't as exciting as the Big Chill, but it was a lot more realistic.

He dresses himself in cut-off T-shirts and red trucker caps, and frequently sings about hookups and parties. But writing off Moore would be misguided, knee-jerk snobbery. The truth is, the Georgia native is making some of the most interesting and wildly appealing music that mainstream country has to offer. Moore’s style fuses modern country with arena rock that evokes the heartland sounds of Bruce Springsteen and, to a degree, Eric Church. He’s got a raspy wail and the gusto to back it up, and he cannily walks the line between rowdy and romantic in his delivery. Moore’s bravura is on full display on his second album, Wild Ones, which finally got released last month following a sting of failed launch singles and the eventual success of his latest radio hit, I’m to Blame. The album proved likable right off the bat, but the more I’ve stuck with it over recent weeks, the more I’ve come to see Wild Ones as an impressively singular release from Music Row. Though it’s not a perfect album, Wild Ones sounds unlike anything else in country music at the moment, and it pulses with energy and strong rock melodies. Some might say “Well, it sounds like it belongs in rock music” but the rock radio market has all but collapsed over the past two decades, and country has become the default new market for rock sounds. There are worse things! Most of country’s top male stars have been releasing Frankenstein-style albums over the past year, which include a handful of songs that sound vaguely country alongside songs that chase every current R&B, hip-hop and disco trend in an attempt to stay relevant. That Moore and executive producer Brett James take a decisive path in their own direction is refreshing and exciting. Lyrically, Moore does cover much of the same subject matter as his peers, but where he excels is in owning his perspective. Male country stars have gotten a bad rap in recent years for their good-old-boy personas, which find them singing reductively about women and mindlessly about partying, all while espousing southern values and empty churchgoing gestures. They don’t especially like when they’re questioned on their seemingly contradictory themes, either. It’s why so many artists bristle at the term “bro-country”. But part of Moore’s brilliance is that he bothers to throw his critics a bone. He doesn’t operate under the assumption that being a raucous party animal is the natural path of life, and his resulting wordplay lands squarely in the center of recklessness and gumption. “I like whiskey and tight denim, on good-hearted women/And for that, I make no apologies,” he sings on That’s Alright With Me. “Take your pistol-pointing finger right off of the trigger/I know where to aim: I’m to blame,” he says on I’m to Blame. That Moore bothers to feel self-critical and even slightly apologetic throughout Wild Ones has the effect of making his perspective feel actually far more unapologetic than his peers, who often seem to be going through the motions of badassery without real oomph behind their words.

Options:  A. cheer  B. joy  C. talk  D. anticipation  E. excitement A:","output":"Upon meeting a friend you haven't seen in a long time, you might likely feel a combination of different emotions. This includes both B. joy and E. excitement. Let's delve deeper into why these emotions are relevant: B. Joy: Meeting a long-lost friend can bring immense joy as your friendship likely holds a special place in your life. When you finally meet them after such an extended period, feelings of happiness and satisfaction can surface. Your heart may swell with warmth, and you may feel a sense of comfort and familiarity upon reconnecting with this person. Furthermore, joy emerges from sharing experiences, memories, and possibly, the nostalgia of recalling cherished moments spent together in the past. E. Excitement: Excitement is another emotion that typically accompanies meeting an old friend after a long time. The prospect of catching up, sharing personal updates, hearing what they have been up to, and learning about their accomplishments can be invigorating. Excitement may come from the anticipation of feeling reconnected and reigniting the bond between you two. You may also be excited to share your progress in life, discussing the changes you've experienced, and exploring your growth and development since you last saw each other. Additionally, the excitement may stem from the surprises that might occur during the meetup, as life tends to bring unexpected twists and turns to each individual's journey. While both joy and excitement are emotions you might feel upon meeting an old friend, it is essential to note that emotions are complex, and everyone's emotional experiences differ. Factors like the nature of your relationship with your friend, the circumstances surrounding your reunion, and your personal emotional state can play significant roles in shaping how you feel during such an encounter.

Land south of a water treatment plant near Praia da Luz is being searched      :: Click here for the latest on this story as police search a third site      The land just outside the resort of Praia da Luz, in the Algarve, was taped off by Portuguese police early this morning ahead of the British team's arrival.      Within an hour, British police were back out on the ground and searching the new area, which lies on the road between Praia da Luz and the town of Lagos and sits behind a water treatment plant.      Police sniffer dogs from South Wales Police were out on the land this morning and then search teams formed a line and systematically searched the ground with sticks.      Local handyman Candido Furtado told Sky News: \\"I can't understand why they are searching here, On this land they will only find bones from buried horses and donkeys.      \\"I have always worked here and I never seen anything suspicious or any disturbed ground.\\"      Madeleine vanished from a holiday apartment in the resort in May 2007 while her parents Gerry and Kate dined with friends nearby.      The couple from Rothley, Leicestershire, said last week: \\"We are kept updated on the ongoing work in Portugal and are encouraged by the progress.\\"      The new searches come after the initial scrubland site in Praia da Luz was wound down on Sunday evening.      Specialist teams had scoured the ground for seven days using radar equipment, police sniffer dogs and forensic archaeologists, but it is not thought that they found anything of significance to the investigation.      One police officer told Sky News as he left the site that the new searches would be \\"more of the same\\".      Portuguese police sources have said a series of suspects will be questioned in the near future once the searches have concluded.      Scotland Yard has refused to reveal what intelligence led them to the search areas or to give any updates on their progress. ||||| Media caption The BBC's Tom Burridge reports from the scene of Wednesday's searches      Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have completed their search of three sites near the Algarve holiday resort of Praia da Luz.      Portuguese and British officers were seen shaking hands with each other, and taking down a police cordon.      Police sources have confirmed to the BBC that Wednesday's searches have now been completed.      Madeleine was three when she went missing in Praia da Luz in May 2007.      The BBC's Tom Burridge, in Praia da Luz, said he saw police appearing to be saying their goodbyes to each other.      After the physical search is over, Portuguese police are due to question \\"several suspects\\" who are described as of interest in the case.      Earlier on Wednesday, police used bolt cutters to open gates to get into the 15-acre grounds of a property, which made up the third search site.      Officers also spent three hours searching an area of grassy land about 15 minutes' walk from Praia da Luz - which was the second area they have searched in the past 10 days.      Two dogs, from South Wales Police, were seen with their handlers inside the second search site, where officers concentrated on a smaller area marked out with police tape.      'Several suspects'      Yellow and white police tape had earlier been stretched around the area and had been guarded by armed local police.      The area included a plot of land with vegetables growing in the middle and a number of dilapidated outbuildings around it.      The BBC understands the land is owned by a construction company based near the Portuguese capital Lisbon and has been left as scrubland after permission to build on it was turned down.      A source said Portuguese police had searched the land in 2007 - after Madeleine disappeared - and had visited the site \\"four or five times\\".      It comes after a week-long search of another site - a 15-acre area of scrubland in Praia da Luz - was completed at the weekend and police cordons were removed on Sunday night.      Image caption UK police searched the second site, outside Praia da Luz, using sniffer dogs      Image caption The site is around 15 minutes' walk from Praia da Luz, where Madeleine went missing in May 2007      Portuguese police have said nothing of interest was found during last week's search. However, they announced \\"several suspects\\" were likely to be interviewed in the \\"very near future\\".      UK police had already asked authorities if they could speak to three \\"people of interest\\", the BBC understands.      'Encouraged'      British officers will be allowed to sit in, but cannot intervene in proceedings, Portuguese officials have said.      The search resumed on Wednesday after a two-day pause because of a Portuguese national holiday.      A variety of techniques, including the use of ground-penetrating radar and sniffer dogs, have already been employed by the team of officers from Portugal and the UK.      Image caption The search moved from a 15-acre area of scrubland in Praia da Luz, which was the focus last week      Image caption The search is continuing after Portuguese police announced \\"several suspects\\" are to be interviewed      It is the most significant police activity in Praia da Luz since Madeleine went missing seven years ago.      Her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, had been eating dinner with friends a short distance away when the three-year-old disappeared from their Ocean Club holiday apartment.      The McCanns, from Rothley, Leicestershire, have said they have been \\"encouraged\\" by the progress made by police.      The search in Praia da Luz comes after the Met launched a fresh investigation into Madeleine's disappearance last July, codenamed Operation Grange. ||||| British and Portuguese police switch search to new area of scrubland on outskirts of Praia da Luz      Police sources have told the Guardian that the search on a second site in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz has been terminated without any relevant finds in the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.      A new site has now been cordoned off across the road from where searches took place on Wednesday morning, and detectives are to scour this area.      British detectives have until Friday to conclude ground searches. But police sources told the Guardian that searches could end as early as Wednesday evening, should there be no relevant discoveries.      No further ground searches are planned, sources said.      Police sources added: \\"Several suspects are set to be questioned in the near future, but this will definitely not take place this week or the beginning of next,\\" suggesting that they would probably occur within the next two to three weeks.      \\"The timing will depend entirely on PJ police and no clear date or location have been scheduled for interrogations,\\" they said.      Across from the site, graffiti in big red letters has been scrawled across a wall, stating: \\"Polícia inglesa estupidos\\" (stupid English police) with Madeleine's name written alongside it, but spelt as \\"Meddi\\".      Specialist teams spent last week investigating an area of land a few minutes' walk from the Ocean Club resort, where Madeleine was staying with her family in May 2007 when she disappeared, aged three. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Detectives continue the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann by cordoning off a new site south of a water treatment plant near Praia da Luz. British and Portuguese investigators have employed techniques like radar equipment, police sniffer dogs, and forensic archaeologists in their searches, but so far, nothing of significance has been found.

It was a bit battered, but thankfully intact. \\"Here you go,\\" she said, a hint of bemusement in her voice. \\"I hope whatever's in there is worth all this trouble.\\" Sara clutched the backpack to her chest as if it were the most precious thing in the world. “You have no idea,” she whispered, her voice shaky. Falcon's diary held not just his thoughts and experiences, but also vital information about their mission - information that, in the wrong hands, could spell disaster for the entire operation. Shea, still oblivious to the importance of the backpack's contents, looked around at the chaos that surrounded them. The remains of their vehicle smoldered, and the acrid smell of burning metal filled the air. \\"We need to keep moving, Sara. We can't stay here.\\" Nodding, Sara adjusted the straps of the backpack, ensuring that it was secured tightly around her shoulders. Despite her anxiety, she couldn't help but feel a renewed determination and sense of purpose. The weight of the diary on her back served as a reminder of the responsibility she carried, as well as the trust Falcon placed in her. Together, they picked their way through the debris, avoiding the gaze of curious onlookers and passersby. They needed to find a safe place to regroup, to assess the damage and plan their next move. As they moved further away from the wreckage, Shea glanced at Sara, concern etched on her face. \\"You alright? You looked like you were about to have a breakdown back there.\\" Sara forced a laugh, trying to sound nonchalant. \\"Yeah, it's just...that diary means a lot to me. It belonged to Falcon, and it's the only thing I have left of him. I couldn't bear to lose it.\\" She didn't mention the sensitive information stored in its pages - it wasn't the right time. Shea nodded, her expression softening. \\"I understand. We've all lost people we care about.\\" Suddenly, Sara stopped in her tracks, her eyes widening in realization. \\"Shea, we need to contact the others. They need to know what happened, and we can't risk being tracked. We need a secure line.\\" Shea scanned their surroundings, looking for a suitable location. \\"I know a place. It's just a few blocks away - it's an old abandoned warehouse. We can use it as a temporary base of operations.\\" With renewed urgency, the pair hastened towards the warehouse, keenly aware that time was of the essence. They couldn't afford any more setbacks or delays, not with the weight of their mission hanging in the balance. Inside the warehouse, Sara retrieved a secure satellite phone from the backpack, grateful that it had survived the crash. She punched in the number for their commander, pacing anxiously as the line connected. When the familiar voice answered, she breathed a sigh of relief before speaking. \\"Commander. It's Sara. The truck was destroyed, but we managed to retrieve Falcon's diary. We're at a safe location and need further instructions.\\" Silence stretched on the other end of the line for a moment before the commander spoke. \\"Well done, Sara. We'll send an extraction team to your location. Keep the diary safe; its contents could be the key to bringing down our enemies.\\" As they awaited their extraction, Sara couldn't help but think of Falcon. He had given his life for their cause, and now she bore the responsibility of carrying on his legacy.

One needs memory to ride a bicycle. A dog needs to remember if it is to come when called. Memory is said to be stored in the brain as a \\"memory trace .\\" What makes up this trace is not known. Some scientists believe that certain chemical substances may carry certain memories. For example, one substance, when given to rats, causes them to fear the dark. Other research into memory has to do with how the brain works. Psychologists use three means to find out how a person remembers. For example, give a person a grocery list. Let the person memorize the list, then put it away. The most natural way to find out how much a person remembers of the grocery list is to ask what he or she remembers. This is called the method of recall. Another method is called recognition. Give the person another grocery list. Ask him or her to choose items on the first list from the items that are on only the second list. Often a person will be able to recognize things that he or she cannot recall. A third method of finding how much a person remembers is called relearning. Here the person is asked to read over the first list. The person will probably learn the list the second time faster than he did the first time. The difference in the time it takes to relearn the list is thought of as a measure of how much a person has remembered. One way of remembering something is to repeat it many times. Interest is very important. Boring lists of facts are much more difficult to remember than something that we understand and are interested in. Motivation, or wanting to do something, is also important. Motivation is linked with reward. For example, a hungry animal quickly learns how to do something if that action gets the animal food. In humans, wanting to learn is often motivation. The praise of a teacher or the knowledge that an answer is correct is rewarding.

Movie title: When Nietzsche Wept Movie plot: The film opens with the Russian-born novelistâwho eventually became a member of Freud's 'Vienna Circle'-- Lou Andreas-Salome (Katheryn Winnick) who had an unconsummated (Platonic) 'love affair' with German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (Armand Assante), and to whom he allegedly proposed in 1882 (although whether her claims are true is very much up for debate) writing a letter to Dr Josef Breuer (Ben Cross), after hearing of his newly developed talking cure (Breuer was a friend of Sigmund Freud (Jamie Elman), who also appears in the story, and one of the influential fathers of psychoanalysis.). The two meet, and a reluctant and troubled Breuer agrees to Salome's plan; to cure the intense migraine attacks that plague Nietzsche, and at the same time, without his knowing, cure the despair that her refusal of marriage has inflicted upon him. Salome has persuaded Franz Overbeck (Nietzsche's friend) to send him to Breuer, however, Nietzsche offers no support to Breuer, so the course of treatment must end. In a chilling parallel, an encounter with a mistreated horse causes Nietzsche to redeem his appointment with Breuer (Nietzsche finally went mad after stopping a man from whipping a horse using his own body, before breaking down in tears and descending into insanity). Nietzsche later visits a whorehouse, where he has another attack of migraine, exacerbated by the overuse of a sleeping draught. Nietzsche decides that he will, instead of pursuing treatment, leave for Basel. Meanwhile, an up-and-coming psychologist Sigmund Freud, friend of Josef and Mathilde Breuer, suggests that if Breuer was to make some confession to Nietzsche, he may stop seeing any positive sentiment shown as being a bid for power, and indulge in confessions of his own. So, the next time they met, Breuer makes the suggestion that, while he treats Nietzsche's body, Nietzsche must \\"treat\\" Breuer of the despair that he feels after falling in love with one of his patients, Bertha Pappenheim (played by Michal Yannai), otherwise known as Anna O., a...

Protesters threw burning T-shirts and plastic bottles at police outside the rally at a convention centre in Albuquerque. Demonstrators held banners that read \\"Trump is Fascist\\" and \\"We've heard enough\\", and some waved a Mexican flag. Police responded by firing pepper spray and smoke grenades at the crowd. Protesters also interrupted Mr Trump's speech at the rally. New Mexico is the most Hispanic state in the US, and Mr Trump has angered many with his comments on illegal immigration and his plan to build a border wall with Mexico. Illegal immigration raises heat in US election Donald Trump wants to deport every single illegal immigrant - could he? Why Mexicans are troubled by Trump Trump's migrant plan attacked by rivals The protest had begun peacefully outside the Albuquerque Convention Center a few hours before the rally began. Tensions rose as Trump supporters began to arrive at the centre, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Both sides started trading abuse, including racial insults, and protesters threw water and water bottles. As the number of protesters swelled to more than 600, the demonstration turned violent. Albuquerque police said bottles and rocks were thrown at officers and police horses, and several were injured. They were seen responding by firing pepper spray and smoke grenades into the crowd. Mr Trump, speaking to a crowd of 4,000 people, was typically robust in his response to the protesters. \\"How old is this kid?\\" he asked of one that disrupted the rally, adding: \\"Still wearing diapers.\\" To others, he said: \\"Go home to mommy.\\" University student Karla Molinar told the Associated Press she took part in disrupting his speech because she felt Mr Trump was attacking members of her family who were living in the country illegally. She said she believed he is using them as scapegoats for the nation's problems. The biggest news out of Donald Trump's New Mexico rally wasn't the unrest outside the venue - we've seen such demonstrations before. It's the sharp tone the presumptive Republican nominee took toward the state's Republican governor, Susana Martinez. \\"She's got to do a better job,\\" he said, as he criticised the state's economy, the number of people on food stamps and her decision to allow Syrian refugees to resettle in New Mexico. Ms Martinez had said she was \\"too busy\\" to attend the rally in Albuquerque, the state capital - and Mr Trump obviously took note. Mr Trump is now the Republican standard-bearer, but it seems he will not always be magnanimous in victory. Although polls show most Republicans rallying around the Trump banner, holdouts will be remembered and punished. Whether that's part of a strategy or a fit of pique doesn't really matter - with Mr Trump, it seems one and the same. Following Mr Trump's statements, Ms Martinez's office issued a terse response: \\"The governor will not be bullied into supporting a candidate until she is convinced that candidate will fight for New Mexicans.\\" Ms Martinez's name has often been mentioned as a possible Trump running mate who could help buoy his strikingly negative poll approval ratings with women and Hispanics. I think we can cross her off the list. This is not the first time violence has broken out at Mr Trump's rallies. He cancelled a gathering in Chicago in March after clashes between his supporters and opponents. Albuquerque is the first stop of Mr Trump's tour of New Mexico, and his rally came on the same day he easily won the Republican presidential primary in Washington state. His opponents have dropped out of the race, and he is now just a few votes short of securing the 1,237 delegates needed to officially become the Republican candidate for November's presidential election. New Mexico's Republican Governor Susana Martinez has been critical of Mr Trump's attacks on immigrants and has not yet said if she will support his candidacy for the election. She and other senior members of the local Republican party stayed away from Tuesday's rally.","output":"Protesters clashed with police outside a Trump rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, throwing burning T-shirts and plastic bottles, while police responded with pepper spray and smoke grenades."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.

Well, we are on the verge of a move (whenever the house sells, we’ll move), and I keep thinking that I need to sit down and write a list of our “would likes” and our “must haves.” That way, when we are house hunting, we’ll already know what we’re looking for. For a chance to win an Un Amore custom-designed KitchenAid Stand Mixer from PartSelect, I have been thinking about the top three “would likes” for our new kitchen and decided to check out what KitchenAid has to offer! I discovered three appliances that would change our reality kitchen into a dream kitchen. We have two young boys that will change into tweens and teens before we know it. Big Brother has always been a good eater, open to trying just about anything we put in front of him. However, discovering that he actually does have some control over what he does, he’s lately turned up his nose on occasion. Little Brother is exactly like me when I was young. He turns his nose up at just about anything. Although he did just spend a week with his grandparents and decided he would eat and make up for lost meals…and make me out to be a liar! Anyway, I keep reminding myself as I find myself challenged at mealtimes, that soon enough, they’ll be eating us out of house and home. So, one of the larger dream kitchen appliances I’d like in our home would be a double oven! I just think it’d come in really handy when trying to keep up with their metabolism down the road!

Available options: + yes; + it is not possible to tell; + no;","output":"Yes, based on the premise \\"Since the Great Collapse, every country on Earth has had a particular national stereotype, and all the history books have been altered to make it seem forever-so,\\" we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"History has been changed since the Great Collapse to fit different stereotypes\\" is true. In this particular scenario, we are presented with the idea that a significant event, known as the Great Collapse, has occurred. The details of this event are not provided, but it is clear that it has had a major impact on how history is recorded and the national stereotypes associated with each country. The premise states that all the history books have been altered which indicates a deliberate and widespread effort to modify the historical record. Moreover, this alteration is specifically aimed at fitting different stereotypes, and it seems to target every country on Earth. This would suggest that, upon studying the history books post-Great Collapse, one would find a consistent pattern of national stereotypes being emphasized and reinforced. It is implied that the real events and nuances of history have been replaced, adjusted, or distorted to fit the desired stereotype of each nation, which ultimately affects the perception of each country's identity and culture. Given this information, we can draw the conclusion that the historic accounts have indeed been changed since the Great Collapse to fit different stereotypes. This conclusion is in agreement with the presented premise and it meets the necessary condition to validate the hypothesis as true. However, it is essential to recognize that the authenticity of the premise \\"Since the Great Collapse, every country on Earth has had a particular national stereotype, and all the history books have been altered to make it seem forever-so\\" must be accepted for this conclusion to hold true.

Article: A recent study suggests that teens' relationship with parents, friends and teachers may have a lot to do with why they don't get a good night's sleep. David Maume, a sociologist and sleep researcher, analyzed federal health data, which interviewed 974 teenagers when they were 12, and then again at 15. He found that family dynamics   have much to do with how well kids sleep. Teens, who had warm relations with their parents and felt like they could talk to them or their parents were supportive of them, tended to sleep better. However, families that were going through a divorce or a remarriage tended to affect teens' sleep. And problems at school also affected teens' sleep. Feeling safe at school and having good relations with teachers tended to promote better sleep. As did good relationships with friends. Kids who took part in sports or other positive social activities or shared similar academic goals with their friends were also more likely to get a good night's sleep. These add up to what makes lots of sense: a general feeling of well-being helps teens sleep. If we're happy and contented, we're much more likely to sleep better than if we're sad and anxious. Now, of course, teens can hardly resist being drawn to their computers and social networking. Maume also found that when parents were strict not only about bedtime, but also about limiting technology, kids slept better. It's a finding that seems obvious, but parents really do matter when it comes to health habits of their teenagers. Clearly, teenagers aren't getting 9 to 10 hours a night, which puts them at risk for all the consequences of lack of sleep, including poor academic performance, colds and stress. Question: What is the passage mainly about? Options: A: Teens' sleep is linked to their relationship with people around them. B: Lack of adequate sleep puts teens at risk of many bad consequences. C: Modern technology has something to do with teens' sleep problems. D: It is necessary for teens to join in sports and positive social activities.

A new device for granting assent was created during the reign of King Henry VIII. In 1542, Henry sought to execute his fifth wife, Catherine Howard, whom he accused of committing adultery; the execution was to be authorised not after a trial but by a bill of attainder, to which he would have to personally assent after listening to the entire text. Henry decided that \\"the repetition of so grievous a Story and the recital of so infamous a crime\\" in his presence \\"might reopen a Wound already closing in the Royal Bosom\\". Therefore, parliament inserted a clause into the Act of Attainder, providing that assent granted by Commissioners \\"is and ever was and ever shall be, as good\\" as assent granted by the sovereign personally. The procedure was used only five times during the 16th century, but more often during the 17th and 18th centuries, especially when George III's health began to deteriorate.

The third Fred MacMurray/Carole Lombard film is a bit more serious than Hands Across the Table and The Princess Comes Across. It's yet another adaption of the play Burlesque which apparently was popular back in the day. The original play Burlesque ran on Broadway in the 1927-1928 season for 372 performances and it's the role that Carole Lombard plays that Barbara Stanwyck originated on Broadway that brought her to Hollywood. A version starred Nancy Carroll in the early days of talkies and later on Betty Grable and Dan Dailey did still another version of it in When My Baby Smiles At Me. In fact I have a vinyl album of a radio version that Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler did for the Lux Radio Theater. That's an interesting work, believe me. Anyway MacMurray and Lombard do fine by the old chestnut, the story is now set in a nightclub where Lombard is a singer and MacMurray is a jazz trumpeter. Note a nice performance by Dorothy Lamour as the Latin vixen who gets between Fred and Carole. Also Anthony Quinn is in one of his earliest films as a wolf on the make for Lombard.

World-class athletes from across the globe gathered with equal anticipation and hope for a glorious victory; one that would etch their name in the annals of history. Amidst these titans of track and field stood the legendary British Olympic champion, Mo Farah, poised to make his mark on the 2014 London Marathon. Little did anyone know that his marathon debut would capture the attention of the world and write a compelling tale of triumph, despite finishing eighth overall. This remarkable performance came against the backdrop of Kenyan world record holder Wilson Kipsang's exhilarating display, securing his second title in London. The marathon joined two great athletes in an epic battle that managed to capture the spirit of both sportsmanship and athleticism. Farah, a celebrated British long-distance runner, undoubtedly felt the weight of expectations that come with being a two-time Olympic gold medalist and three-time world champion. Speaking about his marathon debut, Farah quipped, \\"I will be back.” He further confessed, \\"That was tough. I'm very disappointed. I know the crowd was out there, shouting and cheering for me. I wanted to give them a little more, but I just didn't have it at the end.\\" Despite his disappointment, his words exhibited the determination of a true champion, hungry to rise up and conquer new challenges. The race, however, belonged to the 32-year-old Kenyan Wilson Kipsang, the marathon world record holder who displayed incredible stamina to secure his second London Marathon title with a record-breaking time of 2:04:29. Kipsang left his rivals in awe, as he shattered the previous course record of 2:04:40 set by fellow compatriot Emmanuel Mutai in 2011. \\"It was fantastic to win this race in such a strong field,\\" Kipsang said during the post-race interview. \\"I wanted to break the course record, which I did. Everything was superb today, the weather was perfect, and I really enjoyed the atmosphere.\\" The success of these two runners serves as a vivid reminder that the marathon continually transcends merely being a race, rather evolving into an arena of human achievement. Throughout history, marathons have been synonymous with perseverance, resilience, and most importantly, the pursuit of excellence. The 2014 London Marathon stood testament to the triumphant spirit of the world's finest athletes. As the spectators cheered on, a colossal arch of human capability expanded, holding in its core the unyielding determination of the world's finest athletes. For as long as marathons continue to be run, stories of legendary achievements such as Mo Farah's resilient marathon debut amidst Kenyan world record holder Wilson Kipsang's victorious strides shall continue to inspire generations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While playing piano at a cocktail party in New York City, he is approached by wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who mistakenly believes that Ripley went to Princeton University with his son, Dickie, because Ripley is wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. Greenleaf recruits Ripley to travel to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to the United States, for which he will pay Ripley 1,000 (equivalent to 8,834 in 2015). Ripley accepts the proposal, even though he did not attend Princeton and has never met Dickie. Upon arriving by ship in Europe, Ripley meets a wealthy textile heiress named Meredith Logue. During their brief conversation, he impulsively pretends to be Dickie, later commenting in voice-over that \\"it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" Shortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley fakes a chance encounter on the beach with Dickie and his fiancÃ©e, Marge Sherwood. Ripley later discloses to Dickie and Marge that Mr. Greenleaf paid him to travel to Europe and persuade Dickie to return home. This revelation infuriates Dickie; he declines the invitation and suggests Ripley go back to America and inform his father that he has no intention of ever returning. Ripley instead ingratiates himself into Dickie's life under the pretext of being a fellow jazz lover. The two concoct a scheme for Ripley to wring additional funds from Greenleaf by regularly mailing letters suggesting Dickie is wavering and will likely return to America if Ripley can remain in Italy and continue applying pressure. On a jaunt to Rome, Ripley meets Dickie's friend Freddie Miles, who treats Ripley with barely concealed contempt. A local girl, pregnant by Dickie, drowns herself after he refuses to help her financially; this sends Dickie into a downward spiral.

She preferred the black nylon number.","output":"To determine if \\"number\\" means the same thing in these two sentences, we'll have to analyze the context in which the word is used in each sentence. 1. In the first sentence, \\"She refused to give them her Social Security number,\\" the word \\"number\\" is used to refer to a unique series of digits assigned to an individual for identification in the social security system. In this context, \\"number\\" specifically refers to an identifying numerical code. 2. In the second sentence, \\"She preferred the black nylon number,\\" the word \\"number\\" doesn't seem to be referring to a numerical value or code. Instead, it's being used colloquially to refer to an item (in this case, a piece of clothing made of black nylon). In this context, \\"number\\" doesn't have a numerical meaning; instead, it denotes an object. Conclusion: Based on contextual analysis, \\"number\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences.

The move is the strongest indication yet of Amazon's intent to push further into the health-care industry. It threatens to remove one of the few distinguishing factors pharmacy chains have relied on to fend off Amazon, the sale of prescription drugs. Retailers like Walgreens Boots Alliance, CVS Health and Rite Aid have seen their so-called front of store sales threatened as shoppers increasingly buy household staples online or from convenience stores.      Shares of all three tanked Thursday on the news, along with drug distributors Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson. Rite Aid, Walgreens and CVS Health lost about 12.8 billion in market value on Thursday alone.      PillPack, which organizes and delivers packages of medications for consumers, is licensed to ship prescriptions in 49 states, according to its website.      \\"Yes, it's a declaration of intent from Amazon,\\" Walgreens Boots Alliance CEO Stefano Pessina acknowledged to analysts in a planned call to discuss its quarterly earnings, according to an initial transcript from FactSet. \\"[But] the pharmacy world is much more complex than the delivery of a certain [pills or] packages.\\"      Terms of the deal with Amazon were not disclosed, though people familiar with the matter told CNBC that Amazon paid roughly 1 billion. The companies expect it to close during the second half of the year.      The start-up has raised 118 million in funding from investors including CRV and Menlo Ventures, and it reached more than 100 million in revenue in 2017, the company has said. In 2016 it was reported to be valued at 330 million.      The company previously had sale talks with Walmart, which had considered buying the start-up for less than 1 billion, CNBC has reported. ||||| Amazon is buying online pharmacy PillPack — a move that could disrupt the drug store business.      PillPack has pharmacy licenses in all 50 states. The company delivers medications to customers in pre-sorted doses designed to make it easier for people to take multiple medications a day.      Amazon (AMZN) was widely expected to move into the pharmacy business.      And Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, is creating a health care company along with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA).      The PillPack deal is already scaring investors in the top two drug store chains.      CVS (CVS) fell 9% in early trading. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), the newest Dow component, plunged more than 10%. Walgreens was already trading lower after reporting a drop in same-store sales at its US pharmacies.      Related: Amazon is already trying to disrupt health care      Rite Aid (RAD) shares also fell, as did the stocks of big drug distributors Cardinal Health (CAH) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC).      These and other health care stocks rose a few months ago after reports that Amazon may not have been interested in selling prescription drugs. So much for that.      It's not clear yet just what Amazon plans for PillPack. Will it eventually merge it into a broader health care platform on Amazon or keep it independent as it has done with other subsidiaries like shoe retailer Zappos and video site Twitch?      The fact that PillPack is already licensed to sell prescriptions may persuade Amazon to keep it independent.      But all the companies said on Thursday was the deal was subject to some regulatory approvals and that the companies hope to close the transaction during the second half of this year.      Related: PillPack vs. Express Scripts -- People suffer when business turns ugly      Walgreens doesn't seem too worried.      During the company's earnings call Thursday morning, Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said in response to a question about the PillPack deal that the pharmacy business is \\"much more complex than just delivering certain pills or certain packages.\\"      Pessina added that physical pharmacies \\"will continue to be very, very important in the future.\\"      The PillPack acquisition comes just a week after CVS announced it will start delivering prescriptions to people's homes — a response to growing competition from PillPack and Capsule, another online pharmacy startup.      Related: Amazon wants you to start a business to deliver its packages      The health care industry is also in the midst of merger mania. CVS is buying insurer Aetna for while Cigna (CI), another insurer, is scooping up pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX). Both deals are valued at nearly 70 billion.      Those deals were announced after two mega insurer mergers were blocked by federal judges early last year on antitrust grounds. Aetna had hoped to combine with rival Humana (HUM) while Cigna was planning to merge with Anthem (ANTM). |||||Summary:","output":"Amazon is buying a company called PillPack, which is an online pharmacy. This is a big deal because it shows that Amazon wants to be a part of the health-care industry. When people heard about this, the value of big pharmacy companies went down a lot because they are worried about competing with Amazon. PillPack helps people get their medications in a way that is easy for them to take. Amazon might make some changes to PillPack in the future, but right now, they plan to buy the company and keep it working the same way."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The term \\"absentee ownership\\" was popularised by economist Thorstein Veblen's book of the same name, \\"Absentee ownership\\".  - Maria Edgeworth (1 January 1768  22 May 1849) was a prolific Anglo-Irish writer of adults' and children's literature. She was one of the first realist writers in children's literature and was a significant figure in the evolution of the novel in Europe. She held advanced views, for a woman of her time, on estate management, politics and education, and corresponded with some of the leading literary and economic writers, including Sir Walter Scott and David Ricardo.  - The Absentee is a novel by Maria Edgeworth, published in 1812 in \\"Tales of Fashionable Life\\", that expresses the systemic evils of the absentee landlord class of Anglo-Irish and the desperate condition of the Irish peasantry.  - The Gordon Riots of 1780 began as an anti-Catholic protest in London against the Papists Act of 1778, which was intended to reduce official discrimination against British Catholics. The protest evolved into riots and looting.  - A riot is a form of civil disorder commonly characterized by a group lashing out in a violent public disturbance against authority, property or people.

He saves a girl called Sarah from a horde of the reanimated dead, and they escape through the floor of a church. An evil necromancer named Mathias confronts Sarah and demands an amulet given to her by her uncle before he died. Sarah refuses, and after threatening to unleash all the evils he can conjure, Mathias disappears. In the morning, Sarah and Jacob return to Sarah's house through streets, fields, churches and underground tunnels, pursued by hordes of demonic creatures. They arrive around midday to find Mathias is already there, holding a sword to Sarah's little sister Jill's throat. Mathias threatens to kill Jill unless Sarah gives him the amulet. Sarah makes Mathias promise he will let Jill go, and gives him the amulet. Mathias disappears with both Jill and the necklace, and Sarah begs Jacob to go save Jill from Mathias. Jacob reluctantly agrees. Jacob arrives at Sarah's dead uncle's house and fights Mathias. He manages to destroy the amulet, defeating Mathias, but Jill falls through a hole in the floor. Jacob dives after her and breaks her fall with his own body, unharmed himself because he cannot die due to a protection spell that Sarah's uncle cast before he died. They return to Jill's home. Her mother and her sister Sarah are dead, killed by the reanimated dead while Jacob was not there to protect them. Jacob returns to Sarah's uncle's house to find Mathias reading through his necromancer spells, looking for a way to restore his power.

Presley's physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. \\"He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful\\", in the words of critic Mark Feeney. Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, \\"I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence.\\" His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as \\"the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl\\". In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as \\"the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America\\". Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, Sight and Sound's Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as \\"aggressively bisexual in appeal\\". Brett Farmer places the \\"orgasmic gyrations\\" of the title dance sequence in Jailhouse Rock within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a \\"spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image\\".

The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times.  - A registration county was, in Great Britain and Ireland, a statistical unit used for the registration of births, deaths and marriages and for the output of census information. In Scotland registration counties are used for land registration purposes.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about .

Please answer the following question: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers.  Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers owned two adjacent parcels of land. Tom's land was forested, while Bill's was covered with grasslands.  Answer this question please: Which parcel of land had soil with faster rates of decomposition? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided, I will analyze the two parcels of land step by step and determine which has faster rates of decomposition in the soil. Step 1: Compare the environments of the two parcels of land Tom's land is forested, characterized by thick humus layers, rich tree diversity, and abundant animal life. The precipitation in forests exceeds evapotranspiration, resulting in an excess of water percolating downward through the soil layers. In contrast, Bill's land is covered with grasslands, which typically have different vegetation and moisture conditions. Step 2: Assess the rates of decomposition In forested areas, like Tom's land, the background information states that there are slow rates of decomposition due to factors like cooler, shaded environments, and higher levels of moisture, which can create anaerobic conditions that slow microbial activity. This leads to large amounts of fulvic acid and enhanced chemical weathering. In grasslands, like Bill's land, decomposition tends to be faster due to factors like warmer temperatures, increased sunlight exposure, and generally more aerobic conditions, which encourage microbial activity. Step 3: Compare the rates of decomposition between the two parcels of land Based on the analysis in step 2, it is clear that decomposition rates in grasslands are generally faster than those in forested areas. Answer: Bill's parcel of land, which is covered with grasslands, has soil with faster rates of decomposition compared to Tom's forested land."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: where was kite runner filmed A:","output":"The Kite Runner, a film adaptation of the best-selling novel by Khaled Hosseini, was released in 2007, directed by Marc Forster. Even though the story is set in Afghanistan, the film was primarily shot in various locations outside of Afghanistan due to security concerns and ongoing unrest in the region. To answer your question, The Kite Runner was filmed primarily in and around the city of Kashgar in the Xinjiang region of China, which has a similar landscape and architectural style as Afghanistan. Kashgar provided a relatively safe environment for the filmmakers and served as a substitute for the Afghani city of Kabul. The Old Town of Kashgar, with its narrow streets, mud-brick houses, and bustling bazaars, offered an authentic backdrop for the story. Some of the film's scenes were also shot in the Taklamakan Desert, which lies in the southeastern portion of the Xinjiang region and shares characteristics with the deserts of Afghanistan. Moreover, a few portions of the film were shot in the San Francisco Bay Area in California, United States. The film's protagonist, Amir, immigrates to the United States, and the scenes depicting his life in America were filmed in the Bay Area as it provided a similar ambiance to the setting described in the novel. In terms of the actors, the child actors playing Amir and Hassan (Zekeria Ebrahimi and Ahmad Khan Mahmidzada, respectively) were native speakers of Dari, one of the primary languages spoken in Afghanistan. However, several adult actors, including Homayoun Ershadi (who played the role of Amir's father, Baba), and others had to learn Dari for their roles in the film. Overall, while The Kite Runner was not filmed in Afghanistan itself, the filmmakers went to great lengths to find suitable locations that could convincingly portray the story's essential settings. This attention to detail and cultural authenticity is evident in the film's visuals, helping to immerse the viewer in the story's world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ali Zeidan's office said he had asked for clarification and stressed Libya was \\"keen on prosecuting any Libyan citizen inside Libya\\". The raid captured al-Qaeda leader Anas al-Liby, a suspected mastermind of the 1998 US embassy attacks in Africa. US Secretary of State John Kerry said the suspect was a \\"legal target\\". Mr Kerry said Anas al-Liby would face justice in a court of law. On Saturday, US commandos also carried out a raid in southern Somalia but failed to capture its target. The US Navy Seals' seaborne raid was believed to have focused on a leader of the al-Shabab militant group, which says it carried out last month's attack on the Westgate shopping centre in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, leaving at least 67 people dead. By Frank GardnerBBC security correspondent This weekend's twin raids by US commandos to target America's enemies in Africa are the result of intensive planning by US intelligence agencies and Special Operations Command. The Libyan jihadist snatched on Saturday had been on the FBI's wanted list since 2001. Once informants on the ground in Libya had confirmed his exact location, it would have been relatively easy for the US Army Delta Force commandos to deploy from a US base in Europe. But targeting al-Shabab leaders believed responsible for the Nairobi Westgate attack has proved more difficult. Here, it seems US intelligence got it wrong on two counts: the wanted man was not at home and the Navy Seal commandos encountered far fiercer resistance than they had expected, forcing them to withdraw empty-handed. What this shows, though, is that in an era where Washington is trying to avoid getting drawn into costly overseas wars, it is nevertheless prepared to launch pinpoint raids like these, despite accusations it may be breaking international law. What did US raids achieve? A US official speaking on the condition of anonymity later identified the militant as Ikrima - a foreign fighter commander for al-Shabab in Somalia, Reuters reports. However, Washington has not formally named the intended target. When asked on Sunday whether Somalia had been aware of the raid, Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon Saaid said: \\"Our co-operation with international partners on fighting against terrorism is not a secret.\\" A press release posted on an official Libyan government website read: \\"The Libyan government is following the news about the Libyan citizen wanted by the US government. \\"Since we've heard, we have been in touch with the US government and have asked for clarification on this matter. \\"The Libyan government is keen on prosecuting any Libyan citizen inside Libya, no matter what the charges are... the accused are innocent until proven guilty.\\" The statement raises questions about how much, if anything, Libya knew in advance of the raid. A US official had been quoted by CNN as saying that the raid was conducted with the knowledge of the Libyan government. Anas al-Liby, 49, is believed to have been one of the masterminds behind the 1998 US embassy attacks, which killed more than 220 people in Kenya and Tanzania. He has been indicted in a New York court in connection with the attacks. Profile: Anas al-Liby Liby - whose real name is Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai - has been on the FBI's most wanted list for more than a decade with a 5m (£3.1m) bounty on his head. A Pentagon statement on Sunday said he was \\"currently lawfully detained under the law of war in a secure location outside of Libya\\". It said: \\"The successful capture operation was made possible by superb work and co-ordination across our national security agencies and the intelligence community, and was approved by President Obama.\\" No American personnel were injured, it said. Anas al-Liby was seized in Tripoli early on Saturday as he was parking outside his house. Three vehicles encircled him, his car window was smashed and his gun was seized before he was taken away, his brother, Nabih, told the Associated Press news agency. On Sunday he told reporters that his brother was innocent, describing the US operation was an \\"act of piracy\\". Liby's son, Abdullah, said that those he could see taking his father looked Libyan and spoke a Libyan dialect. He said that some were masked. Mr Kerry said the operations in Libya and Somalia showed that the US would never stop \\"in its effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror\\". Those who attacked American interests \\"can run but they can't hide\\", he said. The US defence department also confirmed that special forces had carried out a seaborne operation in Somalia's coastal town of Barawe on Saturday. Pentagon spokesman George Little said the forces had been \\"involved in a counter-terrorism operation against a known al-Shabab terrorist\\". He gave no further details. Initial reports in the US media quoted unnamed US officials as saying that the suspect had been captured or killed by US Navy Seals in the pre-dawn raid on a villa. However, the officials later said that the Seals failed to find the intended target. Prime Minister Saiid said on Sunday: \\"We have collaboration with the world and with neighbouring countries in the battle against al Shabab... our interest is to get a peaceful Somalia, free from terrorism.\\" The raid was carried out by members of Seal Team Six - the same unit that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, a US military official told AP. The official added that in Barawe the commandos had decided to abort the mission after encountering fierce resistance from al-Shabab fighters. \\"The Barawe raid was planned a week and a half ago,\\" a US security official told the New York Times. \\"It was prompted by the Westgate attack,\\" added the official, who was speaking on the condition of anonymity. Al-Shabab earlier told the BBC that \\"white soldiers\\" had arrived by boat in Barawe and rebels had repulsed them, losing a fighter. What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses two separate raids conducted by US commandos in Libya and Somalia. The first raid captured Anas al-Liby, an al-Qaeda leader and suspected mastermind of the 1998 US embassy attacks in Africa. The Libyan government requested clarification regarding the operation and emphasized its commitment to prosecute Libyan citizens within the country. The second raid, in Somalia, targeted a leader of the al-Shabab militant group allegedly responsible for the Westgate shopping center attack in Kenya, although it did not capture the intended target. The two operations signal that the US is willing to carry out pinpoint raids on enemies, despite potential accusations of breaching international law."},{"instruction":"Question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

That is, I know that one of the assembled students was the culprit for some activity. When they will not talk, I interview them one at a time while the others are kept away from each other. Then when they are assembled before me again, I say, “Thank you gentlemen. I know who did it so you others are free to return to class.” All but one arises and leaves. This works more times than not.

Young child - the subject is a young child. 2. Plays on a swing set - the action is the child playing on a swing set. 3. Construction workers dig - additional subjects are construction workers, and their action is digging. 4. In the background - indicates the spatial relationship between the child and the construction workers. Hypothesis: 1. A kid - the subject is a kid, synonym for a young child. 2. Swings - the action is the kid swinging. 3. Workers in hardhats - additional subjects are workers wearing hardhats. 4. Use a bulldozer - the action is the workers using a bulldozer. Now, let's compare the components to see if the hypothesis can be considered true if the premise is true. 1. Young child vs. a kid: These are essentially the same, so this part could be true. 2. Plays on a swing set vs. swings: The child playing on a swing set could mean that the child is actively swinging, but it could also mean that they are simply playing on the swing set without explicitly swinging. Thus, this part cannot be definitively proven true or false based on the premise. 3. Construction workers dig vs. workers in hardhats: The premise states construction workers are digging but does not mention hardhats. However, it is reasonable to assume that construction workers would be wearing hardhats, being a common safety precaution in construction sites. Despite this assumption not explicitly present in the premise, it could be considered plausible. 4. In the background vs. use a bulldozer: The premise states that the construction workers are digging in the background and does not mention any specific tools or machinery. The hypothesis mentions a bulldozer, which is not present in the premise. Thus, based on the given information, this part of the hypothesis cannot be considered true solely based on the premise. In conclusion, although some aspects of the hypothesis align with the information provided in the premise, other parts do not have enough evidence or are not explicitly present in the premise. Consequently, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His father and Philip II had done so at Gisors on 21 January 1188 after receiving news of the fall of Jerusalem to Saladin. After Richard became king, he and Philip agreed to go on the Third Crusade, since each feared that during his absence the other might usurp his territories.  Richard swore an oath to renounce his past wickedness in order to show himself worthy to take the cross. He started to raise and equip a new crusader army. He spent most of his father's treasury (filled with money raised by the Saladin tithe), raised taxes, and even agreed to free King William I of Scotland from his oath of subservience to Richard in exchange for 10,000 marks. To raise still more revenue he sold the right to hold official positions, lands, and other privileges to those interested in them. Those already appointed were forced to pay huge sums to retain their posts. William Longchamp, Bishop of Ely and the King's Chancellor, made a show of bidding PS3,000 to remain as Chancellor. He was apparently outbid by a certain Reginald the Italian, but that bid was refused.  Richard made some final arrangements on the continent. He reconfirmed his father's appointment of William Fitz Ralph to the important post of seneschal of Normandy. In Anjou, Stephen of Tours was replaced as seneschal and temporarily imprisoned for fiscal mismanagement. Payn de Rochefort, an Angevin knight, was elevated to the post of seneschal of Anjou. In Poitou the ex-provost of Benon, Peter Bertin, was made seneschal, and finally in Gascony the household official Helie de La Celle was picked for the seneschalship there. After repositioning the part of his army he left behind to guard his French possessions, Richard finally set out on the crusade in summer 1190. (His delay was criticised by troubadours such as Bertran de Born.) He appointed as regents Hugh de Puiset, Bishop of Durham, and William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex--who soon died and was replaced by Richard's chancellor William Longchamp.

It's axiomatic that all cultures reserve a special place for food in their daily and social lives. For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus. When we met him, he must have been in his forties but looked to us adolescents to be older than Father Time. He was immediately dubbed 'Grandpa Munster'. With the tender sensitivity of males of our age, we didn't bother to hide this from him and he took it in good humour.

Find a good spot: Look for a flat and even area in your yard, like the perfect spot to play with toy cars. 2. Measure and mark the area: Let's use a big ruler called a tape measure to know how big the shed will be, and put some markers in the ground as if we were drawing a big square. 3. Prepare the ground: Now, we'll need to clear that square area we marked, removing any grass and making it super flat, just like your toy cars road. 4. Build a frame: We'll use some long wooden pieces, like the sticks you use to build with blocks, to create a big square frame. This will be the outline of the shed floor. 5. Set up support: To make sure the floor is strong, we will place more wooden pieces across that big square frame, just like when you make a tic-tac-toe board. 6. Lay the floor: Now, it's time to put down some big flat wooden pieces, like puzzle pieces, across the tic-tac-toe board we made. This will be our strong and flat floor for the shed. 7. Make sure it's all perfect: Finally, we'll use a special tool called a level to make sure our floor is straight and not tilting anywhere. And there you have it!

This means that cities with large populations have the biggest problem of dirty air. Air pollution is caused by many different things. A major source of air pollution is the gas fumes from cars. Statistics show that 93 percent of all auto trips are within cities. Another major source of dirty air is the burning of coal and oil for energy. This energy is needed to make electricity. Of course, much more electricity is used in the city than in the country. On the average, we throw away more trash and garbage than the year before. The burning of garbage contributes to air pollution. Many major industries are also responsible for the dirty air in the around cities. The fumes from iron, steel, chemical, and petroleum production add particles to the air. The effects of air pollution range from mild headaches to death. The levels of pollution found in heavy for traffic may cause headaches for loss of clear vision. Wherever coal and oil are used for fuel, fumes may kill trees and plants and cause metal to corrode. In some of the larger cities, these fumes endanger the live of human beings by contributing to lung diseases and causing early death. Question: The fumes from coal and oil may cause metal   _  .

Given the question: One of the most striking findings of a recent questionnaire in the UK is that of the people interviewed, one in two believes that it is becoming more difficult to meet someone to start a family with. Why are many people finding it increasingly difficult to start and keep close relationships? Does modern life really make it harder to fall in love? Or are we making it harder for ourselves? It is certainly the case today that nowadays couples benefit in different ways from relationships. Women no longer rely upon partners for economic security or status. A man doesn't expect his wife to be in sole   charge of running his household and raising his children. But perhaps the knowledge that we can live perfectly well without a partnership means that it takes much more to persuade people to abandon their independence. In theory, finding a partner should be much simpler these days. Only a few generations ago,your choice of soul mate was limited by geography, social convention and family tradition. Although it was never clear, many marriages were essentially arranged. Now those barriers have been broken down. You can approach a builder or a brain surgeon in any bar in any city on any given evening. When the world is your oyster , you surely have a better chance of finding a pearl. But it seems that the traditions have been replaced by an even tighter restriction:the limitation of choice. The expectations of partners are made greater to an unmanageable degree:good looks, impressive salary, kind to grandmother, and so on. There is no room for error in the first impression. We think that a relationship can be perfect. If it isn't,it is intended to be thrown away. We work to protect ourselves against future heartache and don't put in the hard emotional labor needed to build a strong relationship.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation when vegetarianism happens is indirectly impacting a step of the process.  When someone becomes a vegetarian, they primarily consume plant-based foods, which excludes meat and sometimes other animal products. Though the overall digestive process remains the same, it might impact some steps indirectly. For example, plant-based foods tend to be higher in fiber, which can lead to changes in the breakdown and digestion process. Fiber can help move food through the gastrointestinal tract more efficiently and improve digestive health. While the overall process and steps of breaking down food remain the same, the content of the ingested food (e.g., more fiber and carbohydrates, less fat and protein) may affect the rate and efficiency of digestion.

It was a very dreadful game for Danny. But hard as it was for Danny, it didn't begin to be as hard as the game Lightfoot the Deer was playing with the hunter in the Green Forest.  In the case of Buster Bear and Danny, the latter had simply to keep out of reach of Buster. As long as Buster didn't get his great paws on Danny, the latter was safe. Then, too, Danny is a very small person. He is so small that he can hide under two or three leaves. Wherever he is, he is pretty sure to find a hiding-place of some sort. His small size gives him advantages in a game of hide and seek. It certainly does. But Lightfoot the Deer is big. He is one of the largest of the people who live in the Green Forest. Being so big, it is not easy to hide.  Moreover, a hunter with a terrible gun does not have to get close in order to kill. Lightfoot knew all this as he waited for the coming of the hunter of whom Sammy Jay had warned him. He had learned many lessons in the hunting season of the year before and he remembered every one of them. He knew that to forget even one of them might cost him his life. So, standing motionless behind a tangle of fallen trees, Lightfoot listened and watched.  What are the answers to this following set of questions: 1. Who can kill from a distance? 2. With what? 3.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Carignan (also known as Mazuelo, Bovale Grande, Cariñena, Samsó, and Carignane) is a red Spanish/French wine grape variety that is widely planted throughout the western Mediterranean and around the globe. Along with Aramon, it was once considered one of the main grapes responsible for France's wine lake and was a substantial producer in jug wine production in California's Central Valley.  - A Bordeaux wine is any wine produced in the Bordeaux region of France, centred on the city of Bordeaux and covering the whole area of the Gironde department, with a total vineyard area of over 120,000 hectares, making it the largest wine growing area in France. Average vintages produce over 700 million bottles of Bordeaux wine, ranging from large quantities of everyday table wine, to some of the most expensive and prestigious wines in the world. The vast majority of wine produced in Bordeaux is red (called \\"claret\\" in Britain), with sweet white wines (most notably Sauternes), dry whites, and (in much smaller quantities) rosé and sparkling wines (Crémant de Bordeaux) collectively making up the remainder. Bordeaux wine is made by more than 8,500 producers or \\"châteaux\\". There are 54 appellations of Bordeaux wine.  - French wine is produced all throughout France, in quantities between 50 and 60 million hectolitres per year, or 78 billion bottles. France is one of the largest wine producers in the world. French wine traces its history to the 6th century BC, with many of France's regions dating their wine-making history to Roman times. The wines produced range from expensive high-end wines sold internationally to more modest wines usually only seen within France such as the Margnat wines were during the post war period.  - Vitis (grapevines) is a genus of 79 accepted species of vining plants in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. The genus is made up of species predominantly from the Northern hemisphere. It is economically important as the source of grapes, both for direct consumption of the fruit and for fermentation to produce wine. The study and cultivation of grapevines is called viticulture.  - A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus \\"Vitis\\".  - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.  - Ruby Cabernet is a red Olmo grape variety that is a cross between Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan , it can produce wines with good colour and a pleasant cherry flavour , but is mostly blended into bulk wines . The purpose for the creation of the crossing of the grape varieties utilized to produce Ruby Cabernet was to obtain the superior quality of a Cabernet wine , and the resistance to heat of the Carignan combined in an inexpensive table wine . Even though the wine made from these grapes does not possess the distinctive flavor and the overall structure of other types of Cabernet wines , it does carry their fruitful essence . The grape for this type of red wine was developed for California 's hot climate , specially for regions such as the San Joaquin and the Napa Valleys . Ruby Cabernet has improved the quality of the bulk wines produced in these areas thanks to its natural , special acidity .  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - The Beqaa Valley (',  ), also transliterated as Bekaa, Biqâ and Becaa and known in Classical antiquity as Coele-Syria, is a fertile valley in eastern Lebanon. It is Lebanon's most important farming region. Industry also flourishes in Beqaa, especially that related to agriculture.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Deciduous means \\"falling off at maturity\\" \\" or \\"tending to fall off\\", and it is typically used in order to refer to trees or shrubs that lose their leaves seasonally (most commonly during autumn) and to the shedding of other plant structures such as petals after flowering or fruit when ripe. In a more general sense, \\"deciduous\\" means \\"the dropping of a part that is no longer needed\\" or \\"falling away after its purpose is finished\\". In plants it is the result of natural processes. \\"Deciduous\\" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous antlers in deer or deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, in some mammals (including humans).  - The wine lake refers to the continuing supply surplus of wine produced in the European Union. A major contributor to that glut is the Languedoc-Roussillon, which produces over one-third of the grapes grown in France. In 2007 it was reported that for the previous several vintages, European countries had been producing 1.7 billion more bottles of wine than they sell. Hundreds of millions of bottles of wine are turned into industrial alcohol every year, a practice that is sometimes described as \\"emergency distillation\\".  - Wine (from Latin \\"vinum\\") is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. These grapes are generally \\"Vitis vinifera,\\" or a hybrid with \\"Vitis labrusca\\" or \\"Vitis rupestris\\". Grapes are fermented without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production.  - Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the world's most widely recognized red wine grape varieties. It is grown in nearly every major wine producing country among a diverse spectrum of climates from Canada's Okanagan Valley to Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon became internationally recognized through its prominence in Bordeaux wines where it is often blended with Merlot and Cabernet Franc. From France, the grape spread across Europe and to the New World where it found new homes in places like California's Santa Cruz Mountains, Napa Valley, New Zealand's Hawkes Bay, Australia's Margaret River and Coonawarra regions, and Chile's Maipo Valley and Colchagua. For most of the 20th century, it was the world's most widely planted premium red wine grape until it was surpassed by Merlot in the 1990s.  - The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (\\"angeion\\", \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and \\"sperma\\", \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds.  - A vine (Latin \\"vnea\\" \\"grapevine\\", \\"vineyard\\", from \\"vnum\\" \\"wine\\") in the narrowest sense is the grapevine (\\"Vitis\\"), but more generally it can refer to any plant with a growth habit of trailing or (that is, climbing) stems or runners. The word also can refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance when used in wicker work.  - \\"Jug wine\\" is a term in the United States for inexpensive table wine (or \\"bulk wine\\") typically bottled in a glass jug.   - Merlot is a dark blue-colored wine grape variety, that is used as both a blending grape and for varietal wines. The name \\"Merlot\\" is thought to be a diminutive of \\"merle\\", the French name for the blackbird, probably a reference to the color of the grape. Its softness and \\"fleshiness\\", combined with its earlier ripening, makes Merlot a popular grape for blending with the sterner, later-ripening Cabernet Sauvignon, which tends to be higher in tannin.  - Cabernet Franc is one of the major black grape varieties worldwide. It is principally grown for blending with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the Bordeaux style, but can also be vinified alone, as in the Loire's Chinon. In addition to being used in blends and produced as a varietal in Canada and the United States, it is made into ice wine in those regions.    What is the relationship between 'ruby cabernet' and 'varietal'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'Ruby Cabernet' and 'varietal' lies in the fact that Ruby Cabernet is a specific type of grape variety used in winemaking, while 'varietal' refers to a wine produced primarily from a single grape variety. A varietal wine highlights the unique characteristics of that particular grape variety, without the influence of other grape types. In this context, Ruby Cabernet can be used as a varietal wine, showcasing the specific qualities and flavors of the Ruby Cabernet grape, a cross between Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan. However, Ruby Cabernet is often blended with other grape varieties to enhance the overall taste and quality of the wine produced."},{"instruction":"Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Whose concert did people show up at daybreak to secure a good spot for?

Luckily, it’s not difficult to avoid situations in which throwing is required, and I’ve managed to do it successfully my entire adult life. Except that one time.      A decade or so ago, in New York, a ball came flying over an 18-foot schoolyard fence just as I was passing by. There was no one I could hand it off to, and a gaggle of fifth-graders was waiting for me to toss it back. I had so little faith in my overarm throwing that I had to go underhand. The squeal of brakes was my first indication that the ball had ended up behind me, in the middle of Columbus Avenue. The best I can say about this incident is that nobody got hurt.      I know I’m not the only woman with that kind of story. As much as the expression grates, girls do, in general, throw like girls.      Janet Hyde, a professor of psychology and women’s studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, has studied the gender gap across a broad spectrum of skills. She believes that men and women aren’t as different as they are often portrayed, and she has mined data on social, psychological, communication and physical traits, skills and behaviors to quantify the gap. After looking at 46 meta-analyses, Hyde found what she defined as a “very large” difference in only two skills: throwing velocity and throwing distance.      Photo shows Harvard softball coach Jenny Allard demonstrating proper technique for throwing overhand. (CJ Gunther/FOR THE WASHINGTON POST)      The throwing gap has been researched for more than half a century, and the results have been consistent. According to Jerry Thomas, dean of the College of Education at the University of North Texas in Denton, who did the throwing research Hyde cites in her paper, “The overhand throwing gap, beginning at 4 years of age, is three times the difference of any other motor task, and it just gets bigger across age. By 18, there’s hardly any overlap in the distribution: Nearly every boy by age 15 throws better than the best girl.”      Around the world, at all ages, boys throw better — a lot better — than girls. Studies of overhand ball throwing across different cultures have found that pre-pubescent girls throw 51 to 69 percent of the distance that boys do, at 51 to 78 percent of the velocity. As they get older, the differences increase; one U.S. study found that girls age 14 to 18 threw only 39 percent as far as boys (an average of about 75 feet vs. about 192 feet). The question is why.      Since boys generally learn to throw young and do more throwing than girls do, it would make sense that they’re better at it, and Thomas acknowledges the nurture component. “The gap is much larger than it should be, and it would be smaller if girls got more practice,” he says.      To try to distinguish nature from nurture, Thomas studied aboriginal Australian children, who grow up in a culture where both men and women hunt, and both sexes throw from childhood. “Our hypothesis was that [the aboriginal] girls would be better throwers and not as different from the boys as in European, Chinese, Australian and all the U.S. cultures.”      The data bore him out. Aboriginal girls threw tennis balls at 78.3 percent of the velocity of boys — closer to boys than in most other cultures, but still significantly slower. (Throwing distance wasn’t measured.)      Size and strength undoubtedly also play a role, but girls and boys are about the same size as children, when there is a significant gap in overhand throwing skill. The gap widens at puberty, when the advantages of size and strength kick in.      Like a dart, not a ball      To understand why a girl “throws like a girl,” it’s necessary to define just what throwing like a girl is. According to Thomas, a girl throwing overhand looks more like she’s throwing a dart than a ball. It’s a slow, weak, forearm motion, with a short step on the same side as the throwing hand. A boy’s throw, by contrast, involves the entire body. Thomas describes a skillful overhand throw as an uncoiling in three phases: step (with the foot opposite the throwing hand), rotate (with hips first, then shoulders) and whip (with the arm and hand).      Girls don’t do any of those three steps as successfully as boys, but Thomas zeroes in on one aspect in particular: the rotation.      The power in an overhand throw — and in a golf swing, a tennis serve or a baseball swing — comes from the separate turning of hips and shoulders. The hips rotate forward and the body opens, and then the shoulders snap around. Women tend to rotate their hips and shoulders together, and even expert women throwers don’t get the differential that men get. “The one-piece rotation is the biggest difference,” says Thomas. “It keeps women from creating speed at the hand.” Even when women learn to rotate hips and shoulders separately, they don’t do it as fast as men.      There doesn’t appear to be a muscular or structural reason for the difference.      “Men have wider shoulders, which translates to higher velocity at ball release. They’re bigger and stronger, and you could argue they can rotate their body faster, but the women have less mass to rotate,” Thomas says. The difference, he suspects, isn’t in the arm or the torso or the shoulder. “I’d bet my bottom dollar there’s something neurological. It’s the nervous system.”      This explanation, while not explicitly provable, would make evolutionary sense. “Men threw rocks, and, if you could throw well, you got the women,” Thomas points out. “Women did the gathering, and often brought a baby with them. People have speculated that [one-piece] rotation came from women having to throw while holding a baby.”      Thomas points out that a biological explanation isn’t palatable to everyone. “If you say something is biological.” he says, “people think you should just give up and go home.” Janet Hyde agrees: “The more we argue for gender differences, the more we feed people’s stereotypes. A belief in large gender differences is incompatible with equal opportunity.” Still, Hyde readily acknowledges that there are some biological differences, and throwing is one of them.      Thomas doesn’t want to give up and go home. “People don’t like to talk about it because girls will give up, but perhaps if we talk about it, girls can learn. And they can learn.”      Taking a lesson      Jenny Allard, coach of the Harvard women’s softball team, is doing the teaching. “Overhand throwing is the most undertaught skill in softball,” she says. “Girls tend to keep their limbs close to their body, and not rotate at all, If they do rotate, they rotate their entire body.” She sees the problem even at the elite level. “I saw a potential recruit who was fast as lightning, and a great hitter. But she throws . . . ” Allard shrugs. “Like a girl.” She uses the expression without apology.      Allard, a former all-American softball player who has coached at Harvard for 18 years, believes women can and should be taught to throw. Could she teach me? “Absolutely.”      So I went to Harvard to learn. Allard met me with a ball and two gloves, and we walked out to the softball field.      After warming up by tossing the ball back and forth at a distance of about 20 feet, we needed to test how far I could throw so we could track my improvement. I went to home plate and gave it my all. I couldn’t get the ball to first base, 60 feet away. Fifty-five was the best I could do.      Allard then gave me a straightforward lesson in the basic overhand throwing motion. It broke down Thomas’s three steps, in reverse order. I first practiced the whip of the arm and hand, then the extension backward and rotation forward, and then the step with the opposite foot. The lesson took about half an hour.      After it, we went back to home plate. Thomas had warned that simply learning the motion wouldn’t work miracles, so I didn’t expect one. And I didn’t get one. But I did get the ball to first base, and even a little beyond: That was a 10 percent improvement in just 30 minutes.      I told Allard that I’d been cautioned that instruction without practice doesn’t help much. “Neither does practice without instruction,” she said. She put a ball and a glove in my hand and sent me home.      I have been practicing. And although I’m not breaking any records, for the first time in my life, I can throw a ball with something resembling confidence. And how many girls can say that?      Haspel is a freelance writer based on Cape Cod. ||||| There’s no way around it. I throw like a girl.      Luckily, it’s not difficult to avoid situations in which throwing is required, and I’ve managed to do it successfully my entire adult life. Except that one time.      A decade or so ago, in New York, a ball came flying over an 18-foot schoolyard fence just as I was passing by. There was no one I could hand it off to, and a gaggle of fifth-graders was waiting for me to toss it back. I had so little faith in my overarm throwing that I had to go underhand. The squeal of brakes was my first indication that the ball had ended up behind me, in the middle of Columbus Avenue. The best I can say about this incident is that nobody got hurt.      I know I’m not the only woman with that kind of story. As much as the expression grates, girls do, in general, throw like girls.      Janet Hyde, a professor of psychology and women’s studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, has studied the gender gap across a broad spectrum of skills. She believes that men and women aren’t as different as they are often portrayed, and she has mined data on social, psychological, communication and physical traits, skills and behaviors to quantify the gap. After looking at 46 meta-analyses, Hyde found what she defined as a “very large” difference in only two skills: throwing velocity and throwing distance.      Photo shows Harvard softball coach Jenny Allard demonstrating proper technique for throwing overhand. (CJ Gunther/FOR THE WASHINGTON POST)      The throwing gap has been researched for more than half a century, and the results have been consistent. According to Jerry Thomas, dean of the College of Education at the University of North Texas in Denton, who did the throwing research Hyde cites in her paper, “The overhand throwing gap, beginning at 4 years of age, is three times the difference of any other motor task, and it just gets bigger across age. By 18, there’s hardly any overlap in the distribution: Nearly every boy by age 15 throws better than the best girl.”      Around the world, at all ages, boys throw better — a lot better — than girls.

Pretend you're cold. Draw attention to your own lips. Article:","output":"Title: Captivate His Attention: Secrets to Creating a Lasting Impression Introduction In the dynamic world of dating and relationships, there is a myriad of subtle tactics that can be employed to strengthen the connection and establish a deeper sense of intimacy between two people. Whether you have been in a relationship for years or are just entering the dating scene, these simple yet effective strategies can improve your communication skills and give you the confidence you need to make a great impression. In this article, we will dive deep into six secrets that can help you create a lasting impact on your partner: making eye contact, being inviting, breaking the touch barrier, looking at his lips, lingering when saying goodbye, and drawing attention to your own lips. 1. Make Eye Contact Establishing and maintaining eye contact is one of the most powerful ways to create an emotional connection with someone. Eyes are known as the window to the soul, making eye contact with your partner allows you to express your feelings without even saying a word. By looking directly into his eyes, you are sending a message of trust, confidence, and genuine interest in what he has to say. Moreover, eye contact also helps in strengthening non-verbal communication between couples, leading to a deeper understanding of each other's thoughts and needs. 2. Be Inviting In any relationship, comfort is key. By creating an environment of warmth and openness, you make it easier for your partner to approach you and feel closer to you. Being inviting involves not only your words but also your body language. Maintaining an open posture, leaning in slightly during conversation, and nodding your head in agreement can all convey a sense of receptiveness that will help your partner feel more comfortable. Additionally, using a warm tone of voice and displaying genuine interest in his thoughts can make him feel valued and appreciated, fostering a stronger bond. 3. Break the Touch Barrier Touch is an incredibly important aspect of human connection, and one that is often overlooked in the early stages of a relationship. Breaking the touch barrier can be as simple as placing a hand on his arm during conversation or offering a hug in greeting. These seemingly small gestures can create an immediate sense of closeness and trust. As your relationship progresses, further explore ways to deepen your physical connection through touch – hand-holding, embracing, and even more intimate forms of contact can all strengthen the bond between you and your partner. 4. Look at His Lips A slightly unconventional tip, but one that can be incredibly effective in creating a sense of desire and intrigue. Occasionally glancing at your partner's lips during conversation can speak volumes about your attraction to him. This subtle non-verbal cue can make him more aware of your feelings and may inspire a reciprocal response, creating an environment ripe for deepening your connection. 5. Linger When Saying Goodbye Goodbyes can be a bittersweet moment, and adding a touch of lingering to your departure can create an impactful end to your interaction with your partner. When saying goodbye, make sure to maintain eye contact and consider adding a gentle touch to emphasize your connection. Whether you are sharing a hug or a simple wave, linger for a few moments longer than usual to leave your partner with a lasting impression of your time together. 6. Pretend You're Cold and Draw Attention to Your Lips Sometimes, it is the more subtle tactics that can have the most significant impact. By pretending that you are cold, you have the opportunity to wrap your arms around yourself, drawing attention to your lips and prompting your partner's protective instincts. This can be an opportunity to create a sense of closeness and intimacy, especially when followed by the other tips mentioned in this article. Conclusion Ultimately, creating a lasting impression in a relationship involves a combination of many factors – from effective communication to simple gestures. By focusing on making eye contact, being inviting and warm, breaking the touch barrier, looking at his lips, lingering when saying goodbye, and drawing attention to your lips, you can create a lasting impact on your partner and strengthen your bond. These seemingly small actions can weave a powerful story, one that transcends words and creates a foundation for a fulfilling and passionate relationship. So go ahead, put these tips into practice, and watch your connection with your partner flourish in new, exciting ways."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Yosemite Sam is the royal chef for a spoiled king (a caricature of Charles Laughton, who frequently played kings and similar heads of state).  On his way back to the castle from grocery shopping, Sam complains that the king never thanks him for his hard work in having to both pick up groceries and prepare meals three times every day, but that the king instead whines that Sam takes too long with preparing the meals, much to Sam's annoyance (\\"Cook!  Cook! Where's my lunch? Where's my dinner?\\"). This drives Sam to the point where he insults the king behind his back. After Sam prepares the king's latest meal, which consists of \\"Cornish Hen a la Westchester\\" and \\"Prime Rib of Mutton au Jus with kreplach Sauce Bordelaise,\\" the king just kicks the dishes away and orders Sam to take it all away.  He then tells Sam he's fed up with having \\"variety\\" at his meals.  Wanting something different for real, the king orders Sam to fix him some hasenpfeffer.  Sam agrees to carry out the king's request, but doesn't know what hasenpfeffer is.  When Sam checks back just to make sure the king said the right word, the king answers the question by throwing a bowl of custard into Sam's face.

Write the answer: Which country became the first sovereign state of the 21st century when Indonesia relinquished control on it in May 2002?","output":"The country that became the first sovereign state of the 21st century when Indonesia relinquished control on it in May 2002 is East Timor, also known as Timor-Leste. East Timor is situated in Southeast Asia, specifically on the eastern half of the island of Timor, which is located between Indonesia and Australia. It also includes the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco, as well as the exclave Oecusse, an East Timorese territory surrounded by Indonesian West Timor. The country's capital city is Dili, and the official languages are Tetum and Portuguese. The nation has a population of around 1.3 million people. The path to Timor-Leste's sovereignty was long and marked by a turbulent history of colonial rule, occupation, and struggle for self-determination. For over 400 years, Portugal colonized the eastern part of Timor island. In November 1975, following the Carnation Revolution and the withdrawal of Portuguese colonial administration, East Timor claimed independence as the Democratic Republic of East Timor. However, only nine days later, the Indonesian military invaded the country and subsequently occupied it, leading to a brutal 24-year-long occupation. During their occupation, Indonesian forces committed numerous atrocities against the Timorese population, causing an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 deaths. East Timor's struggle for independence continued, with the support of international solidarity movements, and eventually led to a critical turning point in 1999. In the wake of international pressure, the newly elected Indonesian president, B.J. Habibie, agreed to hold a UN-sponsored referendum in East Timor, where the people could choose between autonomy within Indonesia or independence. On August 30, 1999, the people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly for independence, with 78.5% favoring the separation from Indonesia. Unfortunately, the vote was followed by widespread violence and destruction committed by pro-Indonesian militias and Indonesian military personnel. The United Nations intervened, and an Australian-led International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) was deployed to restore peace and security. The UN established the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) to oversee the transition to independence, which included drafting a constitution and organizing elections. In 2002, Xanana Gusmão, a prominent independence activist and former guerrilla fighter, was elected the nation's first president. Finally, on May 20, 2002, East Timor declared its formal independence as a sovereign state, becoming the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, the first new sovereign nation of the 21st century. Since gaining independence, Timor-Leste has met with a multitude of challenges, including political instability, economic development, and nation-building tasks. Numerous international and regional organizations, such as the United Nations and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), have provided significant support to enable Timor-Leste's growth and progress. While there is still much work to be done, the people of Timor-Leste continue their journey towards building a stable and prosperous nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You can make people happier, healthier and more hard-working just by touching their arms or holding their hands. Doctors say that body contact is a kind of medicine that can work wonders. When people are touched, the quantity of hemoglobin  -a type of matter that produces the red color in blood increases greatly. This results in more oxygen reaching every part of the body and the whole body benefits. In experiments, bottle-fed baby monkeys were separated from their mothers for the first ten days of life. They became sad and negative. Studies showed the monkeys were more probable to become ill than other babies that were allowed to stay with their mothers. Human babies react in much the same way. Some years ago, a scientist noticed that some well-fed babies in a clean nursery became weak. Yet babies in another nursery were growing healthily, even though they ate less well and were not kept as clean. The reason, he concluded, was that they often had touches from nurses. Experiments show that most people like being touched. And nearly all doctors believe touch helps to reduce patients' fear of treatment. Of course there is time when a touch is not welcome.

Here is a goal: To boil butter, you can Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of boiling butter, there are multiple methods available. However, boiling butter is not a recommended cooking technique, as the high heat can cause the milk solids within the butter to burn. Instead, clarifying or browning the butter are more effective methods to achieve the desired result without causing issues. Below are descriptions of the methods, and the ideal circumstances in which to use each. 1. Clarifying Butter Clarifying butter means melting the butter and separating the milk solids from the fat, which results in a clear, golden liquid. Clarified butter has a higher smoke point and can be used for high-heat cooking methods, such as sauteing, frying, or even as a dipping sauce. To clarify butter, follow these steps: a. Cut the butter into small, even cubes to ensure uniform melting. b. Place the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat. c. Allow the butter to melt slowly, without stirring. d. As the butter melts, the milk solids will separate and sink to the bottom of the pan, and a white foam will form on the surface. e. Skim off the foam carefully with a spoon and discard it. f. Once the foam has been removed, carefully pour the clarified butter into a heatproof container, ensuring the milk solids at the bottom of the pan are left behind. 2. Browning Butter Browning butter, also known as beurre noisette, is a process where the butter is cooked until the milk solids turn a golden brown color, giving the butter a rich, nutty flavor. Browned butter is used as a flavorful addition to sauces, baked goods, and even on top of cooked vegetables or meats. To brown butter, follow these steps: a. Cut the butter into small, even cubes for uniform melting. b. Place the butter in a heavy-bottomed, light-colored pan over medium heat. A light-colored pan is preferred, as it will make it easier to monitor the color of the butter. c. Stir the butter continuously as it melts to prevent burning. d. Once the butter has melted, continue stirring as it starts to foam and sizzle. At this point, the milk solids will begin to turn brown. e. Keep a close eye on the color of the butter. When it reaches a golden brown color and emits a nutty aroma, remove the pan from heat. f. Pour the browned butter into a heatproof container to stop the cooking process, leaving any dark brown particles or burnt milk solids behind in the pan. In conclusion, while boiling butter is not a recommended technique, clarifying and browning butter are two effective methods to achieve a desired outcome when cooking with butter. Both methods provide distinct benefits depending on the dish you are preparing. Clarified butter works best for high-heat cooking methods due to its high smoke point, while browned butter imparts a deep, nutty flavor to a variety of dishes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most public polls leading up to Election Day had Democrat Terry McAuliffe coasting to victory, some by double digits, in the Virginia governor’s race. Instead he squeaked by, beating Republican Ken Cuccinelli by less than 3 percentage points.      Text Size -      +      reset McAuliffe victory speech Cuccinelli concession speech      The much-closer-than-expected outcome blunts the narrative that this was a clean win for Democrats going into 2014 and guarantees an intense blame game among Republicans about what might have put Cuccinelli over the top.      (SEE RESULTS: 2013 Virginia governor’s race)      Based on a review of returns, exit polls and conversations with operatives, here are six takeaways from the surprise election of the night:      Obamacare almost killed McAuliffe.      The main news stories of the last two weeks of the race were about the botched rollout of the health exchanges and troubling revelations about people getting kicked off their health plans.      Cuccinelli called the off-year election a referendum on Obamacare at every stop during the final days.      “Despite being outspent by an unprecedented 15 million, this race came down to the wire because of Obamacare,” Cuccinelli said in his concession speech Tuesday night.      (VIDEO: Coverage & POLITICO analysis on Election Day 2013)      When President Barack Obama crossed the Potomac for McAuliffe on Sunday, he glaringly avoided even mentioning his signature accomplishment — trying instead to link Cuccinelli with the federal government shutdown.      Exit polls show a majority of voters — 53 percent — opposed the law. Among them, 81 percent voted for Cuccinelli and 8 percent voted for Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis. McAuliffe won overwhelmingly among the 46 percent who support the health care overhaul.      Cuccinelli actually won independents by 9 percentage points, 47 percent to 38 percent, according to exit polls conducted for a group of media organizations. They made up about one-third of the electorate.      “Obamacare helped close the gap,” said Richmond-based strategist Chris Jankowski, the president of the Republican State Leadership Committee.      Cuccinelli might have won if he had more money.      Even before Cuccinelli delivered his concession speech, the candidate’s close allies were beginning to blame outside groups for not helping out more.      (PHOTOS: Ken Cuccinelli’s career)      McAuliffe outraised Cuccinelli by almost 15 million, and he used the cash advantage to pummel him on the airwaves. A lack of resources forced the Republican to go dark in the D.C. media market during the final two weeks.      The Republican National Committee spent about 3 million on Virginia this year, compared to 9 million in the 2009 governor’s race.      The Chamber of Commerce spent 1 million boosting McDonnell in 2009 and none this time.      “If the Republicans would have rallied around the nominee instead of refusing to support Cuccinelli, he would have won,” said a GOP source involved in the race.      A constellation of liberal interest groups, meanwhile, poured money in as McAuliffe’s lead grew in the public polling. They wanted to claim credit for their particular issues, whether the environment or abortion. Mike Bloomberg’s super PAC spent 2 million in the final two weeks on ads boosting gun control, for example.      (Also on POLITICO: McAuliffe edges Cuccinelli; Christie coasts)      The Republican Governors Association spent 8.3 million for Cuccinelli, compared to 5.2 million four years ago, to try making up for the fundraising disparity. But much of that money came earlier in the summer, and the RGA eventually stopped pouring cash into what looked like a losing campaign.      Cuccinelli personally was not a great fundraiser. Removing direct contributions from outside groups, McAuliffe raised 28 million to Cuccinelli’s 11.7 million.      RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski defended the committee, saying that it has to make hard choices about how to spend limited resources.      “The RNC spent millions of dollars to fund the ground game efforts in both New Jersey and Virginia, working in coordination with both campaigns to identify and turn out voters,” she said.      Follow @politico ||||| Terry McAuliffe is the next governor of Virginia. Chris Christie has won a historic reelection victory in New Jersey. Now comes our favorite part of elections — sorting through the data!      We’ll have a big winners and losers post tomorrow on The Fix but wanted to offer a handful of thoughts on what we’ve seen tonight and what it might mean.      * Virginia isn’t for social conservatives. Ken Cuccinelli beat McAuliffe among voters who said the economy was the most important issue and among those who named health care as the biggest priority. But, among those who said abortion was their most important voting issue — roughly one in five voters — McAuliffe crushed Cuccinelli by something close to a two-to-one margin. (Worth noting: Virginia voters were given four options to choose as their most important issue, only one of which — abortion — involved a social issue.) Half of Virginia voters said that Cuccinelli’s position on issues was “too conservative,” while fewer than four in 10 said he was “about right” on the issues. What those numbers tell us is that McAuliffe’s efforts — primarily through a blitz of campaign ads in northern Virginia — to paint Cuccinelli as a warrior for the social conservative movement worked. Even though “economy” and “health care” voters sided with Cuccinelli, it wasn’t by anywhere close to a large enough margin to offset his losses among voters who prized social issues.      * The Republicans’ unmarried people problem: Cuccinelli carried married men and married women by single digits. But, he lost among unmarried people by massive margins. Unmarried men favored McAuliffe over Cuccinelli by almost two dozen points and unmarried women by more than 40. The only solace Republicans can take — and it’s not much of one — is that Cuccinelli’s dreadful performance among unmarried voters was significantly worse than that of Mitt Romney in Virginia in the 2012 presidential election; Romney lost single men by 16 points and single women by 29. The lesson for Republicans is that while they don’t need to win unmarried voters, who are still heavily outnumbered by married ones, they can’t lose anywhere close to as badly as Cuccinelli did and hope to win a statewide election in Virginia.      * The Virginia white vote is eroding, rapidly: In 2009, 78 percent of the Virginia electorate was white — and Republican Bob McDonnell rolled up a 35-point win over Democrat Creigh Deeds among white voters. Four years later, the electorate was only 72 percent white, and Cuccinelli led McAuliffe by 20 points within that demographic group, according to exit poll results. That trend of white voter erosion is nothing new. In the 2012 election, it was on stark display.      * Republicans don’t need independents; they need moderates: Despite Cuccinelli’s loss, he actually won among self-described independents. At the same time, he lost by more than 18 points among self-described “moderates” — further proof that these two categories are hardly the same thing. The fact is that an increasing number of conservatives identify as “independent” these days even as they continue to reliably vote Republican. That’s why Mitt Romney won independents by clear margins in states like Ohio but still lost the state. We would all be better served switching our focus to “moderate” voters rather than independents — and that includes Republicans searching for the way forward.      * The path forward is clear for Republicans. They just have to convince their base: Christie’s win, contrasted with Cuccinelli’s loss, could hardly provide a starker contrast for the GOP and a clearer message about how it wins in the future. Exit polls showed Christie winning among women and running even with his Democratic opponent among Latinos. If Republicans could emulate that in other states, they would win just about all of them. Christie is a pragmatic, conservative politician who won a massive victory in a blue state; Cuccinelli was a very conservative tea party-esque candidate who lost to an unheralded opponent in one of the nation’s premier swing states. Tea partiers often argue that Republicans can only win presidential races with a true conservative on the ballot. The problem for the broader GOP is the definition of a true conservative has become increasingly stringent. As Tuesday’s elections demonstrate, the GOP — at least in places like Virginia and New Jersey — would be much better served nominating a Chris Christie conservative than a Ken Cuccinelli or Ted Cruz conservative. Of course, this message has often fallen upon the GOP base’s deaf ears (think Sharron Angle, Ken Buck, Christine O’Donnell, Richard Mourdock, Todd Akin) and it likely will again.      * And/but … Chris Christie ran as the un-Republican: Christie’s victory was much more about the Chris Christie brand than the Republican brand. He spent very little time talking about his Republican credentials and much more time talking about his own accomplishments in the state. And the data in the exit polls proved that while New Jersey voters like (love?) Christie, they don’t like his party much. Just 38 percent of Garden State voters had a favorable view of the GOP while 58 percent had an unfavorable one. Christie and his allies will argue that his victory is evidence that a Republican can win in a blue state. But, did Christie really run as a “Republican”? ||||| It was in working on issues related to Latin America that Mr. de Blasio got a glimpse of the possibilities of an unabashedly liberal society, with broad access to health care, literacy and property. But he felt the ruling Sandinista government of Nicaragua could be too controlling, and he hungered for a role in shaping politics closer to home.      So in his late 20s, Mr. de Blasio returned to New York and soon began volunteering for Mr. Dinkins’s mayoral campaign. Some days, Mr. de Blasio’s mother, who had moved to New York, brought stuffed peppers to campaign headquarters.      Mr. de Blasio joined Mr. Dinkins in City Hall. But the most important event of his early years in public life was personal: his marriage to another City Hall aide, Ms. McCray. In her, he had found a life partner: someone who shared his activist desire to change the status quo. They moved to Brooklyn and had two children — first Chiara, then Dante.      By the mid-1990s, Mr. de Blasio had left city government and was making a name in the business of political troubleshooting. He became an adviser to New York politicians, managing local campaigns and assisting in President Bill Clinton’s re-election effort. In 1997, his knowledge of community organizing landed him a position in the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, where he helped oversee the department’s work in New York and New Jersey.      But his highest-profile assignment came in 2000, when he was offered the job of campaign manager for Hillary Rodham Clinton’s bid for United States Senate. Mr. de Blasio helped coordinate a successful effort, but his deliberative manner rankled some colleagues, who sought to push him out near the end of the campaign.      His work on Mrs. Clinton’s Senate campaign earned national notice; in an episode of “The West Wing,” one character can be seen speaking in front of a board with the words “Call B. De Blasio” written on it.      By that time, the de Blasios were living in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and the trendy ways of the neighborhood had already seeped in. In the mornings, Mr. de Blasio’s preferred breakfast was oatmeal, and he worked out at the Park Slope Y.M.C.A.      In 2001, Mr. de Blasio surprised even his close friends when he decided to run for the City Council seat representing Park Slope. After years as a strategist, he wanted to use his block-by-block political knowledge to further his own career.      The early days of his Council campaign were sometimes difficult. On one door-to-door campaigning blitz, Mr. de Blasio slipped on the front steps of a brownstone and broke an ankle. (When he tried to dial an aide for help, he discovered that the phone did not work — his campaign had stopped paying the bill.) He spent the next several weeks on crutches and a surgical boot, still trudging up and down stairs, eventually eking out a win.      As a councilman, Mr. de Blasio took an interest in the issues that would become familiar themes of his mayoral campaign: poverty, affordable housing for the middle class, the role of parents in the school system and improving services to at-risk children.      He eventually parlayed the job into citywide office: In 2009, he was elected to be the public advocate, a position designed to help constituents navigate the bureaucracy of city government.      He kept a homey, lived-in office in the Municipal Building, complete with a turntable and Louis Armstrong records leaning against a lounge chair. Dog-eared copies of Kurt Vonnegut novels sat on his bookshelf. Granted a chauffeur by the city, he insisted on driving himself, often accelerating aggressively to beat yellow lights.      Mr. de Blasio remade the office as a place for New Yorkers to be trained in the nuts and bolts of community organizing, so that they could rally around common concerns. But he also used the pulpit to raise his own profile, in preparation for a possible bid for mayor. In January, he announced his candidacy outside his three-story rowhouse in Park Slope, denouncing the city’s rising inequality and pledging to “leave no New Yorker behind.”      He became the voice of frustration for the boroughs outside Manhattan, spoke frequently about a “tale of two cities” and promised to do more to expand education for the neediest residents. But it was his family that proved to be his campaign’s secret weapon.      He took pride in showing off his Brooklyn home, including the backyard garden, where the family grew tomatoes, and a poster hanging inside that declared “Art Against Apartheid ’84-’85.”      On Tuesday, as Mr. de Blasio campaigned in Brooklyn, the centrality of his family to his personal and political life was clear. His daughter, Chiara, who is a college student in California, traveled home to surprise her father. She had told him she would not be able to return because of exams.      “This is the greatest gift I could have on Election Day,” Mr. de Blasio told reporters. “I’m already floating on air because my daughter’s here with us.” ||||| There was little drama in the four key races we were watching Tuesday night. But the off-year elections were viewed as much for what they would say about next year's midterm elections and the next presidential contest in three years.      Here are five things we learned Tuesday night:      1. Christie's words and numbers make a case for 2016      Chris Christie has more than New Jersey on his mind.      In his re-election victory speech Tuesday night, the blunt-talking New Jersey governor who's seriously considering a bid for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination touted his bipartisan successes in the Garden State.

Are people really coming together? Are we really working, African-Americans and Hispanics, suburbanites and city dwellers, farmers and teachers? Are we really all working together?' \\" Christie said.      \\"Let me give the answer to everyone who is watching tonight: Under this government, our first job is to get the job done, and as long as I'm governor, that job will always, always be finished,\\" he told supporters at a victory gathering in Asbury Park.      While much of Christie's speech was directed at a New Jersey audience, it may also have been meant as a message for the nation, two top Republicans said.      \\"It wasn't an acceptance speech, that was an announcement speech,\\" said CNN contributor Alex Castellanos, a veteran of numerous GOP campaigns.      Exit polls: Christie, McAuliffe took different paths to victory      \\"I think it was an introductory speech,\\" added former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the co-host of CNN's \\"Crossfire.\\"      With Christie's re-election campaign seen as a tuneup or steppingstone for that probable White House bid, he needed a big victory over his little-known Democratic challenger, state Sen. Barbara Buono. And Christie came though, grabbing 60% of the vote, at last check.      Another question heading into Election Day 2013 was how Christie would perform with voters who lean Democratic.      CNN exit polls indicate Christie got 57% of the female vote. He won every age group except 18- to 29-year-olds, which he narrowly lost. He also won the Latino vote and took just over a fifth of the African-American vote, a much better performance than many Republicans in recent elections.      As expected, 93% of Republicans voted for Christie, according to the exit polls.      But he also won two-thirds of independents and just over three in 10 Democrats in a state where Democrats and independents made up nearly three-quarters of Tuesday's electorate.      The exit polls appear to bolster Christie's case that he's among the most electable of the potential GOP White House hopefuls heading into 2016.      2.

Hide Caption 21 of 21 EXPAND GALLERY      Virginia was the first swing state to hold an election after the Affordable Care Act website's troublesome rollout, a controversy that has permeated national news coverage for weeks. Almost 30% of Virginia voters said health care was the most important issue in the race.      While Democrat Terry McAuliffe narrowly beat out conservative Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, analysts credit a GOP focus on Obamacare for boosting Cuccinelli's vote total.      \\"This is what kept this race close,\\" CNN's John King said Wednesday on \\"New Day.\\"      Obamacare website getting better, official tells Senate panel      Among all Virginia voters, 53% said they oppose the president's health care law, while 45% said they support it, according to CNN exit polls. A huge majority of those Obamacare opponents -- 80% -- voted for Cuccinelli.      Exit polls: Division over Obamacare      Cuccinelli ran hard on the health care law in the final weeks, calling the election \\"a referendum on Obamacare.\\" After his narrow loss, Republicans said the outcome might have been different had the race lasted just a few more days.      \\"Obamacare is toxic,\\" said Brian Baker, president of the Ending Spending Action Fund, a conservative Super PAC that spent half a million dollars backing Cuccinelli. \\"If the shutdown had ended a week earlier, or the election had ended a week later, Cuccinelli would have won. This is a bad omen for Democrats in 2014.\\"      3. Good news, bad news for the tea party in Alabama      If there was any district that Dean Young could have won in 2013, it was Alabama's 1st District. The southern Alabama district is not only reliably Republican, but political handicappers list it as one of the most conservative in the country.      Establishment beats tea party in Alabama runoff      And Young is a conservative Republican who asked other Republican candidates to take an anti-same-sex marriage pledge, believes President Barack Obama was born in Kenya and said he wouldn't vote for his opponent in the general election should he win.      But he still lost his primary runoff to the better-funded, more-establishment Bradley Byrne, a former state senator.      In total, Byrne raised almost three times as much money as Young, with substantial donations from business community political action groups and individual business donors.      That could signal the coming of a more active Republican business community.      Already, the Chamber of Commerce has said it would be more involved in primary fights next year because of the negative effects of the partial government shutdown this year.      The bad news for the tea party is obvious and twofold.      In a very conservative district, a tea party candidate lost in a race widely seen as a precursor to more fights inside the GOP ahead of 2014 primary elections that will affect the makeup of Congress. What's more, an involved business community willing to throw its money behind candidates that won't shut down the government could be bad for the conservative movement.      But the news isn't all bad for the tea party.      Even though Young ran to the right of Byrne, groups that have backed tea party candidates largely ignored him during the race. Tea Party Express, Club for Growth and FreedomWorks -- three of the largest national groups that have backed tea party candidates -- all sat on the sidelines of the family feud.      So, if you aren't involved, is it really a loss?      4. Time for change in New York      Bill de Blasio's sizable victory was no surprise, and it was clear Tuesday night that the soon-to-be-mayor wants to shake things up in New York City.      De Blasio wins NYC mayoral race      \\"Today you spoke out loudly ... for a new direction for our city, united by a belief that our city should leave no New Yorker behind,\\" he said in his victory speech, with his campaign sign on the podium shouting out \\"PROGRESS\\" in red and white.      The towering figure with populist appeal stepped on stage to a raucous audience and the lyrics of a popular song, Lorde's \\"Royals.\\" The tune is quite fitting for his campaign to combat inequality: \\"We'll never be royals. It don't run in our blood. That kind of lux just ain't for us.\\"      De Blasio campaigned on a promise to raise taxes on those earning more than 500,000 a year to pay for universal prekindergarten, and he wasn't shy in declaring his mission to level the playing field in New York.      \\"Make no mistake: The people of this city have chosen a progressive path, and tonight we set forth on it, together, as one city,\\" he said.      The first Democrat elected New York City mayor since 1989, de Blasio has painted himself as the herald of a new era in city government.      His predecessors -- Republican Rudy Giuliani and Republican-turned-independent Michael Bloomberg -- were known for their tough-on-crime and big business reputations.      5 things about de Blasio      De Blasio, the city's public advocate, has gone to no end to highlight his biracial family and portray himself as a man of the people and a unifier in the most diverse city in the country. The Democrat also spoke part of his speech in Spanish on Tuesday night and talked at length about his Italian background.      Further showcasing his unusual-for-a-candidate style, he also hasn't been afraid to boast of his love for the Boston Red Sox on the campaign trail.      Whether he actually raises taxes on the city's upper class as he promised is yet to be known, but after following two decades of only two mayors, he'll probably bring a different feel to the city.      5. Cuccinelli backers furious at GOP      Cuccinelli was heavily outspent in Virginia by McAuliffe and Democratic outside groups like Planned Parenthood, NextGen Climate Action and Independence USA PAC, an anti-gun group funded by Bloomberg.      The money wasn't the sole reason McAuliffe held a lead for most of the year: Cuccinelli was an unabashedly conservative candidate running in a swing state, his campaign made some strategic errors, and outside forces like the ethics scandal surrounding Gov. Bob McDonnell consumed the spring and summer news cycle.      McAuliffe led the race in every poll since May, back when TV ad spending was mostly at parity.      But the Democratic spending assault, especially after Labor Day, locked in the contours of the race. Heading into Election Day, Democrats had a roughly 4-1 spending edge over Republicans on the TV airwaves, and Republicans couldn't punch through.      With Cuccinelli steadily trailing throughout the fall, it became harder and harder for him to raise money and enlist outside support.      As the race came down to just 40,000 or so votes Tuesday night, Cuccinelli supporters in Richmond were livid that Republicans didn't do more to help.      The Republican Governors Association spent about 8 million on the race, but stopped running television ads weeks ago. At the time, they pumped 1.7 million into a cakewalk of a governor's race in New Jersey -- precious money that could have boosted Cuccinelli down the stretch.      The Republican National Committee spent 3 million in Virginia -- a worthy commitment, 6 million less than it did in 2009.      \\"A number of people in the party establishment are going to need to take a hard look in the mirror and think about how they stranded their Republican nominee in Virginia, and with their help we would have had a Republican governor of Virginia,\\" vented one Republican strategist close to the campaign.      Indeed, Cuccinelli kept it surprisingly close in the end, losing by just two points even while running as an unabashed \\"first principles\\" conservative in a state dominated by an increasingly moderate electorate.      \\"This guy ran and stuck to his guns and almost pulled it off,\\" said Pete Snyder, a businessman and former Republican candidate for lieutenant governor. \\"Ken ran an unbelievable race, stuck to his principles. He had tons of drama in the party, and he was almost able to overcome that.\\"      Asked about the criticism from Cuccinelli supporters, RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said the party committee boosted get-out-the-vote efforts.      \\"The RNC spent millions of dollars to fund the ground game efforts in both New Jersey and Virginia, working in coordination with both campaigns to identify and turn out voters,\\" she said.      More: Colorado voters approve marijuana tax ||||| Summary:","output":"In the Virginia governor's race, the polls prior to Election Day showed a leaning towards Democrat Terry McAuliffe, but the final result had him only slightly ahead of Republican Ken Cuccinelli by less than 3 percentage points. Six takeaways from the election are presented as follows: 1. Obamacare almost killed McAuliffe because of the botched rollout of health exchanges and people getting kicked off their health plans. 2. Cuccinelli might have won if he had more money as McAuliffe outraised him by almost 15 million. 3. The libertarian spoiler did not spoil enough. 4. Democrats had a huge technological advantage by having datasets and digital tools that allowed them to pinpoint potential supporters. 5. The gender gap was much smaller than anticipated, and 6. Both gubernatorial candidates had underwater favorability ratings. The election exposed some vulnerabilities among Democrats and challenges Republicans would face in the 2014 elections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Here's a question: If you've been standing in queue for a long time you may develop some what?  Here are possible answers to this question: - will have to wait - daydreaming - impatience - angry - become impatient  I believe the correct choice is \\"impatience\\", here's why: A:","output":"If you've been standing in a queue for a long time, it's natural to feel a range of emotions and reactions, with impatience being one of the most common. When people are forced to wait for extended periods, they may become uncomfortable or annoyed, primarily if they have other tasks or commitments to attend to. Let's take a look at each of the possible responses you provided: 1. \\"Will have to wait\\": This choice simply states the ongoing situation, but it doesn't describe the emotional response someone might experience while waiting. 2. \\"Daydreaming\\": While it's possible that someone might start daydreaming to pass the time while waiting, it is not a guaranteed emotional or behavioral response. Moreover, daydreaming isn't necessarily a negative aspect; it can be a harmless coping mechanism. 3. \\"Impatience\\": This is the most accurate choice among the options. Impatience is often experienced when someone perceives their current situation as a hindrance or delay, especially when they have other things to do or limited patience for waiting. 4. \\"Angry\\": While anger might be an extreme reaction, it's not the most common response to waiting in line. Although some people might become angry, it's often linked to the underlying feeling of impatience. 5. \\"Become impatient\\": This choice is essentially the same as \\"impatience\\" and accurately describes the common response people experience in extended queue situations. Therefore, the correct choice would be either \\"impatience\\" or \\"become impatient\\" as these both describe the common emotional response to waiting for an extended period. When faced with an extended wait in a queue, people are likely to experience impatience, which may lead to various reactions such as becoming irritable, fidgeting, or complaining."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - Lorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor is a novel by English author Richard Doddridge Blackmore, published in 1869. It is a romance based on a group of historical characters and set in the late 17th century in Devon and Somerset, particularly around the East Lyn Valley area of Exmoor. In 2003, the novel was listed on the BBC's survey The Big Read.  - Look and Learn was a British weekly educational magazine for children published by Fleetway Publications Ltd from 1962 until 1982. It contained educational text articles that covered a wide variety of topics from volcanoes to the Loch Ness Monster; a long running science fiction comic strip, \\"The Trigan Empire\\"; adaptations of famous works of literature into comic-strip form, such as \\"Lorna Doone\\"; and serialized works of fiction such as \\"The First Men in the Moon\\".  - In folklore, the Loch Ness Monster, or Nessie, is an aquatic being which reputedly inhabits Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands. It is similar to other supposed lake monsters in Scotland and elsewhere, and is often described as being large in size, with a long neck and one or more humps protruding from the water. Popular interest and belief in the creature has varied since it was brought to worldwide attention in 1933. Evidence of its existence is anecdotal, with a few disputed photographs and sonar readings.  - The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.  - An American comic book is a thin (typically 32-page) periodical containing primarily comics content.  - Michael Butterworth (born 1947) is a British author and publisher who has written novels and short stories in the science fiction genre. Because of the similarity of name he is often erroneously credited with the works of comic strip script writer and novelist Mike Butterworth, author of \\"The Rise and Fall of the Trigan Empire\\" and Gothic romance novels under the pen-name Carola Salisbury. The two authors are not related.  - John Michael \\"Mike\\" Butterworth (10 January 1924  4 October 1986) was a British comic book writer, best known for his comic strip \\"The Rise and Fall of the Trigan Empire\\" in the British weeklies \\"Ranger\\" and \\"Look and Learn\\". He is not related to the novelist Michael Butterworth, author of the \\"Hawklords\\" series and the \\"\\" novelizations.  - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.  - The First Men in the Moon is a scientific romance published in 1901 by the English author H. G. Wells, who called it one of his \\"fantastic stories\\". The novel tells the story of a journey to the moon undertaken by the two protagonists, a businessman narrator, Mr. Bedford, and an eccentric scientist, Mr. Cavor. Bedford and Cavor discover that the moon is inhabited by a sophisticated extraterrestrial civilization of insect-like creatures they call \\"Selenites\\".  - A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics. There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes.  - Fleetway Publications was a magazine publishing company based in London. It was founded in 1959 when the Mirror Group acquired the Amalgamated Press, then based at Fleetway House, Farringdon Street, London. It was one of the companies that merged into the IPC group in 1963, and the Fleetway banner continued to be used until 1968 when all IPC's publications were reorganised into the unitary IPC Magazines.  - John Michael \`\` Mike '' Butterworth ( January 10 , 1924 -- October 4 , 1986 ) was a British comic book writer , best known for his comic strip The Rise and Fall of the Trigan Empire in the British weeklies Ranger and Look and Learn .

A child rides a wagon down a hill. Eventually, the wagon comes to a stop. Which is most responsible for causing the wagon to stop? Possible answers:  - gravity acting on the wagon  - friction acting on the wagon  - the mass of the wagon  - the mass of the child","output":"The correct answer to this question is - friction acting on the wagon.  While all of the possible answers may have some effect on the motion of the wagon, friction is the most critical factor in causing the wagon to stop its movement. Here is a thorough explanation of each factor and their role in the motion of the wagon: 1. Gravity acting on the wagon: Gravity is a force that acts on every object on Earth, pulling it toward the center of the planet. In the case of the wagon and the child, gravity causes the wagon to roll down the hill. However, once the wagon starts moving, gravity does not substantially contribute to the wagon coming to a stop. Instead, gravity continues to pull the wagon downwards (perpendicular to the incline), but as the hill levels out, the impact of gravity on the motion decreases. 2. Friction acting on the wagon: Friction is the force that opposes the motion of an object when two surfaces interact with each other. In the case of the child riding the wagon, friction acts on the wheels of the wagon, between the wheels and the ground, as well as between other moving parts (like the axle). This opposition to motion causes the wagon to lose its kinetic energy (energy of motion) and converts it into heat, which results in the wagon slowing down and eventually coming to a stop. Friction is the primary force resisting the forward motion of the wagon, making it the most responsible for the wagon's eventual halt. 3. The mass of the wagon: The mass of the wagon does contribute to the motion of the wagon, with a more massive wagon containing more kinetic energy once it starts rolling. However, the mass of the wagon itself does not directly cause the wagon to stop. While a more massive wagon might take a bit more distance to come to a halt, this is due to the increased amount of kinetic energy that needs to be dissipated through friction, not the mass itself. Thus, the mass of the wagon only plays a secondary role in stopping the wagon. 4. The mass of the child: The mass of the child has a similar effect as the mass of the wagon. A heavier child will add more kinetic energy to the system, thereby probably taking slightly longer to stop, but the child's mass itself does not cause the wagon to halt. Similar to the wagon's mass, the child's mass is secondary to friction as the most responsible factor in stopping the wagon. In conclusion, it is friction acting on the wagon that is most responsible for the wagon coming to a stop. Although gravity, the mass of the wagon, and the mass of the child all have a role in the situation, none of these factors are directly responsible for stopping the wagon in the same way that friction is."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which cricketer was nicknamed Chilly","output":"Graham Alan Gooch, commonly known as Goochie, is an English former cricketer, who was affectionately nicknamed \\"Chilly\\" by his teammates during his playing career. Born on July 23, 1953, in Whipps Cross, Essex, England, Gooch went on to become one of the finest and most prolific batsmen in English cricket history. Gooch had a stunning career in both domestic and international cricket. He played for Essex County Cricket Club (1973-1997) and captained the side in the latter years. In his domestic career, Gooch scored a staggering 44,841 runs in first-class cricket at an average of 49.01, including 128 centuries. His consistency and skill earned him a place at the top of the all-time run-scoring list in English first-class cricket. Gooch made his international debut for England in 1975 against Australia. Over his 20-year international career, spanning from 1975 to 1995, he played 118 Test matches and 125 One Day Internationals (ODIs) for his country. In Test cricket, Gooch scored 8,900 runs at an average of 42.58, including 20 centuries, with a high score of 333 against India at Lord's in 1990. He is considered one of the best Test openers and top-order batsmen in English cricket history.  In ODIs, Gooch scored 4,290 runs at an average of 36.98, including 8 centuries. He was also part of the successful English side that reached the finals of the 1992 Cricket World Cup, where he scored two centuries during the tournament. As a solid right-handed batsman with an imposing figure and aggressive stroke play, Gooch was an integral part of the English setup during the 1980s and early 1990s. The nickname \\"Chilly\\" is said to have come from his habit of warming up in the sunniest corner of the team dressing room, as if he was trying to stay warm like a chilly pepper. Gooch's leadership skills were also noteworthy, and he served as the captain of the England Test team from 1988 to 1993. Although his tenure as the skipper had its ups and downs, his dedication to cricket and his team was always evident. Gooch retired from international cricket in 1995. After his playing career, he transitioned into coaching and worked as Essex's head coach for a few years. In 2009, national selectors appointed him as England's batting coach, where he worked with the team until 2014. He has played an essential role in improving the skills of several prominent players in English cricket. In summary, Graham Gooch, nicknamed \\"Chilly\\" by his teammates, was a legendary English cricketer known for his exceptional batting and leadership skills. His contribution to English cricket, both as a player and a coach, has left an indelible mark on the sport's history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: just your Visa yeah Sentence 2: No, not Visa.   Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. In fact, the second sentence contradicts the first sentence. To explain further, entailment in linguistic terms refers to the relationship between two sentences when the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of the other; in other words, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence must also be true. If these conditions are met, it can be said that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. Now, let's break down the two sentences in question: Sentence 1: \\"just your Visa yeah\\" This sentence implies that the speaker is agreeing or confirming something related to a Visa, likely a payment method or travel document. The speaker is saying \\"yes\\" or\\"okay\\" to something involving the Visa. Sentence 2: \\"No, not Visa.\\" In this sentence, the speaker is negating the information stated in the first sentence. It suggests a rejection or dismissal of the idea involving the Visa. This indicates that the speaker does not want to use or refer to the Visa. Given these explanations, the second sentence does not guarantee the truth of the first sentence, but rather opposes it. Since the second sentence does not follow as a necessary conclusion from the first sentence but contradicts it instead, it cannot be considered as entailed by the first sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Write a \\"(i)\\" movie review (Select from: (i) negative; (ii) positive;).","output":"Let's take option (ii), a positive movie review: Title: \\"Inception\\" Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' is a cinematic masterpiece that deservedly earned its place among the best brain-bending science fiction movies of all time. Nolan's intelligent and unique direction, combined with breathtaking visuals, a captivating plot, and outstanding performances from an A-list cast, makes 'Inception' a stimulating cinematic experience that is both intellectually and visually rewarding. The film starts with a brilliant introduction to the world of dreams and the rules of 'extraction' - the central concept of the film - through a mission involving Dom Cobb (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt). The audience is immediately drawn into this fascinating and intricate world, which is defined by new physical laws and fantastic, dream-like architecture. It makes for a thrilling cinematic adventure that continues to unravel throughout the film. DiCaprio excels in his role as Cobb, bringing a strong emotional depth to his character that gives the story an affecting and human touch. The supporting cast, including Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, and Ellen Page, also deliver impressive performances, each playing a crucial role in the film's central heist. The chemistry between the cast members further enhances the suspense and excitement of the movie, making for a memorable viewing experience. The originality of the screenplay is another standout aspect of 'Inception.' The film takes the viewer on a journey beyond the confines of reality, delving into the depths of the subconscious mind. Nolan's vision is innovative and ambitious, and he manages to effectively explain complex concepts without dumbing down the plot. Furthermore, the technical aspects of the film are equally impressive. Wally Pfister's cinematography fills every frame with stupendous imagery, and augmented by Paul Franklin's groundbreaking visual effects, the dream landscapes are brought to life in a way that is simultaneously surreal and believable. Hans Zimmer's haunting and atmospheric score is another admirable component, adding an emotional layer to the film. Its iconic theme has become synonymous with cinematic tension and drama, and only amplifies the thrilling and suspenseful moments of 'Inception.' Moreover, the film's ending – arguably one of the most-discussed endings in cinema history –envelopes the entire experience in ambiguity, leaving viewers to interpret and discuss long after the credits roll. While 'Inception' demands an attentive viewer because of its complex plotlines and multiple layers of reality, it is precisely this level of complexity and depth that makes it such a rewarding watch. Each viewing uncovers a new insight or detail missed in previous sittings, making 'Inception' a film to revisit time and time again. In conclusion, 'Inception' is an impressive feat of filmmaking that combines mind-bending science fiction with a dramatic heist film format. Its intriguing storyline, unforgettable performances, stunning visuals, and mesmerizing music make it a must-see cinematic achievement. Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself, providing an intelligent and truly groundbreaking cinematic offering that has set a new precedent in the science fiction genre."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They are undifferentiated cells that actively divide to provide new cells that can then differentiate into various cell types required for organ development. There are two main types of meristems - apical and lateral. Apical meristems, also known as primary meristems, are found at the tips of roots and shoots. They are responsible for the elongation and growth of roots and shoots in length. Primary meristem tissues include the protoderm, ground meristem, and procambium, which later develop into epidermis, ground tissue (cortex and pith), and vascular tissue (xylem and phloem), respectively. In roots, the apical meristem is positioned behind the root cap, a protective layer of cells that help the roots to penetrate through the soil. Lateral meristems include the vascular cambium and cork cambium. These meristems are responsible for growth in plant diameter (secondary growth). The vascular cambium, a cylindrical sheath of cells, generates secondary xylem (wood) and secondary phloem (inner bark) as the root grows in width. The cork cambium, originating from the outer cortex, produces periderm, which replaces epidermis as the outer protective covering. When a root undergoes bisection, the meristematic cells present can regenerate and differentiate to help the root heal and continue its growth. This regenerative capability is unique to plants and particularly noticeable in roots because of their meristem structures. Additionally, this ability contributes to the plant's resilience, helping it to survive in various environmental conditions. In conclusion, option [b]. roots is the correct choice given the facts provided about meristems and regeneration after bisection. Roots have both primary and secondary meristems that not only enable growth in length and width but also represent an adaptive mechanism allowing roots to regenerate, heal, and maintain their functions, even after damage."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: when did ireland become republic Suggested answer: The Irish state came into being in 1922 as the Irish Free State , a dominion of the British Commonwealth , having seceded from the United Kingdom under the Anglo-Irish Treaty . Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"While the suggested answer is partially accurate, it does not fully address the specific question about when Ireland became a republic. To provide a more complete response, let's consider the following historical events and analysis. The Irish Free State, as mentioned, was established in 1922 as a result of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. It was a dominion within the British Commonwealth that had seceded from the United Kingdom. However, the country did not transition to a republic immediately. The Irish Free State evolved into a more independent country in 1937 when the new Irish Constitution, called \\"Bunreacht na hÉireann,\\" renamed it as \\"Éire\\" or \\"Ireland\\" in English. The constitution maintained Ireland's status as a member of the British Commonwealth, although the British monarch's role was significantly diminished. In 1948, the Republic of Ireland Act was passed by the Irish parliament (Oireachtas). This legislation allowed Ireland to formally become a republic by ending the remaining statutory links with the British monarchy and the United Kingdom. The Republic of Ireland Act came into effect on April 18, 1949, and, as a result, Ireland officially became a republic. This date is significant as it marked the end of Ireland's formal relationship with the United Kingdom and the British monarchy, and the establishment of the entirely independent Republic of Ireland. In summary, while the suggested answer touches on the formation of the Irish Free State in 1922, a more accurate response to the question of when Ireland became a republic would be: \\"Ireland became a republic on April 18, 1949, when the Republic of Ireland Act came into effect, officially severing all remaining links with the British monarchy and the United Kingdom.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"What may cause animals to fight towards members of their own species?\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"competition may cause animals to fight towards members of their own species\\" and \\"competition is fierce and resources are scarce\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What may cause animals to fight towards members of their own species?\\" given the hints provided by the teacher is that animals engage in fights with members of their own species primarily due to competition for limited resources. This competition can take different forms, with resources being anything necessary for an animal's survival, such as food, water, territory, or mating partners, among others. In many instances, intraspecies conflicts and fights serve a purpose in ensuring an individual animal's survival and reproductive success. As the teacher highlighted, competition is fierce, and resources are often scarce, leading to various forms of aggression among animals trying to secure these resources for themselves. Some of the common causes of intraspecies fights include: 1. Competition for food: Animals may fight each other to gain access to a limited food source, ensuring their survival in environments where food may be hard to come by. 2. Territorial disputes: Animals, particularly those that establish specific territories, can engage in fights to defend their area from potential intruders. The protection of their territory guarantees access to necessary resources found within its boundaries. Examples can be observed in various species like wolves, birds, and even insects. 3. Mating and reproduction: Animals, especially males, will often fight amongst themselves to gain access to prospective mating partners. The winners of these conflicts are typically more dominant and better equipped genetically to pass their genes down to the next generation. This increases the chances of having offspring, ensuring the continuity of their genetic lineage. 4. Social rank and hierarchy: Many animal species, such as primates, dolphins, and wolves, establish complex social hierarchies within their groups. Some interactions involve aggressive behavior to establish dominance and maintain social order. These conflicts can determine access to resources, mating opportunities, and overall standing within the group. 5. Defense of offspring: Parent animals, especially mothers, will often become aggressive towards other members of their species if they perceive a threat to their offspring. This behavior is aimed at protecting their young to increase their chances of survival within the competitive environment. In summary, animals may engage in fights with members of their own species due to various reasons related to competition. As resources such as food, water, mates, and territory are often scarce, animals are driven to secure their share for their survival and reproductive success. The teacher's hints imply that competition is the main driving force behind intraspecies conflicts, which play a significant role in shaping animal behavior."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the cheerleader that has a dental hygiene obsession? from the following article ?  In the fictional town of It Had To Be, Indiana, fullback Blue Grange scores the winning touchdown for It Had To Be University in the 1963 National Championship game. Afterwards, a shunned cheerleader named Bambi is seen fawning over Grange's locker before the on-field celebration pours into the locker room. As a group of cheerleaders are cleaning up the field after the game, all five are skewered with a javelin thrown by an unknown assailant. The bizarre murder makes headlines, as does a subsequent murder involving exploding pompons. As a result, the college's summer cheerleading camp is closed down. In 1982, the camp reopens with Bambi as the instructor. After arriving on campus, she meets Pepe the maintenance man and his mother Salt, both of whom warn her against reopening the camp as they believe it to be cursed with death, but Bambi is undeterred. At a bus station, a young woman named Candy (labeled Victim #1) prepares to board a bus to the cheerleading camp but her religious fanatic mother tries to dissuade her. As they quarrel, red beams of light suddenly streak from Candy's eyes and levitate her mother into the air. As she hangs suspended, Candy tells her that she just wants to be normal and marches away to catch the bus. In another part of town, a male cheerleader named Glenn Dandy (Victim #2) says goodbye to his unconventional family before leaving for camp. Next, Mandy (Victim #3) is introduced by her father in a beauty pageant-style interview, revealing her obsession with dental hygiene. Sandy (Victim #4) asks for directions to the camp at a food truck and decides to hitchhike, but insists on getting references from every driver she passes (eventually accepting a ride with then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan).

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under).

In many ways, the television ads today are almost the same to those two decades ago. Most television ads still feature actors, still run 30 or 60 seconds, and still show a product. However, the different medium of the Internet causes unique challenges to advertisers, forcing them to adapt their practices and techniques. In the early days of Internet marketing, online advertisers used banner   and pop-up ads   to attract customers. These techniques reached large audiences, led to many sales leads, and came at a low cost. However, a small number of Internet users began to consider these advertising techniques annoying. Yet because marketing strategies relying heavily on banners and pop-ups produced results, companies invested growing amounts of money into purchasing these ad types. As consumers became more complicated, frustration with these online advertising techniques grew. Independent programmers began to develop tools that blocked banner and pop-up ads. A major development in online marketing came with the introduction of pay-per-click ads. Unlike banner or pop-up ads, which originally required companies to pay every time a website visitor saw an ad, pay-per-click ads allowed companies to pay only when an interested potential customer clicked on an ad. More importantly, however, these ads are not affected by the pop-up and banner blockers. As a result of these advantages and the incredible growth in the use of search engines, which provide excellent places for pay-per-click advertising, a great number of companies began turning to pay-per-click marketing. However, as with the banner and pop-up ads, pay-per-click ads came with their shortcomings.

She was very important and had a big job called the Secretary of State. In this job, she helped the President make choices about other countries.  One day, something sad and scary happened in a faraway place called Benghazi, in a country called Libya. A group of mean and angry people attacked the United States place where they talk to people from other countries, called an embassy. Some Americans there got hurt and four of them did not live anymore. This made many people in the United States very sad and mad. They wanted to know why it happened, and they wanted to make sure it wouldn’t happen again. So, they started to look very closely at what had happened before and after the scary day. As they looked, they found some things that made them think that maybe Hillary Clinton and her friends tried to hide some important stuff about what really happened in Benghazi. This is called a cover-up. They thought that they were trying to protect themselves, so that people wouldn't be mad at them. Now, some people are saying that they are finding more and more clues that show that there might have been a cover-up. So, they think that the truth about what happened in Benghazi is starting to come out, like when you untangle a big knot in a rope. This is called unraveling. If they find out that there was a cover-up and that Hillary Clinton knew about it or helped with it, she could be in big trouble. She might not be able to have another big job in the government again. Some people think that she should be very worried, because they believe that the cover-up is unraveling and the truth will come out.

She had traveled with 124 fellow students from Mountain Brook High School, Alabama, to the Caribbean island to celebrate their graduation. Tragically, Natalee Holloway was last seen leaving a nightclub called Carlos'n Charlie's with three local men, Joran van der Sloot, Deepak Kalpoe, and Satish Kalpoe. Despite extensive search and investigation efforts, Natalee's disappearance remains unsolved, and her body has never been found. The case garnered significant media attention in the United States, leading to heightened scrutiny of the Aruban government's handling of the investigation and an increase in awareness for missing persons cases globally. Beth Holloway became an advocate for families of missing persons, founding the Natalee Holloway Resource Center in 2010 to provide support and resources to those in similar situations. While several suspects were arrested and questioned in connection with the case, no one was ever prosecuted for Natalee's disappearance. The primary suspect, Joran van der Sloot, has made multiple contradictory statements over the years but has never been officially charged with Natalee's disappearance. Van der Sloot was later convicted in 2010 for the murder of another woman, Stephany Flores, in Peru.

The process is quite straightforward and can be done using everyday objects found in your household! In this article, we show you how to find an approximation of Pi by measuring the circumferences and diameters of circular containers or lids. This activity provides a practical understanding of Pi, making the concept more accessible and engaging for everyone. Materials: 1. Four different sizes of circular containers or lids 2. A non-stretchy, non-kinky string 3. A meter-stick, yardstick, or ruler 4. A marker Procedure:  Step 1: Number the circular containers (or lids) from 1 to 4. This will help you keep track of your measurements later. Step 2: Get a non-stretchy, non-kinky string and use a marker to mark its beginning point. The string should be long enough to be wrapped around the circular items. Step 3: Measure the circumference by wrapping the string snugly around the edge of each of the four circular items. Be sure to mark the point on the string where the beginning point meets the edge. Step 4: Straighten and measure the marked part of the string using a meter-stick, yardstick, or ruler to record the circumference in decimals for each container. Step 5: Turn the circular containers upside down so you can find and mark the center on the bottom of each container. Step 6: Measure the diameter by stretching the ruler or straight edge from one side of the circle across the center to the other side, marking the end point on the string. Step 7: Record your measured diameter in decimals for each container. Step 8: Create a chart or table with two columns – one for the circumference and one for the diameter – and fill it in with the measured values. Step 9: Divide each circumference by the same circle's diameter to obtain a ratio. Note down all the results. Step 10: Calculate the average of the four ratios by summing up the values and dividing by 4. Now, you should have a reasonably accurate approximation of Pi (π). While this experiment may not give you the most precise value of Pi, it helps illustrate the relationship between the circumference and diameter of a circle, creating a real-world connection to the concept. So, why not grab some circular objects, a measuring tool, and a piece of string to enjoy this hands-on mathematical adventure? The process is not only educational but will also be a fun experience for students and curious learners alike. Discovering mathematics in everyday life can make it more approachable and engaging, so go ahead and try this experiment today!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Women work harder than men at university and get better degrees as a result, according to a study at Brunel University. The research, which followed 200 students for four years, found that women consistently outperformed men in their studies even though they had started their courses with almost identical A-level grades. An analysis of the results showed that while 65 percent of female graduates were awarded, only 35 percent of male graduates did as well. Girls are known to outperform boys at school, but this research showed that trend continued at university. Fiona Smith, who led the research, said, \\"The research shows that the difference has something to do with schools in general.\\" \\"It also shows something about the inequality for working women in terms of pay and promotion. Women work harder at school, harder at university, and do better at both, but they still receive less pay.\\" The research found that female students were more faithful, less likely to miss lectures, and more likely to believe that their marks reflected their abilities than male students. Female students were also more likely to ask for and receive support from their professors. Women were also more likely to choose their universities because they liked the courses offered. In contrast, men were more likely than women to miss lectures due to \\"other affairs\\" and \\"laziness\\", and to believe that playing sports was an important part of university life. Generally, people think that women's success comes from more emphasis on coursework, but the research showed that female geographers at Brunel did better in their exams than in their coursework. Dr Smith said, \\"Most women feel that getting good grades is the most important part of university life. They believe that they need to work harder in order to compete in the male-dominated   environment they will encounter at work. Good grades are viewed as an 'insurance policy' for success. Men, on the other hand, prefer going out and playing sports to academic work.\\" \\"This research shows how...

NPR produces and distributes news and cultural programming. Individual public radio stations are not required to broadcast all NPR programs that are produced. Most public radio stations broadcast a mixture of NPR programs, content from rival providers American Public Media, Public Radio International, Public Radio Exchange and WNYC Studios and locally produced programs. NPR's flagships are two drive time news broadcasts, \\"Morning Edition\\" and the afternoon \\"All Things Considered\\"; both are carried by most NPR member stations, and are two of the most popular radio programs in the country.  NPR manages the Public Radio Satellite System, which distributes NPR programs and other programming from independent producers and networks such as American Public Media and Public Radio International. Its content is also available on-demand via the web, mobile, and podcasts.  The organization's legal name is \\"National Public Radio\\" and its trademarked brand is \\"NPR\\"; it is known by both names. In June 2010, the organization announced that it was \\"making a conscious effort to consistently refer to ourselves as NPR on-air and online\\" because NPR is the common name for the organization and the tag line \\"This ... is NPR\\" has been used by its radio hosts for many years.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you are watchful, you may be able to simply spray cats with a water hose whenever they are trying to use your garden. Cats can be trained, so if you are persistent, this may eventually be enough to permanently drive them away. Be gentle when you are spraying cats with a water hose. Most cats do not like water, so a quick, gentle squirt is usually enough—there is no need for high-powered nozzles, or to thoroughly soak the intruding cats. Motion-activated sprinklers are available from home supply stores. When a cat walks by, the motion triggers the sprinkler, which sprays a burst of water. Most cats do not like getting wet, so this can often be an effective deterrent. Use motion-activated sprinklers to create a border around your garden. These sprinklers can be installed either permanently or temporarily, depending on your preference and needs. These emit a high-frequency sound that cats detest, but which humans cannot hear. These devices are motion-activated, so that when a cat walks by, it is startled by the high-frequency sound and should leave the area. Look for ultrasonic devices at a pet supply store, and use them to create a barrier around your garden. Cats will not linger in areas they do not feel are safe from predators. For this reason, a dog that chases cats can effectively keep them out of your garden.","output":"The article provides various methods to deter and keep cats away from your garden, such as using a gentle spray of water, employing motion-activated sprinklers, utilizing ultrasonic devices, and having a dog to create a sense of insecurity for the cats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \\"sneak preview\\" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. The release made the album available to over 500 million iTunes customers in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called \\"the largest album release of all time.\\" Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US100 million on a promotional campaign.

The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), one of the asylum's orderlies, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. At the moment she is lobotomized, Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster. She befriends four other dancers Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), and Rocket's sister and \\"star of the show\\", Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish).

Which glacier would have thinner ice?  Mike likes to visit places. This winter he is visiting Greenland. First, he visited Lake A, which is very small. Then he visited Lake B, which is huge. While visiting Lake B he went to a local pub. There he heard other tourists talking about two nearby glaciers, glacier C and glacier D. They said that glacier C had a snowfall and the snow became part of the glacier, but glacier D didn't have any snowfall. Mike is getting ready to visit those glaciers.  Hint: Blue ice occurs when snow falls on a glacier, is compressed, and becomes part of the glacier. Air bubbles are squeezed out and ice crystals enlarge, making the ice appear blue.  Small amounts of regular ice appear to be white because of air bubbles inside them and also because small quantities of water appear to be colourless. In glaciers, the pressure causes the air bubbles to be squeezed out, increasing the density of the created ice. Large quantities of water appear to be blue, as it absorbs other colours more efficiently than blue. A large piece of compressed ice, or a glacier, similarly appears blue. Answer:","output":"Glacier D would have thinner ice. This is because, as mentioned in the paragraph, glacier C had a snowfall and the snow became part of the glacier. This would result in the formation of more layers of compressed ice in glacier C. On the other hand, glacier D didn't have any snowfall, so there is no addition of snow layers to be compressed and contribute to the thickness of its ice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Scientific discourse has drifted to other meanings and there is no consensus on a definition. Emotion is often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, and motivation. In some theories, cognition is an important aspect of emotion. Those acting primarily on the emotions they are feeling may seem as if they are not thinking, but mental processes are still essential, particularly in the interpretation of events. For example, the realization of our believing that we are in a dangerous situation and the subsequent arousal of our body's nervous system (rapid heartbeat and breathing, sweating, muscle tension) is integral to the experience of our feeling afraid. Other theories, however, claim that emotion is separate from and can precede cognition.  - Guadalajara is the capital and largest city of the Mexican state of Jalisco, and the seat of the municipality of Guadalajara.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"The process you described initially is actually incorrect for the respiratory system. The correct process is as follows: 1. Air is drawn in through the mouth or nose. 2. The air travels through the trachea. 3. The air moves into the bronchi, which branch into smaller tubes called bronchioles. 4. The air finally reaches the alveoli, small air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. 5. Oxygen from the air diffuses into the bloodstream, while carbon dioxide from the body diffuses into the alveoli. 6. Carbon dioxide is expelled from the body as you exhale through the mouth or nose. Now, regarding your question about how a higher pH in soil affects the amount of oxygen being brought into the body, the correct answer is - indirectly impacting a step of the process. Increased soil pH may influence plant growth and, in turn, photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants utilize sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. If an increase in soil pH affects plant growth positively, this may lead to increased oxygen production. However, this increased oxygen availability would not specifically impact the steps in the human respiratory process mentioned above. To summarize, a higher soil pH may indirectly impact oxygen availability in the environment by affecting plant growth and photosynthesis, but it will not directly impact the respiratory processes within the human body responsible for oxygen intake and delivery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

September 18, 2017      Factbox: Egypt and North Korea By Margaret Suter      On September 12, during a visit to Seoul, South Korea, Egypt’s Defense Minister reportedly announced that Egypt would be severing military ties with the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea. The alleged announcement and subsequent speculation, which was not immediately confirmed by the Egyptian government, comes as the United States and other members of the international community have repeatedly called on the Egyptian government to cut ties with the isolated hermit state.The official South Korean news agency, Yonhap, reported that Egypt had already cut ties with the DPRK according to the Egyptian Defense Minister Sedki Sobhi. Confusion over the validity of the remarks arose when Egypt’s government neither confirmed nor denied the report. According to Yonhap, Sobhi reportedly said, “Egypt will actively cooperate with South Korea against North Korea acts that threaten peace.”When reached for comment, the Egyptian Army’s official spokesperson, Tamer El Refeai, told Egypt Independent that all the details pertaining to Sobhi’s visit to South Korea were listed on the spokesperson’s official Facebook page . However, the Facebook statement did not include any information on the state of ties between Egypt and North Korea. Several Egyptian news outlets included Sobhi’s comments in their write-ups about the trip, only to remove them later. The daily newspaper, El-Masry El-Youm, initially published his comments in its print edition, but removed them in later iterations.The lack of clarity surrounding the veracity of the comments creates further pressure for the Egyptian government, which has faced increasing demands by one of its main allies and sources of foreign aid, the United States, to scale back its economic ties to North Korea. On August 22, the Trump administration announced its intention to cut 96 million in aid and delay 195 million in military funding to Egypt, citing concerns over Egypt’s human rights record. However, other reports have speculated that the move was part of a broader administration strategy to pressure Egypt into severing ties with the DPRK, further isolating the state from one of its key trading partners.When asked about the decision, a State Department official reportedly said that issues of concern were raised with Cairo, but refused to verify whether Egypt’s relationship with North Korea had factored into the decision.Egypt has long maintained a relationship with the isolated regime in Pyongyang, especially in the arms trade . Egyptian policymakers have viewed North Korea as a key source of military technology since the 1970s when, following North Korea’s support for Egypt in the Yom Kippur War, then-President Anwar Al Sadat agreed to sell Soviet-produced Scud-B missiles to North Korea from 1976-1981. The DPRK returned the favor by supplying technological assistance to Egypt’s missile production.Despite changes in successive governments, Egypt has sustained the arms trade with North Korea. As recently as 2015, the United Nations issued a report confirming that the North Korean Ocean Maritime Management Company (OMM) was a central player in arranging the illicit shipment of concealed arms via individuals and entities based in Egypt, as well as other countries. The report stated that OMM representatives were stationed with a company called the Sunlight Agency in Port Said until at least 2011. In February 2017, UN investigators stated they had uncovered evidence of North Korean trade in “hitherto unreported items such as encrypted military communications, man-portable air defense systems, air defense systems and satellite-guided missiles” in the Middle East and Africa, among other regions. Investigators added that in August 2016, Egypt intercepted a North Korean vessel laden with thirty thousand PG-7 rocket-propelled grenades hidden in wooden crates.In addition to its ongoing military ties, Egypt has maintained a strong economic relationship with the DPRK, as demonstrated by the approximately twenty economic, security, media, technology and cultural agreements established and ongoing with the regime. In 2008, Egyptian telecommunications firm Orascom helped set up the DPRK’s first and only 3G mobile phone network, a deal which Orascom’s billionaire business tycoon Naguib Sawiris oversaw. While critics have questioned whether the arrangement violated UN sanctions and embargos, Sawiris maintains that he has obeyed all UN resolutions and is not in violation of sanctions. The deal reportedly supplied Orascom with 300,000 new North Korean customers and spurred further Egyptian investments in North Korea’s economy. The Egyptian State Information Service, the government’s official channel, states “the volume of the Egyptian Orascom Group’s direct investments in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has exceeded half a billion dollars, which puts Egyptian investments at the top of the pyramid of foreign investments in Korea.” For its part, North Korea exports various goods to Egypt including cars, plastics, and rubbers among others.Cairo has also maintained close diplomatic times with the DPRK, one of three Arab countries (including Syria and Palestine) that operates an embassy in Pyongyang. In addition, Egypt is “one of only five Arab countries to host a North Korean Embassy on its territory, the other countries being Syria, Algeria, Kuwait and Libya.” In 2015, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi invited North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to attend the grand opening of the re-designed Suez Canal, who dispatched the president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea, Kim Yong-nam to attend in his absence.While Egypt’s government has condemned several of the North Korean regime’s recent nuclear tests, in a 2016 television interview , a military spokesman attributed the condemnations to Egypt’s role on the UN Security Council and the need to take a principled stance against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. When questioned about continued US demands for Egypt to shutter its ties with the DPRK, Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid told Al-Monitor, “Egypt is managing its relations with foreign countries based on its own interests and priorities without taking into account any pressures that may hinder the independence of its national decision.” Yet recently, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 2371 with a “yes” vote from Egypt, a signal that Egypt supports much tougher sanctions against North Korea despite the two countries’ long-standing economic and military ties.At the same time, Defense Minister Sobhi’s recent trip to South Korea was meant to show Egypt’s commitment to South Korea, with the aim of boosting military ties between the two countries. With no confirmation as of yet regarding a possible severing of relations with the DPRK, Egypt may be attempting to have its cake and eat it too; however, the recent decision by the Trump Administration to withhold and delay critical aid may be more than Egypt’s fragile economy can endure. Given its relatively weak bargaining power and its substantial and longstanding dependence on its alliance with the US, Egypt may soon succumb to US pressure by officially confirming the severing of ties with North Korea. While the stakes of cutting these ties remain high, the risk of losing a stable and secure partnership with its closest western ally may just be enough to prod Egypt’s reluctance.is an MA graduate from the American University School of International Service International Affairs Program.

Despite increased transparency among the 55% of nations who trade in small arms, the 6bn (£4.5bn) market remains a murky industry in which weapons find their way into the hands of terrorists or are used by states to carry out human rights abuses, according to the Small Arms Survey Trade Update 2017.      Where nations are secretive, evidence is garnered from reports of weapons seizures, including huge hauls from North Korea and Iran.            Two North Korean shipments to Syria intercepted in six months, UN told Read more      In August last year a North Korean vessel was intercepted in Egypt. On board, hidden beneath 2,300 tonnes of iron ore, were 30,000 PG-7 rocket-propelled grenades and their sub components. Suspected North Korean exports of small arms worth 18m and destined for Iran were also intercepted on a plane in Thailand in 2009.            “Such seizures … coupled with other documented small arms trade activities, are sufficient to justify North Korea’s status as a major small arms exporter,” the report said.      “Although Iran, North Korea, and the UAE rarely, if ever, recorded small arms exports worth 10m or more ... survey research indicates that they are major small arms exporters. It is more difficult to determine the status of Saudi Arabia, which appears to be a significant re-exporter of small arms.”      Tens of thousands of rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and more than 350 million rounds of ammunition were exported by eight central and south-east European states to Saudi Arabia between 2012 and 2015, the report said. Such shipments were sent to military bases in Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE and then re-exported to non-Saudi forces in Yemen and Syria.      “Such information indicates that Saudi Arabia also re-exports significant quantities of small arms to armed forces and non-state actors in the Middle East,” the report says.      Irene Pavesi, researcher on the Small Arms Survey, said: “The concealed nature of the small arms trade increases the chances that the transferred weapons will end up in the wrong hands, and help fuel conflict, insecurity and instability around the world.”      Analysis of the flow of deadly weaponry across the globe by the experts based in Geneva also shows:      Brazil has for the first time emerged as among the top five exporters of machine guns, rockets mortars, and other small arms, along with the US, Germany, South Korea and Italy.      The UK is among the top importers of small arms, its trade increased by 18% between 2013 and 2014 to reach 109m, mostly for the civilian market.      Weapons exported or re-exported from North Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia and UAE are getting into the hands of armed militant groups in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon.            Iraq was among the top 10 importers of small arms in 2014 in a trade worth 139m, up from 10m in 2013.      The US remains the world’s largest exporter of small arms, with exports worth 1.1bn in 2014.      Even nations which aim to be transparent and above board can see weapons fall into the wrong hands. A UN report earlier this year revealed Brazilian weapons makers shipped handguns which were supposed to be destined for Djibouti to a Yemeni arms dealer three months after the imposition of an arms embargo.            I’ve seen how arms sales fuel deadly suffering in Yemen. We must stop them | Radhya al-Mutawakel Read more      In 2015 – the year of the Bataclan, Bardo museum and Charlie Hebdo attacks – there were more terrorist attacks carried out with Kalashnikovs than any other weaponry, raising huge concerns about how the legal weapons can end up on the illicit market and in the hands of terrorists.      Paul Holtom, of the Small Arms Survey said there was still a lack of transparency in the industry. “We know that complete transparency is not possible, but as a public watchdog our role is to make sure the trade in small arms is not supplying weapons that are going to end up in the hands of terrorists. At the moment we cannot say that.”      In July campaigners against the arms trade lost a case in the UK high court calling for Britain to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia because of concerns over the civilian toll of its two-year bombing campaign in Yemen.            Half of the evidence was heard in secret on national security grounds. ||||| Under Kim Jong Un, North Korea has advanced its ballistic missile and nuclear weapon technology at an unprecedented rate. Here are a few key tests under Kim Jong Un’s rule and the resulting U.N. Security Council sanctions. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)      Under Kim Jong Un, North Korea has advanced its ballistic missile and nuclear weapon technology at an unprecedented rate. Here are a few key tests under Kim Jong Un’s rule and the resulting U.N. Security Council sanctions. (Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)      Last August, a secret message was passed from Washington to Cairo warning about a mysterious vessel steaming toward the Suez Canal. The bulk freighter named Jie Shun was flying Cambodian colors but had sailed from North Korea, the warning said, with a North Korean crew and an unknown cargo shrouded by heavy tarps.      Armed with this tip, customs agents were waiting when the ship entered Egyptian waters. They swarmed the vessel and discovered, concealed under bins of iron ore, a cache of more than 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades. It was, as a United Nations report later concluded, the “largest seizure of ammunition in the history of sanctions against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.”      But who were the rockets for? The Jie Shun’s final secret would take months to resolve and would yield perhaps the biggest surprise of all: The buyers were the Egyptians themselves.      A U.N. investigation uncovered a complex arrangement in which Egyptian business executives ordered millions of dollars worth of North Korean rockets for the country’s military while also taking pains to keep the transaction hidden, according to U.S. officials and Western diplomats familiar with the findings. The incident, many details of which were never publicly revealed, prompted the latest in a series of intense, if private, U.S. complaints over Egyptian efforts to obtain banned military hardware from Pyongyang, the officials said.      It also shed light on a little-understood global arms trade that has become an increasingly vital financial lifeline for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the wake of unprecedented economic sanctions.      President Trump tweeted Sunday, Oct. 1, saying he told Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with North Korea. (Reuters)      [Do sanctions against North Korea work?]      A statement from the Egyptian Embassy in Washington pointed to Egypt’s “transparency” and cooperation with U.N. officials in finding and destroying the contraband.      “Egypt will continue to abide by all Security Council resolutions and will always be in conformity with these resolutions as they restrain military purchases from North Korea,” the statement said.      But U.S. officials confirmed that delivery of the rockets was foiled only when U.S. intelligence agencies spotted the vessel and alerted Egyptian authorities through diplomatic channels — essentially forcing them to take action — said current and former U.S. officials and diplomats briefed on the events. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. and U.N. findings, said the Jie Shun episode was one of a series of clandestine deals that led the Trump administration to freeze or delay nearly 300 million in military aid to Egypt over the summer.      Whether North Korea was ever paid for the estimated 23 million rocket shipment is unclear. But the episode illustrates one of the key challenges faced by world leaders in seeking to change North Korea’s behavior through economic pressure. Even as the United States and its allies pile on the sanctions, Kim continues to quietly reap profits from selling cheap conventional weapons and military hardware to a list of customers and beneficiaries that has at times included Iran, Burma, Cuba, Syria, Eritrea and at least two terrorist groups, as well as key U.S. allies such as Egypt, analysts said.      [How has North Korea managed to make rapid gains in its missile program?]      Some customers have long-standing military ties with Pyongyang, while others have sought to take advantage of the unique market niche created by North Korea: a kind of global eBay for vintage and refurbished Cold War-era weapons, often at prices far lower than the prevailing rates.      North Korean soldiers carrying packs marked with a radioactive symbol take part in a 2013 military parade in Pyongyang. North Korea has been selling small arms around the world to bring in the hard currency it needs to survive. (Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images)      Over time, the small-arms trade has emerged as a reliable source of cash for a regime with considerable expertise in the tactics of running contraband, including the use of “false flag” shipping and the clever concealment of illegal cargo in bulk shipments of legitimate goods such as sugar or — as in the case of the Jie Shun — a giant mound of loose iron ore.      “These cover materials not only act to obfuscate shipments, but really highlights the way that licit North Korean businesses are being used to facilitate North Korean illicit activity,” said David Thompson, a senior analyst and investigator of North Korean financial schemes for the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, a nonprofit research organization based in Washington. “It is this nesting which makes this illicit activity so hard to identify.”      With North Korea’s other profitable enterprises being hurt by international sanctions, Thompson said, such exports are now “likely more important than ever.”      Beneath yellow rocks      Even by North Korean standards, the Jie Shun was a veritable rust bucket. The freighter’s steel frame was corroded from bow to stern, and its fixtures caked with coal dust from previous voyages, U.N. investigators would later report. The desalination system had stopped working, judging from crates of water bottles officials would find strewn around the crew compartments. Whether its weapons were discovered or not, the ship’s 8,000-mile voyage last summer was probably destined to be its last.      “The ship was in terrible shape,” said a Western diplomat familiar with confidential reports from the official U.N. inquest. “This was a one-shot voyage, and the boat was probably intended for the scrap yard afterward.”      [Photos of the Jie Shun show how rocket-propelled grenades were concealed under iron ore]      Seaworthy or not, the ship set sail from the port city of Haeju, North Korea, on July 23, 2016, with a 23-member North Korean crew that included a captain and a political officer to ensure Communist Party discipline on board. Although North Korean-owned, the vessel had been registered in Cambodia, allowing it to fly a Cambodian flag and claim Phnom Penh as its home port. Using a “flag of convenience,” as the tactic is called, allows North Korean ships to avoid drawing unwanted attention in international waters. So does the practice of routinely shutting off a vessel’s transponder, behavior documented in a February U.N. report that described the Jie Shun’s voyage.      “The vessel’s automatic identification system was off for the majority of the voyage,” the report said, “except in busy sea lanes where such behavior could be noticed and assessed as a safety threat.”      Still, a 300-foot-long freighter big enough to hold 2,400 passenger cars is not easily concealed. U.S. intelligence agencies tracked the ship as it left North Korea, and then monitored it as it steamed around the Malay Peninsula and sailed westward across the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The vessel was heading northward through the Red Sea in early August when the warning was passed to Egyptian authorities about a suspicious North Korean vessel that appeared bound for the Suez Canal.      “They were notified by our side,” said a former senior U.S. official with direct knowledge of the events. “I give their foreign ministry credit for taking it seriously.”      The Jie Shun had not yet reached the canal when an Egyptian naval vessel ordered the crew to halt for an inspection. At first, the cargo hold appeared to match the description on the manifest: 2,300 tons of loose yellow rocks called limonite, a kind of iron ore. But digging beneath stone and tarp, the inspectors found wooden crates — stacks of them.      Asked about the boxes, the crew produced a bill of lading listing the contents, in awkward English, as “assembly parts of the underwater pump.” But after the last of the 79 crates was unloaded and opened at Egypt’s al-Adabiyah port, it was clear that this was a weapons shipment like none other: more than 24,000 rocket-propelled grenades, and completed components for 6,000 more. All were North Korean copies of a rocket warhead known as the PG-7, a variant of a Soviet munition first built in the 1960s.      [North Korea defies predictions — again — with early grasp of weapons milestone]      A closer examination by U.N. experts would reveal yet another deception, this one apparently intended to fool the weapons’ Egyptian recipients: Each of the rockets bore a stamp with a manufacturing date of March 2016, just a few months before the Jie Shun sailed. But the label, like the manifest, was false.      “On-site analysis revealed that they were not of recent production,” the U.N. report said, “but rather had been stockpiled for some time.”      A worldwide customer base      North Korea’s booming illicit arms trade is an outgrowth of a legitimate business that began decades ago. In the 1960s and ’70s, the Soviet Union gave away conventional weapons — and, in some cases, entire factories for producing them — to developing countries as a way of winning allies and creating markets for Soviet military technology. Many of these client states would standardize the use of communist-bloc munitions and weapons systems in their armies, thus ensuring a steady demand for replacement parts and ammunition that would continue well into the future.      Sensing an opportunity, North Korea obtained licenses to manufacture replicas of Soviet and Chinese weapons, ranging from assault rifles and artillery rockets to naval frigates and battle tanks. Arms factories sprouted in the 1960s that soon produced enough weapons to supply North Korea’s vast military, as well as a surplus that could be sold for cash.      [How Russia quietly undercuts sanctions intended to stop North Korea’s nuclear program]      By the end of the Cold War, North Korea’s customer base spanned four continents and included dozens of countries, as well as armed insurgencies. The demand for discount North Korean weapons would continue long after the Soviet Union collapsed, and even after North Korea came under international censure and economic isolation because of its nuclear weapons program, said Andrea Berger, a North Korea specialist and senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, Calif.      “North Korea’s assistance created a legacy of dependency,” said Berger, author of “Target Markets,” a 2015 monograph on the history of Pyongyang’s arms exports. “The type of weaponry that these [client] countries still have in service is largely based on communist-bloc designs from the Cold War era. North Korea has started to innovate and move beyond those designs, but it is still willing to provide spare parts and maintenance. As the Russians and Chinese have moved away from this market, the North Koreans have stuck around.”      As a succession of harsh U.N. sanctions threatened to chase away customers, North Korea simply changed tactics. Ships that ferried artillery rockets and tank parts to distant ports changed their names and registry papers so they could sail under a foreign flag. New front companies sprang up in China and Malaysia to handle transactions free of any visible connection to Pyongyang. A mysterious online weapons vendor called Glocom — jokingly dubbed the “Samsung of North Korean proliferators” by some Western investigators — began posting slick videos hawking a variety of wares ranging from military radios to guidance systems for drones, never mentioning North Korea as the source.      The sanctions stigma inevitably scared away some potential buyers, but the trading in the shadows remains brisk, intelligence officials and Western diplomats say. Some remaining clients are fellow pariah states such as Syria, whose recent purchases have included chemical-weapons protective gear. Other long-term customers are nonstate actors such as the militant group Hezbollah, which has acquired North Korean rockets and missiles from arms smugglers and sympathetic regimes. North Korean-made rifles have even been recovered from the bodies of Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria, although U.S. officials believe the guns were probably looted from stocks sold to the late Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi years earlier.      Still other customers look to North Korea as one of the last suppliers of low-cost parts and ammunition for older weapons systems that are scarcely found in commercial markets. The list includes sub-Saharan African countries such as Uganda and Congo, which for decades relied on North Korea to train and equip their armies.      The list also includes Egypt, a major U.S. aid recipient that still maintains diplomatic ties and has a history of military-to-military ties dating back to the 1970s with Pyongyang, said Berger, the Middlebury researcher. Although Cairo has publicly sworn off dealing with North Korea, she said, incidents such as the Jie Shun show how hard it is to break old habits, especially for military managers seeking to extend the life of costly weapons systems.      Egypt’s army today still has dozens of weapons systems that were originally of Soviet design. Among them are at least six types of antitank weapons, including the RPG-7, the 1960s-era grenade-launcher that uses the same PG-7 warhead as those discovered on the Jie Shun. The number of Egyptian RPG-7 tubes in active service has been estimated at nearly 180,000.      “Egypt was a consistent North Korean customer in the past,” Berger said. “I would call them a ‘resilient’ customer today.”      Diplomatic turbulence      When Egyptian officials were first confronted about their country’s possible ties to the Jie Shun’s rockets, the response was denial, followed by obfuscation, Western diplomats said.      At the time of the discovery, Egypt was a newly elected nonpermanent member of the U.N. Security Council, and its delegation resisted including information in official reports linking Egyptian officials or businesses to illicit North Korean weapons, said U.S. officials and diplomats familiar with the discussions. The embassy statement said Egyptian officials sought only minor delays to ensure that their views on the events were properly reflected. It noted that Security Council officials had “recognized and praised Egypt’s role” in assisting the investigation.      In any case, the February U.N. report on the incident sidesteps the question of who was meant to receive the rockets, saying only that the munitions were destroyed by Egypt under U.N. supervision, and that “the destination and end user of the equipment was investigated by the Egyptian general prosecutor.”      But evidence gathered by U.N. investigators and later shared with diplomats left little doubt about where the rockets were bound. An early clue was the nature of the rockets themselves: All were practice rounds — fitted with removable, nonlethal warheads of the type used in military training — and the large quantity suggested that the purchaser had a sizable army with many thousands of recruits. Egypt’s active-duty military is 438,000 strong, with another 479,000 reservists.      The most damning evidence was discovered on the crates. Each had been stenciled with the name of an Egyptian company, but someone had taken trouble of covering the lettering with a canvas patch. Diplomats familiar with the investigation confirmed the involvement of the Egyptian company, but declined to name it.      Likewise, the Egyptian company is identified nowhere in the U.N. report. A single footnote states, cryptically: “National authorities closed the private company and revoked its license.”      While U.S. officials have declined to publicly criticize Egypt, the Jie Shun incident — coming on top of other reported weapons deals with North Korea in recent years — contributed to the diplomatic turbulence that defined relations between Cairo and the Obama and Trump administrations. U.S. officials confirmed that the rockets were among the factors leading to the Trump administration’s decision in July to freeze or delay 290 million in military aid to Egypt.      During Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi’s visit to Washington that month, President Trump praised the military strongman before TV cameras for “doing a fantastic job.” But a White House statement released afterward made clear that a warning had been delivered in private.      “President Trump stressed the need for all countries to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea,” said the official statement, including the need to “stop providing economic or military benefits to North Korea.”      Read more:      How North Koreans are escaping the clutches of Kim Jong Un      North Korea’s surprising, lucrative relationship with Africa      China watches in frustration as North Korea crisis enters dangerous spiral ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"North Korea has been supplying Egypt with weapons and equipment despite the tightening of economic sanctions, according to US officials and Western diplomats.

The tweet states, \\"wishing a had a new car already.\\" This expression can be read in several ways, each of which may convey a distinct sentiment. Firstly, focusing on the feeling of desire for a new car, one could argue that the tweet has a positive sentiment. The individual expresses an aspiration, which implies they might be in a phase of life where they are looking forward to or actively pursuing this goal. This outlook reflects a sense of optimism and hope for the future. However, by honing in on the word \\"already,\\" it is also possible to frame the tweet as having a negative sentiment. This specific word choice implies a level of impatience or frustration, suggesting that the individual is unhappy with their current situation. They might be experiencing dissatisfaction with their current car, or perhaps facing difficulties in acquiring a new vehicle. In this sense, the tweet conveys a more negative tone. Taking both of these perspectives into consideration, it is important to recognize that the sentiment of a tweet or statement is not always straightforward, and can encompass multiple layers of meaning. It can be particularly challenging to discern the intended sentiment in a brief tweet with limited context.

While they both deal with the comparison of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), they approach the subject from different angles. The first question asks for the differences between the two disorders, while the second question seeks to understand their similarities. Differences between Borderline Personality Disorder and Narcissistic Personality Disorder: 1. Emotion Regulation: BPD is characterized by intense emotional instability, fear of abandonment, sudden mood swings, and outbursts of anger. Individuals with BPD often experience chronic feelings of emptiness and are prone to self-harm or suicidal thoughts. NPD, on the other hand, involves feelings of grandiosity, exaggerated self-importance, and a constant need for admiration. They may exhibit limited empathy and are often insensitive to the needs of others. 2. Relationships: People with BPD often experience unstable and tumultuous relationships, as they struggle to maintain close connections while fearing abandonment. They may have intense and fluctuating emotions, making it difficult for them to form consistent and trusting relationships. On the contrary, those with NPD can be controlling and manipulative in relationships. They frequently lack empathy and understanding, seeing others as mere extensions of themselves or as instruments to achieve their goals. 3. Self-Image: Individuals with BPD often struggle with identity issues and have an unstable self-image. They may adjust their values and beliefs according to their environment or the people they interact with in an effort to fit in. Conversely, individuals with NPD possess an inflated sense of self-worth, feeling superior to others, and believing they deserve special treatment. 4. Handling Criticism: People with BPD are usually sensitive to criticism and can react with intense anger or self-destructive behavior when they perceive rejection. In contrast, those with NPD often respond to criticism with disdain or by outright dismissing remarks, as they are unable to tolerate any perceived threat to their self-image. Similarities between Borderline Personality Disorder and Narcissistic Personality Disorder: 1. Both are classified as Cluster B personality disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). This classification includes disorders characterized by dramatic, emotional, or erratic behavior, making it difficult for individuals to form healthy, functioning relationships. 2. Both disorders involve problems with emotional regulation, self-image, interpersonal relationships, and empathy. For instance, those with BPD or NPD may have difficulty bonding with others, understanding other people's feelings, or maintaining stable relationships. 3. Early childhood experiences and attachment issues may contribute to the development of both BPD and NPD. People with either disorder may struggle with unresolved traumas or unmet emotional needs, which can manifest in their adult lives as relationship issues or emotional difficulties. 4. Treatment options for both BPD and NPD involve various forms of psychotherapy, such as dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or psychodynamic therapy. The treatment process can be lengthy and challenging for both individuals and their therapists, as the disorders feature ingrained patterns of thought and behavior that require time and effort to modify. In summary, although the two questions posed explore the relationship between BPD and NPD, they address different aspects of the disorders. The first question seeks to understand the differences between them, while the second question aims to discover their similarities. Understanding both the differences and similarities can provide valuable insights into the unique challenges faced by individuals with these disorders and inform effective treatment strategies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: The addictive pull of Internet shopping is dragging thousands of victims into a rise of debt, including thousands of women who have run up huge credit card bills they cannot repay.  The appeal of 24-hour access and the explosion in goods and services on offer has seen a 10 percent increase in credit card debts in the UK this year.  Much of it has accounted for online spending. The latest report on Internet usage shows the number of adults logging on at home has risen from 10 million in October last year to 15.5m this month.  The report by Continental Research, which has monitored Internet access in the UK for the past six years, found that while online shopping used to be experimental it is now becoming habitual, especially for women.  Colin Shaddick, who heads the company, said, \\"Women are logging on in record numbers ---online shopping has certainly played a big role in this.\\" The study found that average annual spending online is PS700 a year for each Internet shopper.  The draw of the Internet is especially strong for collectors. Business lecturer Stephen Hall, who has been buying and selling books since he was a child, now has a collection worth PS40,000.  He is passionate about the opportunities offered by shopping online. \\"You can find a book in minutes that you could spend months hunting down at auctions or second-hand bookshops,\\" he said. \\"It can easily become addictive, and all the collectors I know use the Internet. I suspect you do waste money because you are less likely to send back a book to Little Rock, Arkansas, than take it back to the high-street shop.\\" Like Stephen Hall, most of us can shop online sensibly---but for some it provides an easy, anonymous and accessible way to feed their habit. It also provides secrecy---a central part of any addiction. Dr Samantha Haslett, a psychologist and expert in addiction at the Promos counseling centre, said, \\"It's compulsive in the same way as alcohol and gambling, and addicts find themselves completely unable to stop themselves, despite debt mounting... The answer is:","output":"Question: According to the article, what factors contribute to the addictive nature of online shopping and the increase in credit card debt in the UK? A) 24-hour access and a wide variety of goods and services B) Ease of finding and purchasing collectible items C) Secrecy and anonymity of online transactions D) All of the above Answer: D) All of the above Step 1: Read and comprehend the article. In the article, it is mentioned that thousands of people, particularly women, are falling into debt due to the addictive nature of online shopping. The article points towards an increase in credit card debts in the UK. Step 2: Identify the main points that reveal the contributing factors for the addictive nature of online shopping. The article mentions 24-hour access, a wide range of products, ease in finding collectible items, and the secure and anonymous nature of online transactions as the main factors contributing to the increasing debts and addiction to online shopping. Step 3: Formulate a multiple-choice question based on the main points. Create a question that highlights the factors mentioned in the article, and ensure that all the available options reflect the information provided therein. Step 4: Provide the appropriate answer based on the article. Since all the factors mentioned in the article contribute to the addictive nature of online shopping, the correct answer should include all of them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Combined infections with influenza viruses and PRCV did not appear to enhance the pathogenicity of these viruses. Furthermore, viruses were isolated more frequently from tissues and nasal swabs taken from 'single' than 'dual' infected animals, suggesting a possible in vivo interference between replication of PRCV and swine influenza virus.

Article: For many children of traditional parents, marrying is only an option the parents will consider once the child's college or career education is complete, and a steady (and respectable) job has been held by the child for at least 1-2 years. Approaching them with the idea of marriage before you graduate can understandably feel like you're endangering their hard work. Waiting, in that case, is best. Belittling them, comparing your behavior to theirs, and otherwise insulting them  will not change their mind and is not your role as a respectful and loving child. First, ask your parents how they feel, what they like, what they don't like in the current situation, and what they expect you to do. Be silent until they finish explaining what they think about the situation. “I'd like to hear what you think about all this.”  Once they finish explaining, they will definitely ask some questions to you (and the girl, if she is present in the room) in terms of how to approach this whole thing, finances, your future, and other general topics—all of which you should try to answer. The temptation to avoid answering their questions might be strong, especially if you find you have not thought through an issue they raise or if you do not yet have an answer you like. You can always return to the conversation, but try to answer fully and be honest about where you struggle with their questions. If their explanation presents another situation that gives a feasible solution for everyone, then take it up. Don't keep your feelings or relationship a secret. Hiding a serious relationship from your family can be quite painful for them and suggest to them that you do not trust or respect them. Wouldn't you feel the same if they had hidden some tremendously important relationship from you? Unless you have a strong reason for not telling them (for example, you have not yet graduated from the college they are paying for), you should be honest with your parents sooner, rather than later.

The film opens with the mirroring of a gloomy sky on the placid Baltic Sea waters at the Faro Island shores, near Gotland's northernmost tip. Four bathers, all in a jovial mood, splashing and joking, are returning from a swim in the cold sea. As they reach the jetty, the youngest members of the quartet, Karin (Harriet Andersson) and her teenage brother, Fredrik, known as Minus (Lars Passgard), are sent off to get some milk at a nearby farm, while Karin's physician husband, Martin (Max von Sydow), and her father, David (Gunnar Bjorstrand), a writer, go and set up their fishing nets. David has just returned from Switzerland, where he was finishing writing his latest novel, and their task gives them a private opportunity to discuss Karin's status, whose schizophrenia has been diagnosed as most likely incurable.On the way to the farm, Minus expresses his hope that their father will be successful with his latest novel's publication. On the way back, Minus confides in his sister his sexual apprehensions, which eventually degenerates into his admonishment of Karin for the (maybe) too intimate attention she keeps showing toward him.

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Light may be refracted by matter. The light is bent when it passes from one type of matter to another. Refraction of light is similar to refraction of sound waves. You can also read more about refraction of light in the lesson “Optics. ”.   Choices:  - vibration  - reflection  - resonance  - refraction   A: Answer:","output":"Refraction When light bends as it passes from one type of matter to another, the phenomenon that occurs is called refraction. When light travels through different media with different refractive indices, the speed at which it travels changes, causing the light to change direction and bend. This is similar to the refraction of sound waves, which also involves the change in speed and direction of waves as they pass through different media. In the provided paragraph, the text explains that light may be refracted by matter, and this bending of light occurs when it passes from one type of matter to another. It also mentions that refraction of light is similar to refraction of sound waves and could be further studied in the lesson on \\"Optics.\\" From the given choices - vibration, reflection, resonance, and refraction - the correct option that accurately describes the phenomenon of light bending as it passes from one type of matter to another in the context of the paragraph is refraction. Refraction has practical applications in everyday life and technology, including the use of lenses in eyeglasses to correct vision problems, cameras to focus light on film or digital sensors, and the formation of rainbows as sunlight passes through raindrops. Understanding refraction is essential for explaining various optical effects and developing sophisticated optical instruments."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - boiling water - pacific ocean - cold water - a huge knife - fish market  The answer is \\"boiling water\\" because Answer:","output":"The crab was startled when it saw something in the kitchen, and the answer is \\"boiling water\\" because this represents the most immediate and significant source of danger to the crab. Boiling water is often used in the process of cooking crabs, making it the most relevant and threatening variable for the crab among the other options provided. Option one, the Pacific Ocean, does not make sense in the context, as oceans are typically not found inside kitchens. Moreover, the Pacific Ocean, being the crab's natural habitat, would not likely startle or alarm the crab. In fact, the crab might feel more at ease if it were near the ocean. Option two, cold water, while it may be a minor inconvenience for the crab, is not as threatening as boiling water, which would lead to the crab's immediate demise. Cold water may slow down the crab's metabolism, but it does not pose a direct or significant danger to its survival. Option three, a huge knife, might startle the crab, but it is important to consider that, as a crustacean, the crab may not have the cognitive ability to perceive or understand the threat posed by a knife in the same way that humans do. While a knife may be dangerous for the crab in the hands of a human, it would not be a direct cause of harm without human intervention. Option four, fish market, is a place where crabs and other seafood are sold. However, being in a kitchen, a fish market does not fit within the context of the scene. Furthermore, a crab might not be able to comprehend the meaning or purpose of a fish market, and therefore, would likely not find it startling or alarming. In conclusion, the answer is \\"boiling water\\" because of its direct threat to the crab's life and its relevance in the context of a kitchen environment. Boiling water is commonly used to cook crabs, making it the most probable source of alarm among the options provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Mike preferred eating fresh fruit in the morning instead of oatmeal because the","output":"Mike preferred eating fresh fruit in the morning instead of oatmeal because the vibrant flavors and natural juiciness of the fruit provided him with a more pleasurable and invigorating start to his day, activating all of his senses and nourishing his body with essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that maintained optimal health and well-being. There are several reasons why Mike might opt for fresh fruit over oatmeal as his morning meal of choice, including taste preferences, nutritional benefits, and how it affects his overall energy levels throughout the day. Firstly, fresh fruit boasts an assortment of flavors that range from sweet, tangy, to mildly sour, depending on the type of fruit being consumed. This rich diversity appeals not only to Mike's taste buds but also keeps him engaged and excited for breakfast each day. In contrast, oatmeal has a rather neutral and sometimes bland taste that might require additional sweeteners, flavors, or toppings to make it more palatable, which can sometimes lead to the consumption of excess sugars or fats. In terms of nutritional benefits, fresh fruits are an excellent source of essential vitamins, such as vitamin C, which is crucial for supporting the immune system, and vitamin A, which plays a vital role in maintaining healthy skin, vision, and overall growth and development. Additionally, fruits are rich in minerals like potassium, which is necessary for regulating blood pressure, and magnesium, which aids in muscle and nerve function. Moreover, fresh fruits are packed with antioxidants, including flavonoids, polyphenols, and anthocyanins, that help protect the body from free radicals and oxidative stress, thereby reducing the risk of chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Oatmeal also contains beneficial nutrients, such as heart-healthy soluble fiber, B vitamins, iron, and zinc. However, for individuals like Mike, the combination of taste preferences and the nutrient composition of fresh fruit might simply be more appealing for their palates and health goals. Another factor that could influence Mike's choice of fresh fruit over oatmeal is the effect each food has on his energy levels, digestion, and satiety. Fresh fruits, being rich in natural sugars and rapidly digestible carbohydrates, could give Mike quick bursts of energy and help wake up his metabolism, whereas oatmeal, containing complex carbohydrates and proteins, might provide a slower and more sustained release of energy. Depending on Mike's lifestyle and activity levels, he might find that the quicker energy supply from fresh fruits better suits his needs, especially during the early hours of the day. Lastly, for some individuals, the texture and mouthfeel of food play a significant role in their food choices. The soft and juicy textures of fresh fruits can be more enticing and refreshing, while oatmeal has a thicker, denser consistency that some people might find less appealing. Thus, Mike preferred eating fresh fruit in the morning instead of oatmeal because the experience of savoring the diverse range of flavors, availing of the numerous health benefits, and enjoying the natural energy boost and appealing textures provided him with a holistic and satisfying breakfast ritual that left him feeling invigorated and ready to conquer the day ahead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: (CNN) Kim Jong Un is sending his younger sister to South Korea for the Winter Olympics, the first time any member of the Kim dynasty has visited the country.      South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement that Kim Yo Jong will be joining North Korea's high-level delegation to the South, headed by Kim Yong Nam , president of North Korea's parliament.      The 30-year-old, who has seen her profile rise steadily since 2014, was last year promoted to North Korea's Politburo. She and Kim Jong Un were born to the same mother, Ko Yong Hui.      Kim Yo Jong, right, sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, at the official opening of the Ryomyong residential area, April 13, 2017.      Kim Yo Jong's inclusion in the North Korean delegation is likely to irritate the United States, which has sent its own delegation led by Vice President Mike Pence to counter North Korea's charm offensive.      Last year, the US Treasury Department included Kim Yo Jong on its list of blacklisted officials . As the vice director of the Workers' Party Propaganda and Agitation Department, she has been targeted by US sanctions.      On a refueling stop on his way to Asia, Pence said the aim of his trip was to show American \\"resolve\\" in rallying the international community against the Kim regime.      \\"We're traveling to the Olympics to make sure that North Korea doesn't use the powerful symbolism and the backdrop of the Winter Olympics to paper over the truth about their regime,\\" Pence said.

Born September 26, 1987, Kim Yo Jong studied in Switzerland like her brother and is believed to have attended Kim Il Sung University and a western European school for her higher education.      Her position is such that, according to a Seoul-based think tank run by North Korean defectors, Kim Yo Jong briefly took charge of the country while her brother was reportedly ill with gout or diabetes in late 2014.      Hopes for a breakthrough      Kim's presence, alongside Kim Yong Nam (no relation), the 90-year-old ceremonial head of state in North Korea, will raise hopes for a potential breakthrough in relations with the US.      This week, Pence suggested he would be open to meeting North Korean politicians on the sidelines of the Olympics, saying President Donald Trump \\"always believes in talking.\\"      \\"North Korea can have a better future than the militaristic path, the path of provocation and confrontation that it's on. Better for its own people, better for the region, and better for peace,\\" Pence said.      However on Wednesday he also warned the US was about to impose the \\"toughest and most aggressive round of economic sanctions on North Korea ever.\\"      \\"We will continue to isolate North Korea until it abandons its nuclear and ballistic missile programs once and for all,\\" he said.

The display would be an attempt \\"to scare the hell out of the Americans,\\" a diplomatic source told CNN last month. ||||| Image copyright KCNA Image caption Kim Yo-jong in a 2015 picture of her brother touring a military unit      The influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is to attend the Winter Olympic Games which open in Pyeongchang in the South on Friday, ministers in Seoul say.      Kim Yo-jong, a senior Workers' Party official promoted to the politburo last year, will be the first immediate Kim family member to cross the border.      Both Koreas will march under one flag at the opening ceremony.      The North's participation has been seen as a thawing of bilateral ties.      However, the US, Japan and others have accused the North of using the Games for propaganda purposes.      Who is Kim Yo-jong?      Believed to have been born in 1987, she is the youngest daughter of late leader Kim Jong-il and is Kim Jong-un's full sister. She is about four years younger than her brother and is said to be very close to him.      She is reportedly married to the son of Choe Ryong-hae, the powerful party secretary.      Image copyright Reuters Image caption Kim Yo-jong at the opening of a residential complex in Pyongyang in 2017      Kim Yo-jong has been in the spotlight sporadically in recent years, with her main job being to protect her brother's image via her role in the party's propaganda department.      She remains blacklisted by the US over alleged links to human rights abuses in North Korea.      A message from her brother?      Analysis: BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul      This is a huge surprise. There had been speculation Kim Yo-jong might be part of the delegation but few thought it would actually happen. It is being seen as a sign that Kim Jong-un is serious about improving ties with South Korea.      Kim Yo-jong is one of Kim Jong-un's closest aides and some are speculating that she might be bringing a message from her brother.      But there could be a number of obstacles to overcome if she is to make it to Pyeongchang. She is targeted by US sanctions for alleged human rights abuses, although she is not on the UN Security Council travel blacklist.      There is also the question of how she will get to the Games. Seoul has had to request special permission from the US and others in the international community to allow North Korean athletes and performers to travel south by bus and ferry. They may have to do so again and this time it will be for a member of Kim Jong-un's own family.      How rare is this visit?      It would be the first by a direct member of the Kim dynasty.      Chang Song-thaek, Kim Jong-un's uncle and brother in law of Kim Jong-il, did travel to the South but did not belong to the Baekdu blood line, which is considered significant.      There is speculation in the South that this is part of Kim Yo-jong's grooming for greater power, and that she could be bringing a letter from her brother to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who she is likely to meet.      It is unclear whether Kim Yo-jong will be at the opening ceremony on Friday.      Who else is in the delegation?      Politically, four figures, including Kim Yo-jong, are key. The others are:      Kim Yong-nam . North Korea's ceremonial head of state, the president of its parliament. The diplomatically sure-footed 90-year-old has seen the rule of all three North Korean leaders and has travelled overseas before      .

Drip, drip, drip of PR      Michael Madden, North Korea leadership expert      In announcing its delegates both to the 2018 Winter Olympics and the inter-Korean culture events on the sidelines, Pyongyang let out the information in a slow drip.      Part of this is Pyongyang maximising the positive PR effects. The announcement of the full delegation came following the arrival of its athletes to the Games late last week, and one day after 10 musicians arrived in South Korea.      So now North Korea has earned itself a third day of positive media coverage about its participation in the Olympics.      How have others reacted?      The US is scornful of the North's motives over the Olympics and is sending Vice-President Mike Pence to the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang to counter what it terms propaganda.      Image copyright Reuters Image caption Both the US and Japan have been critical of the North's Olympics policy      \\"We're travelling to the Olympics to make sure that North Korea doesn't use the powerful symbolism in the backdrop of the Winter Olympics to paper over the truth about their regime,\\" he said.      He was in Tokyo on Wednesday and maintained the pressure, announcing that \\"the United States will soon unveil the toughest and most aggressive round of economic sanctions on North Korea\\".      Japan has been equally sceptical. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said: \\"We must not be fooled by North Korea's 'smile diplomacy'.\\"      Where are we on North-South ties?      North Korea currently faces growing international pressure and sanctions over its nuclear and missile programmes.      Its latest ballistic missile test, on 28 November, sparked a new series of measures from the UN, targeting petrol shipments and travel for North Koreans, and a war of words between the North and US President Donald Trump.      Kim Jong-un then extended a New Year's olive branch to the South over participation in the Olympics, which run from 9 to 25 February.      The perceived warming of ties has not been without difficulties, not least the North's decision to move a military parade in Pyongyang from April to the day before the opening of the Games. ||||| FILE - This 2015, file photo provided by the North Korean government shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his sister Kim Yo Jong, left, during their visit to a military unit in North Korea.

(Associated Press) FILE - This 2015, file photo provided by the North Korean government shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his sister Kim Yo Jong, left, during their visit to a military unit in North Korea. South... (Associated Press)      SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's sister, an increasingly prominent figure in the country's leadership, will be part of the North's delegation to the South Korean Winter Olympics, officials said Wednesday.      Kim Yo Jong, believed to be around 30, will be the first member of North Korea's ruling family to visit South Korea since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Analysts say her inclusion in the Olympic delegation shows North Korea's ambition to use the Olympics to break out from diplomatic isolation by improving relations with the South, which it could use as a bridge for approaching the United States.      By sending a youthful, photogenic person who will undoubtedly attract international attention during the Olympics, North Korea is also trying to construct a fresher and warmer public image and defuse potential U.S. efforts to use the Pyeongchang Games to highlight the North's brutal human rights record, experts say.      Kim Jong Un might also have seen that U.S. President Donald Trump was sending his daughter, Ivanka, to the Olympics ceremony and decided to match the move by sending his sister, said Hong Min, an analyst at Seoul's Korea Institute for National Unification.      By sending a relative, \\"Kim Jong Un may be trying to present himself as an equal to Donald Trump,\\" Hong said.      South Korea's Unification Ministry said North Korea informed it that Kim Yo Jong, first vice director of the Central Committee of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, would be part of the delegation led by the country's nominal head of state, Kim Yong Nam.      The ministry said Kim Yo Jong's schedule in the South has yet to be determined, and it wasn't immediately clear whether she will meet with President Moon Jae-in, a liberal who has expressed a desire to reach out to the North.      Moon's office welcomed the decision to send Kim Yo Jong, which it said showed the North's willingness to cooperate in efforts to ease tensions in the Korean Peninsula.      \\"First Vice Director Kim Yo Jong is Chairman Kim Jong Un's sister who has an important role in the Workers' Party, (so her visit) is that much more meaningful,\\" presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said in a statement read on television.      Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Dongguk University, said Kim Yo Jong, as Kim Jong Un's relative and apparently one of the few people who has earned his absolute trust, carries more weight as a dialogue partner for the South than any other official the North could send.      It's unclear whether any member of the North Korean government delegation will hold talks with U.S. officials during the Olympics. But Kim Yo Jong's presence would give North Korea a better opportunity to win South Korean help in reaching out to the United States, Hong said. He also said Washington may see Kim Yo Jong as an avenue to deliver messages to Kim Jong Un.      \\"With any other North Korean official, even the so-called No. 2 Choe Ryong Hae, you are getting a person who's just parroting orders given by Kim Jong Un,\\" Hong said. \\"But with Kim Yo Jong, you are getting a person who's chiefly involved in designing Kim Jong Un's rule, a person whom the leader actually listens to.\\"      North Korea said the delegation will also include Choe Hwi, chairman of the country's National Sports Guidance Committee, and Ri Son Gwon, chairman of the North's agency that deals with inter-Korean affairs.      Seoul previously said the delegation would arrive Friday, but Wednesday's statement was the first confirmation that a member of the North's ruling family will be included.      Kim Yo Jong and Kim Jong Un were born to the same mother, Ko Yong Hui. They had a half brother, Kim Jong Nam, who was murdered last year at a Malaysian airport.      Kim Yo Jong was promoted by her brother last year to be an alternate member of the decision-making political bureau of the ruling party's central committee, which analysts said showed that her activities are more substantive than previously thought.      The war-separated Koreas are cooperating on a series of conciliatory measures during the Olympics, which the South sees as an opportunity to ease tensions with the North following an extended period of animosity over its nuclear weapon and missile programs. Skeptics think North Korea is trying to use the Olympics to weaken U.S.-led sanctions and pressure against it and buy time to advance its weapons programs.      North Korea has 22 athletes competing in the Winter Olympics but also has sent performing artists and a large cheering group.      A decision by North Korea to send the artists by sea has triggered debate in the South, where conservatives see the move as a clear indication the North is trying to use the Olympics to ease sanctions against it.      South Korea is deciding whether to accept North Korea's request that it provide fuel for the ferry that transported the artists. Seoul exempted the ferry from sanctions to allow it in South Korean waters.      \\"We will closely discuss with the United States and other related nations the matter of providing convenience to the Mangyongbong ferry so that no problem regarding sanctions would occur,\\" said Seoul's Unification Ministry spokesman, Baik Tae-hyun. |||||Summary:","output":"Kim Yo-Jong, the younger sister of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un, is set to attend the Winter Olympic Games in South Korea. As part of a North Korean delegation, her inclusion could provoke an irritated response from the US, whose delegation is headed up by vice-president Mike Pence. The visit marks the first time a member of the Kim dynasty has visited South Korea, and signifies the continuing commitment to the easing of tensions between the two nations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Steven always calculate the risks before they invest but Benjamin doesn't as","output":"he relies on his instinct and intuition. These two friends, each with their own investment philosophy, had known each other since they were kids. They grew up in the same neighborhood, went to the same school, and even attended the same college, majoring in finance. Everything was fine until one day, they decided to start a small hedge fund together. Their partnership was natural and seemed promising, blending technical analysis and gut-driven instincts. They believed it would be the perfect combination to yield strong returns. Yet, they never could have anticipated the series of events that would unfold in the years to come. Their business grew successfully for a few years, outperforming the market averages and catching the attention of affluent investors. As the fund amassed more capital, the difference in their investment styles began to strain the partnership. Steven strictly adhered to quantitative analysis, crunching numbers and meticulously identifying opportunities with statistical support. Benjamin, on the other hand, relied on his innate ability to read people, market sentiment, and focus on innovative companies with tremendous growth potential. It was 2006, and Benjamin had his eyes set on a new tech startup with a revolutionary idea to change the way people communicate. The company was in its infancy and seemed promising, despite the inherent risks. However, when he suggested allocating a significant portion of the fund's assets to invest in the company, Steven resisted. Steven's calculations indicated that the company's financials didn't support its lofty projections, and the risk was too great for the fund. After heated debates and sleepless nights, they compromised. Benjamin would take a small percentage of the fund to invest in the startup, but only after both agreed to diversify the portfolio into several other ventures. They shook hands, confident that their differing approaches would secure the fund's future. Benjamin's startup investment began to take off, and by 2008, it turned into a seismic disruptor in the tech industry. The company was none other than Facebook. The tremendous success of their early investment sent the hedge fund's worth skyrocketing. What was initially thought to be an unfortunate compromise between the two friends became their crowning achievement. Despite the success, the financial unrest of the 2008 market crash was looming on the horizon. The economy was shaking, and tensions between Steven and Benjamin grew. Steven, true to his analytical roots, began focusing on safe investments, choosing conservative plays that would buffer against the potential collapse. Benjamin, emboldened by his previous success, insisted on betting big on new, innovative companies - ones equally as risky as Facebook had been. When the market crash eventually struck, the rift between them intensified. Though they managed to survive through the prudent diversification Steven had insisted upon, Benjamin's high-risk investments faltered. Steven, disappointed in his friend's inability to acknowledge the risk, decided it was time to part ways professionally. The hedge fund, once a testament to the power of combined wisdom, would be no more. The two friends agreed to dissolve it and split the remaining assets. They each started their respective ventures, with Steven founding a new fund based on data-driven investment strategies and Benjamin creating a venture capital firm that continued to focus on risky, avant-garde companies. As the years passed, their paths rarely crossed. Their once-strong friendship was reduced to a series of curt emails, discussing what was left of their joint investments. Both went on to achieve individual success. Steven's fund thrived in a world that increasingly valued the power of data and analytics, while Benjamin's venture capital firm discovered several successful startups, making him a renowned name in the industry. Despite their diverging paths, they would always remember their humble beginnings and how they complemented each other perfectly in those early years. It was only in the twilight of their careers that Steven and Benjamin met again for one final time. They shared old memories and acknowledged the role each played in molding the other's life and career. As they bid each other farewell, they couldn't help but wonder how their future would have unfolded if they had found a way to nurture their contrasting styles. But life had its way of teaching lessons, and this was one of them. The story of Steven and Benjamin would be passed down to future generations as a parable of how the marriage of two contrasting investment philosophies could lead to great success if nurtured and respected, and the importance of friendship over ego."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When the phrase \\"Fourth, we conducted a quantitative sensitivity test on one aspect of the PM-mortality dose-response function\\" is mentioned, it tells us that an analysis was performed, in this case, a quantitative sensitivity test. By conducting this test, the aim was primarily to evaluate the relationship between PM (particulate matter) and mortality. Sensitivity tests are valuable tools in research because they identify variations in data, specifically under different scenarios or assumptions. In this context, the test would have assessed the robustness of the dose-response relationship between PM and mortality. The sensitivity test outcomes would thus help researchers pinpoint underlying data, including probable consistencies or inconsistencies, and explore any uncertainties in the results. So, it follows that \\"The test that was conducted helped pinpoint data for the research.\\" As a result, the researchers can potentially improve the study's reliability, make better predictions, understand the overall effect of PM on mortality, and possibly inform future policy-making pertaining to air quality and public health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Air enters the nose or mouth and travels through the windpipe into the lungs - The lungs have a series of smaller and finer tubes and sacs - Air reaches the smallest and finest air sacs called alveoli - Oxygen travels from the alveoli into the blood - Oxygen-rich blood is carried to the heart - Oxygen-rich blood is pumped throughout the body by the heart - Cells take in the oxygen rich blood and release carbon dioxide rich blood - The carbon dioxide rich blood travels to the lungs - Carbon dioxide travels through the throat and is exhaled.  Question: suppose We are in a low altitude zone happens, how will it affect less oxygen will be produced.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: less When we are in a low-altitude zone, the atmospheric pressure is higher than at high altitudes. This means there is an increased amount of air pressure acting on our bodies, causing the air to become denser and contain more oxygen molecules per unit volume. To understand how this affects the oxygen production, let's revisit the process of breathing and gas exchange in the body. 1. Air enters the nose or mouth and travels through the windpipe into the lungs. When we inhale, air is pulled into the respiratory system via the nose and mouth, which filters, warms, and moistens it before it travels through the windpipe (trachea) and into the lungs. 2. The lungs have a series of smaller and finer tubes and sacs. Inside the lungs, the trachea further divides into two bronchi (bronchus for one lung), which subsequently branch into bronchioles. These smaller tubes spread throughout the lungs. 3. Air reaches the smallest and finest air sacs called alveoli. The bronchioles end in tiny grape-like air sacs called alveoli, where oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange occurs. The walls of alveoli are very thin, allowing for efficient gas exchange. 4. Oxygen travels from the alveoli into the blood. When the air reaches the alveoli, oxygen molecules (O2) from the air move across the thin membrane and into the bloodstream, binding to hemoglobin in red blood cells. 5. Oxygen-rich blood is carried to the heart. The blood with high oxygen levels (oxygen-rich blood) is then carried back to the heart via pulmonary veins. 6. Oxygen-rich blood is pumped throughout the body by the heart. The heart pumps the oxygenated blood to various tissues and organs throughout the body via arteries. 7. Cells take in the oxygen-rich blood and release carbon dioxide-rich blood. As the oxygen-rich blood reaches the body's cells, oxygen is released and taken up by the cells for use in energy production (cellular respiration), while carbon dioxide (CO2), a waste product, diffuses back into the bloodstream. 8. The carbon dioxide-rich blood travels to the lungs. The blood with high carbon dioxide levels (carbon dioxide-rich blood) returns to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries. 9. Carbon dioxide travels through the throat and is exhaled. As we exhale, the carbon dioxide diffuses across the thin alveoli membrane, moving from the bloodstream into the alveoli, and then is expelled from the body when we breathe out. In a low-altitude zone, the higher atmospheric pressure results in the air being denser and having more oxygen molecules per unit volume. This greater concentration of oxygen allows for more effective gas exchange in the alveoli, as the gradient or difference in oxygen levels between the air in the alveoli and the oxygen-poor blood entering the pulmonary capillaries is more significant. Consequently, the body gets more oxygen with each breath, and less oxygen needs to be produced by the cells to meet the body's demand for energy at low altitudes. In conclusion, being in a low-altitude zone affects the oxygen produced by the body—more specifically, it will lead to less oxygen being produced as the body can acquire more oxygen from the denser air, making it easier to meet the demand for oxygen in various cellular processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The panel was suggested by Sir Liam Donaldson in his 2015 report which said there were too many hospitals and expertise was too thinly spread. It highlighted duplication and called for a simpler, more efficient system. Sir Liam said the panel should be international and it should be agreed in advance to accept its proposals. However, Health Minister Simon Hamilton did not agree, saying the panel should be mostly local and there would be no upfront agreement to accept its findings. The panel announced on Thursday has two international figures and four more from Northern Ireland. It will be chaired by Prof Rafael Bengoa who is director of the health department at the Deusto Business School in Spain. He is regarded as a worldwide expert on health reform and has advised the European Union and the Obama administration. Prof Bengoa previously worked for the World Health Organisation for more than 15 years. He said that over the last 40 years, there had been a focus in health on \\"planning around structures instead of planning around patient needs and outcomes\\". \\"The important thing for us at the panel is to be thinking in outcome terms and then we see if there is any physical restructuring that is needed to fulfil those outcomes but not the other way around,\\" he added. \\"The difference Northern Ireland is suggesting is that they are engaging both politically and technically on the long-term and so other countries are not doing that and that is why I think it is interesting to accept this invitation to lead the panel.\\" Other panel members include two Northern Ireland-based doctors and two health service managers who are from Northern Ireland but now work in England. They are; In a statement, Mr Hamilton said: \\"We know that health and social care is facing significant challenges in the coming years. \\"Our population is increasing in size and is getting older. More people are living with chronic conditions, unhealthy lifestyles are creating more demand for services and new developments in medical technologies and drugs are increasing demand and raising costs. \\"We cannot afford to stand still. We have to transform our health and social care system to make sure we can continue to deliver world class services. \\"I am therefore appointing an expert panel to lead the debate on the optimal configuration of health and social care services in Northern Ireland.\\" Mr Hamilton wants cross-party consensus on the specific terms of reference for the panel. This is to be discussed a a political summit on health next month. The experts will then begin the main part of their work by mid-March. It is hoped the panel will report by the summer on specific changes to Northern Ireland's health system, but any substantial proposals are likely to  take years to implement.

What are some of the best examples of hypocrisy about feminism in India? What are some of the best examples of hypocrisy in India? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Options:  a). no;  b). yes;","output":"a). no; The two questions are not the same. The first question specifically refers to the examples of hypocrisy about feminism in India, while the second question is more general, asking about the examples of hypocrisy in India without specifying a particular context. Here are some detailed answers to both questions: 1. Examples of hypocrisy about feminism in India: a. Traditional gender roles: While advocating for women's rights and equality, many people in India still conform to traditional gender roles in their own lives. For example, a person might outwardly support women's right to work, but still expect women in their family to prioritize housework and childcare. b. Pay gap: Despite the persistent fight for equal pay, the gender pay gap is still a significant issue in India. Many companies and organizations may claim to support feminism and gender equality while continuing to pay female employees less than their male counterparts. c. Victim blaming: In cases of sexual assault and harassment, it is common to see discussions that shift the blame from the perpetrator to the victim. This is in direct contradiction to the feminist ideal of holding aggressors accountable for their actions. d. Selective support: Some people may claim to be feminist but only support certain aspects of the ideology that align with their personal beliefs or interests. This can be seen in cases where someone supports women in certain professions but does not advocate for the rights of women from different social backgrounds or marginalized communities. 2. Examples of general hypocrisy in India: a. Caste system: Though the Indian constitution abolished caste-based discrimination, it still persists in many parts of the society. People may claim to be against caste discrimination while participating in caste-based practices in their personal lives, such as marrying within their own caste or supporting caste-based reservations in education and jobs. b. Political corruption: Many politicians in India criticize corruption but may themselves be involved in corrupt practices, such as taking bribes, misusing public funds, or engaging in nepotism. c. Religious intolerance: India is a secular country, but instances of religious intolerance are prevalent. People from different religious backgrounds may preach peace and tolerance, yet involve themselves in communal violence or discriminate against individuals based on their religion. d. Environmental concerns: Many people in India express concerns about pollution and the environment yet continue to engage in environmentally harmful behaviors, such as littering, burning garbage, or using excessive plastic. In summary, the two questions are not the same, as one focuses on hypocrisy within the context of feminism in India, and the other encompasses a broader scope of hypocrisy in India in general. Although there may be some overlap in the issues mentioned, each question calls for a distinct set of examples and contexts."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The example of African slaves in the American South on the other hand demonstrates that slave populations can multiply.Xenophon advised that male and female slaves should be lodged separately, that \\"…nor children born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad.\\" The explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap, so it may have been cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one. Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.Houseborn slaves (oikogeneis) often constituted a privileged class. They were, for example, entrusted to take the children to school; they were \\"pedagogues\\" in the first sense of the term. Some of them were the offspring of the master of the house, but in most cities, notably Athens, a child inherited the status of its mother.  Guess a valid title for it!

But the regional Catalan government said there could be further arrests. A key suspect linked to the Barcelona attack and a later one is still sought. Thursday's attack in the Catalan capital saw a van driven at high speed along Las Ramblas where it smashed into dozens of people walking along the pedestrianised avenue popular with tourists and residents alike. Spanish police are searching for Moroccan-born Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, who they suspect may be the driver who escaped the scene on foot. Only hours later, early on Friday, there was a second van attack in Cambrils, west of Barcelona. A woman was killed and police shot dead five suspected attackers, including Moussa Oukabir, 17, originally reported as the key suspect in the Barcelona attack. Oukabir is suspected of using his brother's documents to rent the van used in Barcelona and another found hours later in the town of Vic, north of Barcelona, that was intended as a getaway vehicle. The terror cell is reported to comprise 12 men. The Catalan Interior Minster, Joaquim Forn, stressed that the police operation could not be considered over until all those suspected of being part of the cell were in custody. Police say the suspects had been planning more sophisticated attacks, but an explosion on Wednesday at a house in the town of Alcanar deprived them of bomb material, so they carried out simpler attacks using vehicles. Police have found the remains of at least three people at the Alcanar house, El Pais newspaper reports. Abouyaaqoub lived in the town of Ripoll to the north of Barcelona. Three people have been arrested in Ripoll, and one in Alcanar. In Ripoll the apartment of an imam was raided on Saturday. Another van, a Renault Kangoo, is also being sought, amid reports it may have been driven across the border into France. Security is being stepped up, though the security alert level is staying unchanged as there is no information suggesting an imminent attack. Special police controls were introduced at Saturday's two La Liga football matches in Barcelona and Girona. So-called Islamic State (IS) said it had carried out the Las Ramblas attack, though it is not clear whether any of the attackers were directly connected to the group or simply inspired by it. Five of the dead have been named so far: A 74-year-old Portuguese woman, a 40-year-old woman with dual Argentine and Spanish citizenship, and a Belgian were also killed, their governments said. The whereabouts of seven-year-old Julian Cadman, a dual British-Australian national apparently separated from his injured mother during the attack, remains unclear. He was widely reported to be missing. However, the Catalan police, responding to inquiries, tweeted that they had neither been looking for nor found any missing child. The victims and the injured had all been located, they said.

Write an article based on this summary: – In late July, human remains were found near Cap-des-Rosiers, Quebec—and archaeologists believe they may belong to people who died at sea in 1847. The story of the Carricks of Whitehaven layers tragedy upon tragedy: Passengers on the Irish ship were trying to escape the potato famine that was killing their countrymen, only to see their ship go down in a storm while en route to Quebec City. Of the nearly 200 people on the Carricks, at least 80 are believed to have died off the Gaspe coast. Parks Canada archaeologist Martin Perron says the remains, which look to belong to five adults and three kids, appear to have been quickly deposited in what the Canadian Press calls a \\"shallow trench\\"—and could potentially be a mass grave. Bones have been found in the same area before. The Globe and Mail's report on the initial May 2011 find there noted that historical accounts describe victims as being laid out on the beach before burial, but no specific location of the grave was reported. It quotes some historical writings: a magazine article from the time noting the ship \\"went to pieces in the course of two hours,\\" and a 1919 book on Gaspe that stated, \\"For a whole day two oxcarts carried the dead to deep trenches near the scene of the disaster.\\" A 2014 Mail article reported that the bones found in 2011 were determined to be those of three European children who experienced malnutrition—suggesting they were very likely Carricks victims.

The Carricks of Whitehaven, an Irish vessel, had been carrying nearly 200 passengers fleeing the devastating potato famine. Sadly, a storm caused the ship to sink while en route to Quebec City, and it is believed that at least 80 people perished off the Gaspe coast in the disaster. Last month, Parks Canada archaeologist Martin Perron and his team found the remains, which appear to belong to five adults and three children. The Canadian Press reported that the remains were deposited quickly in a shallow trench. This suggests the location might be a mass grave, as bones have been found in the area before. The Globe and Mail recounted the initial May 2011 find, mentioning historical accounts that described victims being laid out on the beach before burial.

Following this conclusion, Parks Canada will be using ground-penetrating radar in a search for additional remains. The tragic story of the Carricks of Whitehaven highlights the desperation of those seeking refuge from the deadly potato famine in Ireland. These newly discovered human remains add another layer of sorrow to an already heartbreaking tale.

I tried to pour the water into the bottle, but I couldn't do it because the","output":"stream of water from the faucet was too wide, and it ended up splashing all over the countertop.  Step 1: Assess the situation and identify the problem. I observed that the faucet's water flow was too strong, which was causing the water to splash instead of filling the bottle smoothly. The first step was to analyze the issue to find an efficient solution. Step 2: Reduce the water flow. To solve the problem, I decided to adjust the faucet handle, decreasing the water flow. By carefully turning the handle, I was able to find an appropriate flow rate to minimize splashing and fill up the water bottle without any unnecessary spillage. Step 3: Search for additional tools to assist. In case the reduced flow didn't solve the issue completely, I checked around the kitchen for a funnel or other tool that could help with guiding the water into the bottle more accurately. After finding a small funnel in one of the drawers, I kept it handy by placing it beside me near the sink. Step 4: Position the water bottle and funnel. To improve efficiency, I placed the funnel on the opening of the water bottle to make sure it was stable and secure. This would enhance the process by preventing the water from splashing out and by directing the flow straight into the bottle. Step 5: Fill the water bottle. Once I had set everything up, I slowly turned on the faucet and poured the water through the funnel into the water bottle. Thanks to the funnel and the reduced water flow, the water was now conveniently channeled into the bottle without any spillage. Step 6: Clean up any remaining water. Despite the improvements made to this process, some water had already splashed onto the countertop. I grabbed a kitchen towel and wiped up any remaining water to ensure the area was clean and dry, preventing any potential slipping hazards. Step 7: Put away the funnel and store the water bottle. After successfully filling up the water bottle, I removed the funnel and rinsed it off before putting it away in its designated spot. I then closed the lid on the water bottle and placed it back in the refrigerator for future use. By following these steps, I was able to overcome the initial issue of the water splashing everywhere and create a more efficient process for filling up the water bottle.

Both residents and activists described the clashes as \\"unprecedented\\", and said rebel fighters were attacking government positions on several fronts. The fighting had spread to previously peaceful districts, they added. On Thursday, the UN said the number of Syrians fleeing to other states could exceed 700,000 by the end of the year. More than half a million are believed to have already crossed into Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq, but only 294,000 have registered with the UN. UN agencies and other humanitarian groups have issued a funding appeal for 488m (Â£300m) to help them meet the needs of the refugees. Activists said the start of the rebel offensive in Aleppo was announced in calls from mosques at about 16:00 (13:00 GMT) on Thursday. In interviews with foreign media and videos posted online, members of the Tawhid Brigade said a \\"decisive\\" battle for control of the city had begun. The offensive involved hundreds of rebel fighters attacking government positions on several fronts, they added. \\"We wanted to surprise the Syrian army which had started to creep forward towards the southern neighbourhoods,\\" Bashir al-Haji, the Tawhid Brigade's commander, told the Guardian newspaper. \\"There are 6,000 fighters of the Tawhid Brigade taking part in the battle now, in addition to a few other brigades like al-Fatah and Ahfad al-Fatihin for the Turkmen.\\" He denied the FSA had declared \\"decisive\\" battles for Aleppo before. \\"We are not aiming to liberate the whole of Aleppo with this battle but to regain control of most of the city and get back as many neighbourhoods as we can.\\" The rebel claims could not be immediately verified, but activists and residents reported heavy clashes and shelling in the districts of Izaa, Saif al-Dawla, Salah al-Din, Amariya and Sukkari on Thursday night and Friday morning. \\"The fighting is unprecedented and has not stopped since Thursday,\\" said Rami Abdul Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based activist group, told AFP news agency. \\"The clashes used to be limited to one or two blocks of a district, but now the fighting is on several fronts.\\" But the BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says there is little sign so far that the rebels have made much progress. Syrian state media reported some unusual mortar fire onto south-eastern districts of the city which have so far been relatively untouched. Attacks by rebels had been repulsed in several places, and heavy losses had been inflicted by government forces, they said. For more than a month, the struggle for control of Aleppo has been at a stalemate, with government forces unable to dislodge the rebels, and the latter unable to take complete control, our correspondent adds. Meanwhile, several north-eastern and southern districts of Damascus which were supposedly recaptured by the army weeks ago saw further violence on Friday, with troops and militia moving back in. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 60 people, including 30 civilians, had been killed across the country on Friday.

Translate to English","output":"I would like to hear the Commission's position on the processing of hazardous bovine organs into gelatine and tallow. The European Commission takes the issue of food safety very seriously, and this concern extends to the production of by-products such as gelatine and tallow from bovine organs. To address the risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and other related diseases, the European Union has implemented comprehensive legislation governing the production of these substances from animal tissues. Specifically, the production of gelatine and tallow from hazardous bovine organs is strictly regulated to minimize the risk of contamination by prions, which cause BSE in cattle and its human form, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). European regulations aim to prevent the use of potentially contaminated animal tissues in the production of substances that may pose a risk to human or animal health. The primary legislation governing the production of these substances is Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, which lays down rules for the prevention, control, and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies like BSE. This regulation is further supported by Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009, which provides rules on animal by-products and derived products not intended for human consumption. Regarding the production of gelatine and tallow, there are several key rules and safety measures in place: 1. Sourcing of raw materials: Only tissues from animals that have undergone required veterinary checks and have been declared fit for human consumption may be used in the production of gelatine and tallow. The use of specified risk material (SRM), which is the tissue most likely to be contaminated with prions, is prohibited for both human and animal consumption and must be removed and disposed of safely. 2. Traceability: A traceability system is in place to ensure that all animal by-products and derived products can be traced back to their origin. This allows for faster identification and removal of potentially contaminated materials from the production chain. 3. Processing methods: Both gelatine and tallow production are subject to rigorous processing methods that effectively remove or inactivate prions, minimizing the risk of contamination. The processing methods for gelatine include acid or alkaline treatment, followed by extensive rinsing, and filtration. Tallow production requires heating at high temperatures and subsequent separation of the fat from the protein material. 4. Monitoring and inspection: Authorities are responsible for monitoring compliance with these regulations and carry out regular inspections of production facilities, ensuring that companies follow the required safety measures and procedures. 5. Disposal of waste materials: Any waste material, including those classified as SRM, must be disposed of in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 to prevent the spread of BSE and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In conclusion, the European Commission is deeply committed to ensuring the safety of both human and animal health. Strict regulations and safety measures govern the production of gelatine and tallow from bovine organs, and these measures aim to minimize the risk of contamination by BSE-causing prions. By adhering to these guidelines, the European Union can continue to maintain the highest level of food safety and protect public health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions.

She can be slightly aggressive and I'm starting to get worried and a bit annoyed. How do I stop her? ----Susan, London. Answer: You need to get this problem under control before it could escalate  . I always advise owners not to talk on the mobile phone when they go for a walk with their dogs, because they should be focusing on this time with their pets, but I know people have busy lives and need to make phone calls. The behavior she is showing is either controlling or playfulness, but they both result from the same issue ---- you are not paying attention to her. If you must make phone calls while on a walk, try to still engage with your dog by speaking towards her, playing some sorts of game and so on. If that doesn't work, you'll have to try more of a training approach. You will need a training line and some treats. Start your walk in the usual way, make a phone call, and when your dog starts displaying the undesired behavior, simply stop walking --- otherwise she will see it as a game. When she is calm and looking at you, or if she sits, give her a treat; then continue walking. If she starts up again, pick up the lead, gently pull it, and tell her \\"no\\".  Then ask her to sit and give her a treat if she does. The aim of this is to try to get her to forget how much fun it is biting your shoes. Do little sessions every day --- and try not to answer the phone if you know it's going to be a long conversation. Be patient and good luck! Remember that if an animal shows signs of distress or discomfort, an early visit to the vet is always recommended. Question: How can Susan get her pet dog to forget the fun from biting her shoes?

The answer is:","output":"The total resistance in a series circuit increases as more resistors are added in series. When twenty more resistors are added to the series circuit in series, the total resistance of the circuit is increased. In a series circuit, the resistors are connected end-to-end, so the current has to pass through each resistor in turn. The current flowing through the resistors is the same as the total current flowing through the circuit. The total resistance in this type of circuit is directly proportional to the total number of resistors connected in series, as well as their individual resistance values. To put it mathematically, the total resistance in a series circuit (R_total) is equal to the sum of resistances of each resistor connected in series: R_total = R1 + R2 + R3 + ... + Rn Where R1, R2, R3, ... Rn are the individual resistance values of the resistors connected in series. As we add more resistors to the series circuit in series, the value of R_total increases accordingly. In our example, by adding twenty more resistors to the series circuit, the total resistance of the circuit is increased because we are adding more resistors and their resistance values to the overall sum. This increased resistance will cause the overall current flowing through the circuit to decrease due to Ohm's Law (V = IR), where V is the voltage across the circuit, I is the current flowing through it, and R is the total resistance. In conclusion, by adding twenty more resistors to the series circuit in series, the total resistance of the circuit is increased. This results in a decrease in the overall current flowing through the circuit, as the added resistance makes it more difficult for the current to flow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Congressional budget welcomes big bank bailouts once more despite White House opposition Congress has agreed to use federal deposit insurance, which was designed to protect the savings accounts of consumers, to cover risky trading by the nation’s biggest banks. In a small provision in the budget bill, Congress agreed to allow banks to house their trading of swaps and derivatives alongside customer deposits, which are insured by the federal government against losses. The budget move repeals a portion of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act and, some say, lays the groundwork for future bailouts of banks who make irresponsibly risky trades. “It’s both a stealth move and indefensible,” said Dennis Kelleher, the head of Better Markets, a group that argues for great oversight of banks. In a note to clients, he later called it “a sneaky, midnight repeal”. The White House said on Wednesday it “strongly opposes” the provision. “The main purpose...is to reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program; this bill should not be used as a vehicle to add entirely unrelated financial regulatory provisions,” the White House said. “If Wall Street gets the upside in big bonuses from its high-risk derivatives deals, then it should also have to pay the downside for any losses,” Kelleher wrote. Richard Trumka, the head of labor union AFL-CIO, said his organizations also objected to the budget provision. “Dodd-Frank forced too-big-to-fail banks to move potentially toxic speculation in derivatives out of their government-insured banks,” Trumka said in a statement. “Wall Street’s friends in Congress are trying to once again put the public on the hook for the most dangerous aspects of the financial system.” Banks make their money primarily through two activities: lending out deposits to people or companies, and speculating on the markets. Laws like the defunct Glass-Steagall act were designed to separate the two activities. The Dodd-Frank rule recaptured a small part of that separation. The budget provision, however, retracts the rule, which has been a thorn in the paw of giant banks like JP Morgan and Citigroup. That rule, passed in 2010 and called the “swaps pushout rule”, dictated that banks had to keep certain arcane, risk-taking businesses away from customer deposits: swaps in stocks, commodities, and similar businesses. Other derivatives, however, could still sit in the section of the banks protected by government backing. The derivatives business is a lucrative and concentrated one: 95% of the trading in derivatives in the US are done by the five biggest banks, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan. The banks have made more money in derivatives because they have government backing for deposits, Kelleher said. That’s no longer in place. “The swaps pushout provision was saying US taxpayers should not be paying for risky trading activities,” said Kelleher. Customer deposits – including the savings accounts of most Americans – are heavily regulated in size and scope by the federal government. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides a guarantee that, even if a bank goes under, customers can’t lose all of their money. The FDIC was created in response to worries about “runs on the bank” in the 1920s and 1930s as stock market speculation, then the Great Depression, caused financial panic and destabilized the financial system. Lobbyists for banks including Citigroup had previously tried to rewrite the provision, drafting as many as 70 of the 85 lines in one 2012 update. The budget provision is a success for lobbyists and the banks they work for, but a loss to Americans who will have to foot the bill again if banks take too much risk, said Kelleher. Derivatives, particularly in mortgages, were at the center of the 2008 financial crisis as insurers like AIG nearly collapsed under the weight of their risk. Excess exposure to derivatives created a restructuring of the financial system as investment banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers went out of business due to fear over their financial exposure. Others fared better, but went through intense fear in the fall of 2008: Merrill Lynch had to be sold to Bank of America to survive, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had to forge new identities as commercial banks, which allowed the Fed to protect them. The new budget provision once again acts as a promise that taxpayers will foot the bill for risky trading and speculation, Kelleher said. “If things go wrong, [the banks] get to run to the Fed for bailouts. That’s incredibly valuable to them,” he said. The surprise in the budget move is that everyone but banks considered the matter already settled. The Dodd-Frank rule dictated that banks would have to find new homes for their risk-taking unit to prevent them from taking risks with customer deposits. Even so, mistakes occurred. A notable example of a bank making a spectacular failing bet with customer money came in 2012, when JP Morgan used its 350bn chief investment office to make the infamous ‘London Whale’ trade, which led the bank to lose at least 6bn and led to a round of congressional hearings. JP Morgan increased its risk so much on the initial trade that the trader who initiated the bet called it “idiotic”. Swaps and derivatives are financial instruments that allow speculators to make bets on the future prices of stocks, bonds and commodities. Banks and companies also use these swaps and derivatives to hedge against price rises in corn, oil, and other commodities they use regularly; airlines, for instance, regularly use derivatives to hedge the price of fuel, and McDonald’s, among others, has hedges on the price of corn. Since the passage of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill in 2009, banks and their lobbyists have not given up hope in pushing back regulation. “Since the beginning of the financial crisis, the political world has buffeted the financial services sector with waves of new regulation in an attempt to punish the wicked and to make sure a similar crisis ‘never happens again’,” wrote Brian Gardner, Washington analyst for Keefe Bruyette & Woods. Gardner said such efforts have been met with resistance from the financial services industry: “Ever since the law was passed in 2010, industry and observers (us included) have been waiting for a ‘technical corrections’ bill to fix mistakes in the law,” Gardner, however, estimated the chances of that happening at under 60% due to “populism” that still exists in Congress, putting the largest banks “in the political doghouse”, he wrote. “We think Senate Republicans will be wary about being seen as too close to Wall Street, and will avoid making changes to Dodd-Frank that may expose them to attacks.” But Gardner echoed the hopes of many in the financial industry that yet more of Dodd-Frank’s reforms could be pulled back: “With the major pieces of the Dodd-Frank Act mostly in place and with a change in control of the Senate, we think 2015 offers the sector the first legitimate prospect for policymakers to review some of the new regulatory landscape and see what works and what they got wrong.” What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Congress has agreed to use federal deposit insurance to cover risky trading by the nation's biggest banks. This means that they will allow banks to house their trading of swaps and derivatives alongside customer deposits, which are insured by the federal government against losses. Some people say this could lead to future bailouts of banks who make risky trades. The White House is not happy about this decision, and they \\"strongly oppose\\" the provision. This could be a success for bank lobbyists, but might not be good for Americans, as they may have to help pay if banks take too many risks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Presence of a \\"third man\\": The statement clearly refers to a \\"third man,\\" which inherently implies the existence of a first and second man as well. The mere mention of the third man's presence confirms that at least three individuals are involved in the scene. 2. Men's positions: The premise states that the third man is standing \\"behind the bar,\\" indicating that he is likely an employee or otherwise involved in the workings of the bar. This is further supported by his task of \\"polishing thick glasses,\\" an activity typically associated with bartenders or other bar staff. The first and second men's positions are not provided, but the fact that they are mentioned suggests that they are distinguishable from the third man. However, we cannot determine whether they are patrons, employees, or related to the bar in any other capacity. 3. Location: From the premise, it is established that the scene takes place in a bar. The third man is explicitly mentioned to be located behind the bar, and while the positions of the first and second men are not specified, they are implied to be within the same location. Taking these points into consideration, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"There were at least three men in the bar\\" holds true. The premise confirms the presence of a third man in addition to the implied first and second men, and states that they are all within the same location—the bar.

We have the equation: 0 * a + 10 = 2 * a Let's break it down step by step: 1. First, we have something called 0 times a (0 * a). We know that anything multiplied by zero is zero. So, 0 * a is...? That's right, zero! So now our equation looks like this: 0 + 10 = 2 * a 2. Next, we have 0 + 10. When we add zero to any number, nothing changes. So, 0 + 10 is...? Good job! It's 10! Now our equation is: 10 = 2 * a 3. Our last step is to find out what a is. Right now, we have 10 = 2 * a. We need to get a by itself. Since 2 is multiplying a, we should do the opposite and divide. We need to divide both sides by 2. So, 10 divided by 2 is...? Brilliant! It's 5! So now, our equation is a = 5. And there we have it!
