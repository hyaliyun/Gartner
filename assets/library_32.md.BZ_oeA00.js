Answer:","output":"Ludwig Wenz was a German footballer who was born on August 24, 1906. He achieved notable success and recognition in his career, primarily playing as a goalkeeper. Despite facing many challenges throughout his life, Wenz's achievements on and off the field leave a lasting legacy and impact on the world of football. Wenz's passion for football began at a young age, and over time, he honed his skills, particularly in the goalkeeping position. His talent and determination led him to be part of Germany's national football team. He played for his national team during the 1930s, a time when the world was facing significant changes, and international sports competitions served as a platform for countries to showcase their athletic prowess. Ludwig Wenz had the honor of wearing the national colors for Germany during the early stages of his career. He made his debut for the national team in 1930, earning his first and only national cap. A national cap refers to an appearance made by a player for their national team in an official match. This achievement was a testament to Wenz's exceptional skills as a goalkeeper and a source of pride for both him and his country. As a goalkeeper, Wenz's primary role was to prevent the opposing team from scoring goals. Throughout his international career, he did not score any goals. This is not unusual for goalkeepers, as their main focus is on defending their team's goal rather than scoring.  Apart from his achievements on the field, Ludwig Wenz's life was marked by personal milestones. He was born in the early 20th century, a time of rapid industrialization and social change. Throughout his life, he witnessed numerous historical events that shaped the world, such as the Great Depression, World War II, and the beginnings of the Cold War. Wenz’s football career spanned several years, playing in various clubs and his valuable contribution to German football was not limited to his time with the national team. His dedication and commitment helped to lay the groundwork for the future successes of German goalkeepers. Sadly, Ludwig Wenz passed away on April 18, 1968. Despite his death, his legacy continues to serve as an inspiration to aspiring goalkeepers and football enthusiasts in Germany and around the world. His time with the national team may have been brief, but it serves as an essential chapter in the biography of this remarkable goalkeeper, whose name will be remembered in the annals of German football history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Interested in Police Shootings? Add Police Shootings as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Police Shootings news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest      Eight guns were stolen from Cash America Pawn Saturday before 2 a.m., police said. Of the four suspects who were involved in the burglary, three have been taken into custody. One suspect told police he was looking for bullets to harm police officers in the Baton Rouge Area, said Baton Rouge Police Chief Dabadie, Jr.      Police said they consider the threats credible.      Six of the firearms, which were all handguns, have been recovered. A BB gun was also stolen from the store.      One of the suspects was apprehended while fleeing on foot. A 17-year-old was apprehended on the scene in possession of one handgun and one airsoft BB gun. During questioning, he informed police that he and the three other suspects stole the firearms and were going to get bullets to shoot police. He was booked into parish prison for simple burglary and theft of a firearm, police said.      One of the suspects involved in the burglary was a 13-year-old, who was charged with simple burglary and theft of a firearm, police said. Another suspect, 20-year-old Malik Bridgewater, was arrested Sunday at his home and charged with burglary and theft of a firearm. Police recovered three of the stolen handguns from him.      Police are asking that the fourth suspect, who is still at large, turn himself in. His identity is unknown.      Surveillance video shows the suspects using a ladder to climb to the roof of the building, where they made entry into the store, police said.      Investigators recovered two of the stolen handguns from 23-year-old Trashone Coats, who allegedly purchased them illegally on the street, police said. He was charged with illegal possession of a stolen firearm.      The owner of the pawn shop told police it doesn't appear that any ammunition was taken from the pawn shop.      Several law enforcement agencies are investigating the threat, including Louisiana State Police, the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office and the ATF.      Police said they increased their presence in the city following the shooting death of Alton Sterling last week due to the \\"very real and viable threats to law enforcement\\" in the area. The aggressive police response, which showed police in riot gear clearing crowds, was also due in part to the information obtained after the burglary, said East Baton Rouge Sheriff Sid Gatreaux.      The investigation is ongoing. ||||| Law enforcement officials in Baton Rouge say four suspects broke into a local pawn shop and stole guns with the intent to attack police officers, just days after the officer-involved shooting of Alton Sterling.      Police said the burglary occurred Saturday (July 9) at the Cash America Pawn Store on 3347 Government St. One of the suspects was arrested on or near the scene of the burglary with a handgun, a second suspect was arrested after the burglary on Saturday, and a third, a 13-year-old boy, was arrested Monday.      In a statement, police said surveillance video showed the suspects using a ladder to climb the roof of the building to get in early Saturday.      Police recovered six handguns from the three suspects, as well as a BB gun pistol. Another two handguns are still on the street, and police are concerned that they remain with the fourth person, who remains at large.      Police said they still have not identified the fourth person. Two of the people arrested were identified as Antonio Thomas, 17 and Malik Bridgewater, 20. The 13-year-old was not identified. Thomas was arrested on the scene of the burglary; Bridgewater was arrested Sunday at his home at 2050 Hemlock St.      Bridgewater and Thomas were held on charges of simple burglary and theft of a firearm.      The plot was uncovered four days after Sterling was shot July 5 as two police officers pinned him to the ground. Sterling's death ignited protests in cities across the nation, leading to dozens of arrests in Baton Rouge. At a July 7 protest in Dallas, a man who told police he was targeting white people shot and killed five officers.      State Police Superintendent Mike Edmonson said the information developed since the burglary in Baton Rouge on Saturday revealed \\"an actual, credible threat\\" against police. Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr. said police responding to the protests were dressed in riot gear and armed with automatic weapons because they were concerned some people in the crowd might be armed with the intent to harm police officers.      \\"The statement was to get bullets to harm police officers in the Baton Rouge area,\\" Dabadie said in reference to what he said were assertions from the person captured after the pawn shop burglary. \\"We have been questioned repeatedly over the last several days about our show of force and why we have the tactics we have. Well, this is the reason. We had credible threats to the lives of law enforcement in this city.\\"      Officials said police were able to get information about the plot from the first person arrested. That person said three other people were involved and that they were looking for guns and ammunition to target police officers, authorities said.      Officials said they consider the threat still active, noting one of the suspects remained at large and two of the stolen weapons have not been recovered.      Dabadie pleaded with the fourth person to come forward.      \\"We ask that suspect, you know who you are, please turn yourself in,\\" Dabadie said. \\"Please come on in, You won't be harmed. ... that way we can recover the rest of the firearms that were taken in this case.\\"      East Baton Rouge Sheriff Sid Gautreaux said police decided not to disclose the information about the threats against law enforcement when concerns were raised about whether police tactics were heavy-handed. Gautreaux said police did not want to disrupt the investigation, and the arrests were only disclosed after information began to leak in local news reports.      \\"What you saw in the response is because of the very real, viable threats against law enforcement,\\" Gautreaux said. \\"Look what happened in Dallas. A very peaceful protest. And then some crazy madman did what he did. We can't take anything for granted anymore.\\"      Edmonson said one other credible threat against police has been identified outside of the pawn shop burglary. He said police were investigating whether a police officer was being followed by a suspicious person.      Police said there was no indication of when or where an attack against police might take place.      A fourth person was also in police custody but was not involved in the plot against police. Police said Trashone Coats, 23, was found in possession of two of the eight handguns and had purchased them illegally on the street. He was charged with illegal possession of a stolen firearm.      CORRECTION: Authorities initially provided an incorrect photo of Antonio Thomas. The photo has been updated.      . . . . . .            The Associated Press contributed to this story. ||||| Summary:","output":"A pawn shop burglary in Baton Rouge is suspected to be part of a greater conspiracy to attack local police officers, following the shooting of Alton Sterling.

After the ferry moves off, Allen looks back at the girl, who dives underwater showing her mermaid's tail. Allen comes to believe the encounter was a near-death hallucination, but his bond with the mermaid proves so strong that his subsequent relationships with women fail as he seeks the connection he felt with the mermaid. Years later, Allen (Tom Hanks) is a co-owner of a wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New York City with his womanizing older brother Freddie (John Candy). Depressed after his latest breakup, Allen returns to Cape Cod, where he encounters eccentric scientist Dr. Walter Kornbluth (Eugene Levy). After Allen is left alone when his motorboat conks out, he again falls into the sea, and is knocked out when the boat hits his head. He wakes up with a headache on a beach, where he encounters a beautiful naked woman with long blonde hair, a necklace with a lion medal, and the inability to talk (Daryl Hannah) who, unknown to him, is the mermaid he met as a boy (her tail transforms into legs when it becomes dry). After kissing him, she dives into the sea and leaves Allen to return home. Kornbluth, while diving in order to seek proof of strange sea creatures, also encounters the mermaid in her sea form, causing him to become obsessed with finding her again. The mermaid finds Allen's wallet in the water and goes... A:","output":"The name she chooses for herself is Madison."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Kayla  didn't get a scholarship.  2). Rebecca  didn't get a scholarship.","output":"2) Rebecca didn't get a scholarship. The dichotomy between Kayla and Rebecca's attitudes toward school was as stark as night and day. Kayla, the more academically inclined of the two, consistently brought home top marks. She diligently studied and submitted assignments on time, always giving her best in each test and project. Her love for learning encompassed a gamut of subjects. Whether it was the complex equations in calculus, the intricate workings of cellular structures in biochemistry, or the fascinating mysteries of the universe in physics, she approached each subject with a zeal that was infectious to others. She had emerged as one of the highest achievers in her batch, a feat she accomplished through sheer hard work, discipline, and an unwavering commitment to her studies. Despite faced with grueling hours of studying and numerous assignment deadlines, Kayla persisted. She was determined to get into a well-reputed university, her dream not merely a college degree, but also a scholarship that tested her merit and recognized her efforts. She yearned ardently for an acknowledgement that symbolized her relentless endeavors, and a scholarship was everything she dreamt of. On the other hand, Rebecca had quite contrasting views on her education. She didn't really care for school. Not that she lacked intellect or capacity; it was more about differing priorities and a different view of her life path. Rebecca had a level of creativity that often conflicted with the linear thinking that was fostered in a traditional academic setting. She had a knack for arts and music, and found joy in writing and exploring the outdoors. To her, school was a chore, something that bridged her world from childhood to adulthood and nothing more. The standard school curriculum often stymied her innovative mindset, and as a result, she didn't perform as well academically. When it came down to scholarships, the final results didn't surprise anyone. Rebecca didn't get a scholarship. Although she was talented in her unique way, her non-academic inclinations and lack of interest in traditional scholastic pursuits reflected in her grades and school activities. Consequently, she didn't meet the standard academic criteria required for scholarship eligibility. As for Kayla, her high-flying grades combined with her impressive list of extracurricular accomplishments made her a perfect candidate, and she was duly rewarded with the precious scholarship she had been striving for. These divergent paths of Kayla and Rebecca only emphasized that while good grades and academic achievements were important for certain ambitions, they shouldn't be the absolute measures of success. Everyone, like Rebecca, should be allowed to follow their own passion and talent, and be appreciated for their unique abilities. It didn't mean that Rebecca was a failure, or that Kayla's achievements were superior – it simply underlined the idea that success can look different for everyone."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

How do I cite a primary historical source when taken from a website? How far down do pile drivers go for very tall buildings? OPT: + no; + yes; The answer is:","output":"no. The two questions you asked are entirely different and pertain to distinct subjects. The first question, \\"How do I cite a primary historical source when taken from a website?\\" pertains to properly citing an online primary historical source in academic writing or research. Primary historical sources are documents, artifacts, or other materials that were created at the time being studied or by someone who was present during that time. When citing these sources, you must follow guidelines set forth by citation formats such as APA, MLA, or Chicago, which typically include the author's name, the title of the document, the website's name, the publication date, and the URL. The second question, \\"How far down do pile drivers go for very tall buildings?\\" deals with the construction and foundation work of tall buildings. Pile drivers are machines used to drive piles, usually made of steel or concrete, into the ground to create deep foundations for structures. The depth that pile drivers go depends on various factors such as the building's height, weight, and the ground's soil and geological characteristics. In the case of very tall buildings, piles usually need to be driven down tens or even hundreds of feet to provide adequate support and stability. The specific depth would be determined by the building's engineering team after conducting thorough geotechnical studies and analysis. In conclusion, the two questions address completely different topics and are not the same. The first question focuses on proper citation for online primary historical sources, while the second question is related to the depth of pile drivers in the construction of tall buildings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Unfortunately, the","output":"owner was not interested in her watch and instead offered her a significantly lower price than expected. Sally had inherited the antique watch from her grandmother, who had received it as a gift during her travels across Europe in the early 1900s. The watch featured intricate gold engravings and delicate hand-painted dials, making it a unique and aesthetically striking timepiece. Disappointed but undeterred, Sally had carried out extensive research and consulted various experts, appraising the watch at a much higher value than what the owner of the pawn shop was willing to offer. The tapestry she had set her eyes on was a beautiful piece from the 18th century, depicting lush landscapes and finely woven narrative details that Sally had hoped to hang in her study as a focal point for conversation and wonder. Unfortunately, the owner of the pawn shop, Mr. Thompson, had a penchant for underestimating the value of valuable antiques and overpricing some of their less desirable items. He believed that the watch was not as rare or valuable as Sally claimed, and he proceeded to point out the level of damage incurred by the watch due to its age, such as the scratches on the glass and the slight fading of the numerals. Mr. Thompson also claimed that there was an overabundance of similar watches within the antiques market, making Sally's watch less appealing to potential collectors and, therefore, less valuable than she had previously believed. Sally didn't back down from her stance, as she was aware of the antique watch's true value, and she knew that Mr. Thompson was trying to take advantage of her desperation to acquire the tapestry. She emphasized that she had received professional appraisals and that the watch had historical and sentimental significance, making it a worthwhile exchange for the tapestry she desired. Regrettably, Mr. Thompson remained resolute in his decision not to offer a fair trade or accept the watch for its actual value. He insisted that if Sally wanted the tapestry, she would have to settle for the offer he provided, which was well below what she believed to be a fair exchange. Frustrated and disheartened by Mr. Thompson's refusal to negotiate, Sally left the pawn shop with a greater determination to find a location where her antique watch would be properly valued and appreciated. She also realized that it was essential to explore different options, such as online marketplaces and specialty antique shops, in order to find the tapestry she desired at a more reasonable price. In the end, Sally's experience at the pawn shop taught her that not all venues offer fair evaluations or deals for precious antiques. She also discovered that it is essential to trust her instincts and not be swayed by unscrupulous individuals who may seek to take advantage of those who are passionate about their collections. Despite the setback, Sally remained hopeful that she would soon find a way to trade her antique watch for a marvelous tapestry that would be admired and cherished for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Title: Disappointing Experience with AcDisplay App Review: I am extremely disappointed with the AcDisplay app (com.achep.acdisplay). I had high hopes, expecting this application to simplify my phone's lock screen and notification handling. However, after using it for a week, I can no longer tolerate its various shortcomings and have decided to give it a 1-star review. First and foremost, the app suffers from a plethora of stability and performance issues. It frequently crashes, causing me to waste valuable time trying to restart it, only for the app to inevitably crash again. The few times it manages to stay open, the interface is unresponsive and sluggish, often taking multiple taps to execute a single action. The customization options were insufficient and frequently glitchy. The app claims to offer a wide variety of themes and configurations, but the selection is underwhelming, and the customization options are poorly implemented. Several times I attempted to adjust the settings to enhance my experience, only to encounter errors and find my preferences reset to default upon rebooting the app. I was particularly frustrated with the notification handling feature of AcDisplay. Despite the app's apparent focus on streamlining notifications, it actually complicated the process for me. Notifications either didn't display at all or would appear and then suddenly disappear before I could view them. This eventually led me to miss some crucial messages and calls, resulting in negative repercussions in both my work and personal life. Moreover, battery drainage was a significant issue I encountered while using AcDisplay. The app consumed an unusually large amount of power, even when not in active use. I noticed a drastic decrease in my phone's battery life since installing this app, often requiring me to recharge multiple times a day. This is certainly not an efficient or practical long-term solution, especially for people who rely on their devices heavily throughout the day. Lastly, the lack of customer support was the final straw. When I encountered multiple issues with the app, I searched for ways to resolve them and reached out to the developer's support team, only to receive no response at all. With a seemingly non-existent customer service system in place, this app fell short in addressing users' concerns and issues. In summary, the AcDisplay app has been a severely negative experience for me, marred by performance issues, lackluster customization options, failed notification handling, excessive battery drainage, and all but absent customer support. I strongly discourage other potential users from downloading this app and advise that they seek out alternative solutions for a more satisfactory and beneficial experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It also said that Boali was in the northeast of the country. It is in the west. We apologise for these errors. Boali, Central African Republic -Â Robert KolofioÂ was finally able to bury his younger brother Konoumon MauriceÂ in February, more than a year after he disappeared. His family says Maurice, along with 11 others, was executed by soldiers from Congo Brazzaville who were part ofÂ an African Union peacekeeping force. As he seeks justice, Kolofio looks after Maurice's six children. \\"We've been meeting human rights people. My concern is that justice is done,\\" he said. \\"He's left me with children, I don't have a job, I can't take care of them and I don't even have the power to follow up on his death.\\" MauriceÂ was an area leader of anti-balaka, a Christian rebel group which has been one of the groups fighting a sectarian war in the Central African Republic. People in Boali, the western town where MauriceÂ was from, say he had kept the peace but an altercation with a Congolese AU commander could have led to his death. Most of the graves alongside MauriceÂ are marked unknown because identifying the highly decomposed bodies was difficult. Among the bodies was a pregnant women. \\"What I saw was just skull and bones.

Write a title for this article: There’s a big difference between annoying calls and outright scams. Telemarketing rules limit the kind of phone calls consumers can receive, but scam calls ignore those restrictions. Calls with prerecorded messages made by computerized dialing devices, commonly known as robocalls, are forbidden with just a few exceptions. (Unfortunately, calls from politicians are one of those exceptions.) So when you get a robocall, often from a generic-sounding company such as “Cardholder Services,” it’s probably a scam. Typically, the recording tries to convince you that you can lower the interest rate on your credit card or extend your auto warranty, enticing you to get on the line with a real person. Ultimately, they want you to pay them money for a worthless offer. Lately, though, more people are complaining about an increase of these calls, which pretend to be from government agencies and utilities. A reader recently wrote in about calls from the Internal Revenue Service threatening arrest if he didn’t pay money he supposedly owed. The IRS might not be a beloved agency, but that sort of call is not part of its repertoire. The scam tries to coax a frightened recipient of the call to send money to avoid arrest. Similarly, National Grid and other utilities are warning about calls instructing consumers to provide bank account information over the phone immediately or have their electricity or gas shut off. While utilities make reminder calls (sometimes using prerecorded messages) noting that failure to pay a bill could result in utilities getting turned off, the legitimate calls won’t demand financial information. The easiest way to verify the legitimacy of such a call is to contact the utility directly at the phone number on the bill, not the one the caller gives. The Do Not Call list can help with legitimate telemarketers, but it doesn’t help with scams. Consumers can report the calls to the Federal Trade Commission using the agency’s online form, but that doesn’t mean the calls will stop. So be on guard for this latest round of scam calls, and do not give out personal or financial information on any call you don’t initiate.","output":"Unmasking Robocalls: Deciphering Annoying Telemarketing from Dangerous Scams"},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand.

The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps.

The SOIUSA classification system divides them into the Western and Eastern Rhaetian Alps, while the Alpine Club classification of the Eastern Alps places most of the Rhaetion subranges within the Western Limestone Alps. They are located along the ItalianSwiss and AustrianSwiss borders, in the canton of Graubünden in eastern Switzerland; in the state of Tyrol in Austria; and in the Italian regions of Trentino-Alto Adige and Lombardy.  - Liechtenstein , officially the Principality of Liechtenstein, is a doubly landlocked German-speaking microstate in Central Europe. It is a constitutional monarchy with the rank of principality, headed by the Prince of Liechtenstein.  - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The Landwasser (German, lit.: \\"water of/for the land\\") is a river in Switzerland, canton of Graubünden. Its origin was Lake Davos before this was turned into a reservoir for a power station. Nowadays it is prolonged by the creek Flüelabach at its source and changes its name near Davos Dorf. Davos is the largest town and except for the last bit the only larger settlement on the river. Landwasser empties into the Albula below Filisur.  - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on.

HEAVE HALF A BRICK AT HIM   \\"For strangers then did so increase, By reason of King Henry's queen, And privileged in many a place To dwell, as was in London seen. Poor tradesmen had small dealing then And who but strangers bore the bell, Which was a grief to Englishmen To see them here in London dwell.\\"  Ill May Day, by CHURCHILL, a Contemporary Poet.  Time passed on, and Edmund Burgess, who had been sent from York to learn the perfection of his craft, completed his term and returned to his home, much regretted in the Dragon court, where his good humour and good sense had generally kept the peace, both within and without.  Giles Headley was now the eldest prentice. He was in every way greatly improved, thoroughly accepting his position, and showing himself quite ready both to learn and to work; but he had not the will or the power of avoiding disputes with outsiders, or turning them aside with a merry jest; and rivalries and quarrels with the armoury at the Eagle began to increase. The Dragon, no doubt, turned out finer workmanship, and this the Eagle alleged was wholly owing to nefarious traffic with the old Spanish or Moorish sorcerer in Warwick Inner Yard, a thing unworthy of honest Englishmen. This made Giles furious, and the cry never failed to end in a fight, in which Stephen supported the cause of the one house, and George Bates and his comrades of the other.  It was the same with even the archery at Mile End, where the butts were erected, and the youth contended with the long bow, which was still considered as the safeguard of England. King Henry often looked in on these matches, and did honour to the winners. One match there was in especial, on Mothering Sunday, when the champions of each guild shot against one another at such a range that it needed a keen eye to see the popinjay--a stuffed bird at which they shot.  Answer this series of questions: 1. Who would be returning home? 2. Who was not happy about this? 3. Who sent him to hone his craft? 4. Who sent Burgess to hone his craft?

Plot title: Jurassic Park Movie plot: The story begins on Isla Nublar, a small island 120 miles off the coast of Costa Rica. A large group of construction workers and animal handlers offload a large container, the creature within unseen. During the process, the animal attempts to escape, an act which leads to a mass panic, and the death of one of the workers.The story jumps forward to an Amber mine in the Dominican Republic, where we learn that miners extracting amber are involved with a genetic-engineering company called InGen. We also learn that the death of the worker seen earlier has raised serious concerns about the safety of the island, according to Donald Gennaro, an InGen representative, and that the owner of the island is now seeking top scientific experts in the field to help endorse the park.At a paleontological excavation in Montana we are introduced to Dr. Alan Grant, and his assistant Ellie Sattler, as they slowly uncover the fossilized remains of a Velociraptor, perhaps nature's most lethal and cunning predator to date, a beautiful specimen evolved to kill.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: I can use this background: A wood-decay fungus is any species of fungus that digests moist wood, causing it to rot. Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3]  Now, I have a new situation: The mycologist wanted to move to a rural area, to further his research, and found these two villages situated 10 miles from each other. The interesting fact about these villages was that while both villages had a forest nearby, one presented more signs of water saturation than the other, so that the rate of decay in wood was greater in Peak Forest. More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest.  Answer this question please: Which forest will have more wood-decay fungi? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Peak Forest will have more wood-decay fungi. The reason for this is the higher level of water saturation in Peak Forest compared to Valley Forest. Wood-decay fungi require excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood to colonize and proliferate. Even though both forests receive a similar amount of rainfall, the presence of a drainage system in Valley Forest, consisting of ditches dug by the locals, reduces the water saturation, which in turn reduces the rate of wood decay and the growth of wood-decay fungi. In contrast, the higher rate of wood decay in Peak Forest indicates more favorable conditions for wood-decay fungi, which leads to a higher presence of these fungi in that area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context:  The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\"  Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...  Guess a valid title for it!

At nightfall, a German man in a dentist cart pulls up and hails the Speck brothers. He introduces himself as Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz).Schultz is clearly more intelligent and enlightened than the Specks. He says he is looking for a slave who can identify a band of wanted fugitives known as the Brittle brothers. Django announces that he knows the Brittle brothers and can identify them. Schultz offers to buy Django, but his polite and educated manner rubs the ill-mannered Specks the wrong way, and Ace Speck threatens to shoot him with his shotgun. In response, Schultz lowers his lantern, whips out a revolver, and shoots Ace, then Dicky's horse, causing Dicky to fall off his horse. The horse carcass then lands on and crushes Dicky's leg, leaving him screaming in pain. Crippled, he agrees to sell Django, and Schultz pays the man (for both Django, and the dead Speck's horse), gets an official title to Django, and prepares to ride off.Before Schultz leaves, however, he frees the remaining slaves (clearly, Schultz finds slavery abhorrent) and says that they may either carry the remaining Speck brother back to town, or shoot him and flee.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Wang Mang (c. 45  6 October 23 AD), courtesy name Jujun (), was a Han Dynasty official who seized the throne from the Liu family and founded the Xin (or Hsin, meaning \\"renewed\\") Dynasty (), ruling 923 AD. The Han dynasty was restored after his overthrow, and his rule marks the separation between the Western Han Dynasty (before Xin) and Eastern Han Dynasty (after Xin). Some historians have traditionally viewed Wang as a usurper, while others have portrayed him as a visionary and selfless social reformer. Though a learned Confucian scholar who sought to implement the harmonious society he saw in the classics, his efforts ended in chaos.  - Han Xuan was a minor warlord and the Administrator (  ) of Changsha (  ) commandery during the late Han Dynasty . He served under Liu Biao , governor of Jing Province , for three years . After Liu Biao 's death , the northern part of Jing Province was divided between two of Liu Biao 's sons , Liu Qi and Liu Cong . The southern portion was divided between four Administrators , Zhao Fan , Jin Xuan , Liu Du and Han Xuan . Eventually , Changsha became an independent region under Han Xuan , and his land remained undisturbed by the other warlords for two years . Then in 210 , Liu Bei invaded Jing Province , capturing all the lands from their leaders .  - The Han dynasty was the second imperial dynasty of China (206 BC220 AD), preceded by the Qin dynasty (221206 BC) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history. To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \\"Han people\\" and the Chinese script is referred to as \\"Han characters\\". It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang, known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han, and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (923 AD) of the former regent Wang Mang. This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods: the Western Han or Former Han (206 BC  9 AD) and the Eastern Han or Later Han (25220 AD).  - The Battle of Red Cliffs, otherwise known as the Battle of Chibi, was a decisive battle fought at the end of the Han dynasty, about twelve years prior to the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history. It was fought in the winter of AD 208/9 between the allied forces of the southern warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan and the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao. Liu Bei and Sun Quan successfully frustrated Cao Cao's effort to conquer the land south of the Yangtze River and reunite the territory of the Eastern Han dynasty. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun Quan, gave them control of the Yangtze , and provided a line of defence that was the basis for the later creation of the two southern states of Shu Han and Eastern Wu. The battle has been called the largest naval battle in history in terms of numbers involved.  - Jin Xuan (died 209), courtesy name Yuanji (), was a minor warlord and Administrator of Wuling Commandery in the late Eastern Han Dynasty.  - The Xin dynasty was a Chinese dynasty (termed so despite having only one emperor) which lasted from 9 to 23 AD. It interrupted the Han dynasty, dividing it into the periods of the Western Han and the Eastern Han.  - Cao Wei (220265) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). With its capital at Luoyang, the state was established by Cao Pi in 220, based upon the foundations laid by his father, Cao Cao, towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty. The name \\"Wei\\" first became associated with Cao Cao when he was named the Duke of Wei by the Eastern Han government in 213, and became the name of the state when Cao Pi proclaimed himself emperor in 220. Historians often add the prefix \\"Cao\\" to distinguish it from other Chinese states known as \\"Wei\\", such as Wei of the Warring States period and Northern Wei of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. The authority of the ruling Cao family gradually weakened after the death of the second Wei emperor, Cao Rui, and eventually fell into the hands of Sima Yi, a Wei regent, and his family, in 249. Cao Rui's successors remained as puppet rulers under the control of the Simas until Sima Yi's grandson, Sima Yan, forced the last Wei ruler, Cao Huan, to abdicate the throne and established the Jin dynasty.  - Cao Cao (155  15 March 220), courtesy name Mengde, was a Chinese warlord and the penultimate Chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty who rose to great power in the final years of the dynasty. As one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms period, he laid the foundations for what was to become the state of Cao Wei and was posthumously honoured as \\"Emperor Wu of Wei\\". Although he is often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant in subsequent literature, Cao Cao has also been praised as a brilliant ruler and military genius who treated his subordinates like his family. During the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty, Cao Cao was able to secure the most populated and prosperous cities of the central plains and northern China. Cao had much success as the Han chancellor, but his handling of the Han emperor Liu Xie was heavily criticized and resulted in a continued and then escalated civil war. Opposition directly gathered around warlords Liu Bei and Sun Quan, whom Cao was unable to quell. Cao was also skilled in poetry and martial arts and wrote many war journals.  - Shu or Shu Han (221263) was one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period (220280). The state was based in the area around present-day Sichuan and Chongqing, which was historically known as \\"Shu\\" after an earlier state in Sichuan named Shu. Shu Han's founder Liu Bei had named his state \\"Han\\" as he considered it the legitimate successor to the Han dynasty, while \\"Shu\\" is added to the name as a geographical prefix to differentiate it from the many \\"Han\\" states throughout Chinese history.  - Liu Biao (142208), courtesy name Jingsheng, was a warlord and the governor of Jing Province who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He was a member of the extended family of the Han emperors, descended from Liu Yu, the fifth son of Emperor Jing.  - Guizhou, formerly romanized as Kweichow, is a province of the People's Republic of China located in the southwestern part of the country. Its capital city is Guiyang. Name. The area was first organized as an administrative region of a Chinese empire under the Tang, when it was named Juzhou, pronounced \\"Kjú-jyuw\\" in the Middle Chinese of the period. During the Mongolian Yuan dynasty, the character (\\"ju\\", \\"carpenter's square\\") was changed to the more refined (\\"gui\\", \\"precious or expensive\\"). The region formally became a province in 1413, with an eponymous capital then also called \\"Guizhou\\" but now known as Guiyang.  - Zhao Fan was a minor warlord and prefect of Guiyang Commandery during the late Han Dynasty period of Chinese history. Zhao Fan surrendered to Zhao Yun after being attacked by his army at Guiyang following the Battle of Red Cliffs. Zhao Fan then unintentionally sparked the rage of Zhao Yun by suggesting his marriage to his older brother's widow. He became a minister of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period.  - The Qin dynasty was the first dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 206 BC. Named for its heartland of Qin, in modern-day Gansu and Shaanxi, the dynasty was formed after the conquest of six other states by the Qin state, and its founding emperor named Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of Qin. The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC, during the Warring States period. In the mid and late third century BC, the Qin accomplished a series of swift conquests, first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty, and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States to gain control over the whole of China. It is also the shortest dynasty in Chinese history, lasting only 15 years with two emperors.  - Zhao Yun (died 229), courtesy name Zilong, was a military general who lived in the late Eastern Han dynasty and early Three Kingdoms period. Originally a subordinate of the northern warlord Gongsun Zan, Zhao Yun later came to serve another warlord, Liu Bei, and had since accompanied him on most of his military exploits, from the Battle of Changban (208) to the Hanzhong Campaign (217219). He continued serving in the state of Shu Han  founded by Liu Bei in 221  in the Three Kingdoms period and participated in the first of the Northern Expeditions until his death in 229. While many facts about Zhao Yun's life remain unclear due to limited information in historical sources, some aspects and activities in his life had been dramatised or exaggerated in folklore and fiction, most notably in Luo Guanzhong's historical novel \\"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\\", in which he was lauded as a member of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei.  - Liu Bei (161  10 June 223), courtesy name Xuande, was a warlord in the late Eastern Han dynasty who founded the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period and became its first ruler. Despite early failings compared to his rivals and lacking both the material resources and social status they commanded, he gathered support along disheartened Han loyalists who objected to Cao Cao's reign over the emperor and relied heavily on this support. Liu Bei overcame his many defeats to carve out his own realm, which at its peak spanned present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Hunan, parts of Hubei, and parts of Gansu.  - Emperor Gaozu of Han (256 BC  June 1, 195 BC), born Liu Bang, was the founder and first emperor of the Han dynasty, reigning from 202  195 BC. He was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history with humble origin from the peasant class.  - The Three Kingdoms (AD 220280) was the tripartite division of China between the states of Wei, Shu, and Wu, following the Han dynasty and preceding the Jin dynasty. The term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" itself is something of a mistranslation, since each state was eventually headed not by a king, but by an emperor who claimed legitimate succession from the Han dynasty. Nevertheless, the term \\"Three Kingdoms\\" has become standard among sinologists. To further distinguish the three states from other historical Chinese states of similar names, historians have added a relevant character: Wei is also known as Cao Wei, Shu is also known as Shu Han, and Wu is also known as Dong (or Eastern) Wu.  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.

Solve this instance: Analyzing the roll of the foot remains standard practice among fitness and medical professionals in the belief it will lead to a better shoe fit and fewer injuries. “When it comes to shoe choice, the amount of pronation control is extremely important,” said Dr. Jane Andersen, a podiatrist in private practice in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. “Some people need more than others. It can cause a lot of problems if you have the wrong one.”  Anderson, a runner herself and past president of the American Association for Women Podiatrists, said the No. 1 cause of the overuse injuries she sees, from stress fractures to tendonitis to Plantar fasciitis (heel pain), is shoes that are worn out or the wrong fit. There are three basic levels of control for standard running shoes: neutral, stability and motion control. “Neutral is generally good for a high-arch foot; it doesn’t provide extra control for pronation,” she said. “The stability shoe works for people who need more support; motion control is for the super flat-footed.”  At Jack Rabbit Sports store in New York City, clients’ arches are observed before they hit the treadmill for runs that are videotaped for slow-motion analysis. “The basic premise is that most people land on their heel (and) overpronate or underpronate,” said Johanna Bjorken, the store’s merchandise director. “This causes running injuries and shoes can address this. This has been the model.”  Bjorken said neutral shoes account for 60 to 63 percent of the running shoes sold in her store; 30 to 35 percent are stability shoes. The mobility category is very small and usually follows on doctor’s advice. “Some rolling in is natural, normal and beneficial,” she explained. “Compared to 20 years ago, running shoes are really much more flexible, lightweight and well designed to work with movements of running.”  American Council on Exercise spokesperson, Dr. Mark Kelly, a runner for 35 years, is a self-described underpronator who believes in heeding an individual’s “biomechanical tendencies.”  “Get a certified trainer to look at the biomechanics of how you’re running,” Kelly said. “How are you turning your foot? Are you a forefoot striker, midfoot striker, heel striker, or extreme heel striker?”  Connecticut-based exercise physiologist Tom Holland, author of “The Marathon Method,” thinks many of the common running-related injuries, such as runner’s knee, shin splints and hip issues are related to and exacerbated by improper footwear. “Once you find a shoe that works for you, stick with it,” he said. Nevertheless, a recent Danish study cast doubt on whether shoes that control pronation do actually cut down on injury. But the scientists said more work is needed to determine if highly pronated feet face a higher risk of injury than neutral feet.

He was really informative and helped us pick through the menu. The interior is contemporary Japanese and beautiful. And the food was fantastic.  We had a tasty hamachi sashimi with jalapeno slices. I've had this dish at other places but Nobu slices the jalapenos paper thin and dresses the fish in a fantastic sauce. Their rendition also includes a cilantro leaf and I'm a huge fan of the herb. Great balance of flavors and quality of fish. Tuna sashimi salad. This is a mountain of crisp salad with the sashimi draped around the base. It's a little technically difficult to eat because I wasn't sure how to get it all in one bite. But the salad was delicious and the tuna was, of course, amazing. Blue fin toro with caviar. I think toro needs to be eaten as sashimi/nirigi or over rice as chirashi. Mincing it up seems wrong.  And the highlight was the lobster spiced dish with seven spices and liberal amounts of clarified butter. Holy Gawd!! This was fantastic!! It was an explosion of flavors in your mouth and utterly, indescribably delicious. They split the lobster lengthwise in half, cook the meat in large chunks, and then place it back into the shell.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Cleisthenes (\\"Kleisthéns\\"; also Clisthenes or Kleisthenes) was a noble Athenian of the Alcmaeonid family. He is credited with reforming the constitution of ancient Athens and setting it on a democratic footing in 508/7 BC. For these accomplishments, historians refer to him as \\"the father of Athenian democracy.\\" He was the maternal grandson of the tyrant Cleisthenes of Sicyon, as the younger son of the latter's daughter Agariste and her husband Megacles. Also, he was credited with increasing the power of the Athenian citizens assembly and for reducing the power of the nobility over Athenian politics.  - In Ancient Greece, a deme or demos was a suburb of Athens or a subdivision of Attica, the region of Greece surrounding Athens. Demes as simple subdivisions of land in the countryside seem to have existed in the 6th century BC and earlier, but did not acquire particular significance until the reforms of Cleisthenes in 508 BC. In those reforms, enrollment in the citizen-lists of a deme became the requirement for citizenship; prior to that time, citizenship had been based on membership in a phratry, or family group. At this same time, demes were established in the city of Athens itself, where they had not previously existed; in all, at the end of Cleisthenes' reforms, Attica was divided into 139 demes to which one should add Berenikidai, established in 224/223 BC, Apollonieis (201/200 BC) and Antinoeis (126/127). The establishment of demes as the fundamental units of the state weakened the gene, or aristocratic family groups, that had dominated the phratries.  - The Peloponnesian League was an alliance in the Peloponnesus from the 6th to the 4th centuries BC. It is known mainly for being one of the two rivals in the Peloponnesian War (431404 BC)  - The Clouds ( Ancient Greek :  Nephelai ) is a Greek comedy play written by the celebrated playwright Aristophanes . A lampooning of intellectual fashions in classical Athens , it was originally produced at the City Dionysia in 423 BC and was not as well - received as the author had hoped , coming last of the three plays competing at the festival that year . It was revised between 420 - 417 BC and was thereafter circulated in manuscript form . No copy of the original production survives , and scholarly analysis indicates that the revised version is an incomplete form of Old Comedy . This incompleteness , however , is not obvious in translations and modern performances . Retrospectively , The Clouds can be considered the world 's first extant ' comedy of ideas ' , and is considered by literary critics to be among the finest example of the genre . The play also , however , remains notorious for its caricature of Socrates , and is mentioned in Plato 's Apology as a contributor to the philosopher 's trial and execution .  - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.  - A city-state is a sovereign state that consists of a city and its dependent territories. Historically, this included cities such as Rome, Athens, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Renaissancebut today only a handful of sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which are city-states. A great deal of consensus exists that the term properly applies to Singapore, Monaco, and Vatican City.  - The Delian League, founded in 478 BC, was an association of Greek city-states, members numbering between 150 173, to 330 under the leadership of Athens, whose purpose was to continue fighting the Persian Empire after the Greek victory in the Battle of Plataea at the end of the Second Persian invasion of Greece. The League's modern name derives from its official meeting place, the island of Delos, where congresses were held in the temple and where the treasury stood until, in a symbolic gesture, Pericles moved it to Athens in 454 BC.  - Aristophanes (or  ; c. 446  c. 386 BC), son of Philippus, of the deme Kydathenaion, was a comic playwright of ancient Athens. Eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete. These, together with fragments of some of his other plays, provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Comedy, and are used to define it.  - The Lamian War, or the Hellenic War (323322 BC) was fought by a coalition of Greek cities including Athens and the Aetolian League against Macedon and its ally Boeotia. The war ended in a Macedonian victory.  - The Peloponnesian War (431404 BC) was an ancient Greek war fought by Athens and its empire against the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta. Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. In the first phase, the Archidamian War, Sparta launched repeated invasions of Attica, while Athens took advantage of its naval supremacy to raid the coast of the Peloponnese and attempt to suppress signs of unrest in its empire. This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC, with the signing of the Peace of Nicias. That treaty, however, was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese. In 415 BC, Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily; the attack failed disastrously, with the destruction of the entire force, in 413 BC. This ushered in the final phase of the war, generally referred to either as the Decelean War, or the Ionian War. In this phase, Sparta, now receiving support from Persia, supported rebellions in Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia, undermining Athens' empire, and, eventually, depriving the city of naval supremacy. The destruction of Athens' fleet at Aegospotami effectively ended the war, and Athens surrendered in the following year. Corinth and Thebes demanded that Athens should be destroyed and all its citizens should be enslaved, but Sparta refused.  - Pericles (\\"Perikls\\", in Classical Attic; c. 495  429 BC) was a prominent and influential Greek statesman, orator and general of Athens during the Golden Agespecifically the time between the Persian and Peloponnesian wars. He was descended, through his mother, from the powerful and historically influential Alcmaeonid family.  - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece.  - The city of Athens during the classical period of Ancient Greece (508322 BC) was the major urban center of the notable polis (city-state) of the same name, located in Attica, Greece, leading the Delian League in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League. Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War). The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the Age of Pericles.  - Hegemony (or , or  \\"leadership, rule\\") is the political, economic, or military predominance or control of one state over others. In ancient Greece (8th century BCE  6th century CE), \\"hegemony\\" denoted the politicomilitary dominance of a city-state over other city-states. The dominant state is known as the \\"hegemon\\".  - Democracy (\\"\\" literally \\"rule of the commoners\\"), in modern usage, is a system of government in which the citizens exercise power directly or elect representatives from among themselves to form a governing body, such as a parliament. Democracy is sometimes referred to as \\"rule of the majority\\". Democracy was originally conceived in Classical Greece, where political representatives were chosen by a jury from amongst the male citizens: rich and poor.  - Old Comedy (\\"archaia\\") is the first period of the ancient Greek comedy, according to the canonical division by the Alexandrian grammarians. The most important Old Comic playwright is Aristophanes  whose works, with their daring political commentary and abundance of sexual innuendo, effectively define the genre today. Aristophanes satirized and lampooned the most prominent personalities and institutions of his time, as can be seen, for example, in his scurrilous portrayal of Socrates in \\"The Clouds\\", and in his racy anti-war farce \\"Lysistrata\\". Aristophanes was only one of a large number of comic poets, however, working in Athens in the late 5th century BC; his biggest rivals were Hermippus and Eupolis.  - Polis, plural poleis literally means city in Greek. It can also mean citizenship and body of citizens. In modern historiography, \\"polis\\" is normally used to indicate the ancient Greek city-states, like Classical Athens and its contemporaries, and thus is often translated as \\"city-state\\".  - Attica (or ; or ) is a historical region that encompasses the city of Athens, the capital of Greece. The historical region is centered on the Attic peninsula, which projects into the Aegean Sea. The modern administrative region of Attica is more extensive than the historical region and includes the Saronic Islands, Cythera, and the municipality of Troizinia on the Peloponnesian mainland. The history of Attica is tightly linked with that of Athens, which, from the classical period, was one of the most important cities in the ancient world.

Next question: who wrote the song he's so fine?","output":"\\"He's So Fine\\" is a song written by Ronald Mack, whose full name is Ronald Wilbur Mashburn. He was an American songwriter who is best known for composing this song. \\"He's So Fine\\" is a classic example of 1960s doo-wop and pop music, characterized by its distinctive melody, catchy rhythm, and memorable lyrics. The song became widely popular and achieved commercial success after it was recorded and released by The Chiffons, an all-female vocal group from the United States. In 1963, The Chiffons recorded \\"He's So Fine\\" under the supervision of producer and composer Phil Spector. The song features three singers from The Chiffons – Judy Craig (lead vocalist), Patricia Bennett, and Barbara Lee, with Sylvia Peterson joining the group later. \\"He's So Fine\\" became the Chiffons' biggest and most enduring hit, soaring to number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and remaining there for four weeks. The song's success catapulted The Chiffons to new heights of fame and secured their place in music history. The distinct sound and style of \\"He's So Fine\\" has had a lasting influence on popular music, inspiring numerous covers, adaptations, and even legal disputes. Perhaps the most notable instance is George Harrison's 1970 song \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" which was the subject of a high-profile copyright infringement lawsuit due to its similarities with \\"He's So Fine.\\" In 1976, a court ruled that Harrison had 'subconsciously copied' parts of \\"He's So Fine\\" while writing \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" highlighting the song's enduring impact on the music world. Ronald Mack's contribution to pop music history, \\"He's So Fine,\\" remains a beloved and recognizable song to this day, making him a noteworthy figure in the annals of music composition.

News article: The Next Nightmare May Lurk in the Medicine Cabinet A long list of popular medications, from antihistamines to antidepressants to beta-blockers, are known to cause nightmares, largely because they interrupt natural REM and nonREM sleep cycles. Melinda Beck on Lunch Break looks at why this happens. The next time you're outrunning a pack of hungry wolves, naked, and then wake up in a cold sweat, remind yourself it's only a bad dream—and that it could be a side effect of a prescription medication you're taking. A wide array of drugs can cause nightmares. The list includes certain antidepressants, antibiotics, beta blockers, blood-pressure medications, statins for lowering cholesterol and drugs for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Some drugs tend to cause bad dreams when they are first taken; others bring nightmares when they're stopped. Alcohol, over-the-counter antihistamines and some dietary supplements have the same effect. \\"This is a very common complaint,\\" says Andres San Martin, a psychiatrist in New York City. \\"You put a patient on an antidepressant and routinely, they'll say, 'You know I'm feeling better, but I'm having very vivid dreams.' The emotion and passion can be quite overwhelming.\\" Although the mechanisms aren't completely understood, sleep experts think drugs cause nightmares because they interfere with so-called sleep architecture—the stages of light, deep and rapid-eye-movement, or REM, sleep that people typically rotate through three or four times a night. The REM stages, during which the most vivid dreams occur, normally get longer toward morning. But some medications delay or decrease REM, and some create a \\"REM rebound\\" effect when people stop taking them, making the REM stage unusually long or intense. A broad array of prescription medications, including those to treat anxiety, high blood pressure and ADHD can cause disturbing, unusual dreams. \\"Whenever REM sleep is altered, that leads to nightmares,\\" says Naresh Dewan, a professor of sleep medicine at Creighton University in Omaha, Neb., and co-author of a review of drug-induced sleep disturbances in June in the journal Consultant Pharmacist. Sleep experts say medications particularly apt to bring troubling dreams are those that affect neurotransmitters, the brain's chemical messengers that influence sleep cycles, among other things. That includes most antidepressants, as well as antihistamines and anticholinergic drugs used to treat a broad range of conditions, from overactive bladder to bronchial spasms. Sleeping pills can also disrupt sleep cycles and cause nightmares. Pinpointing how frequently medications cause nightmares is difficult because bad dreams are so common, and there's no way to prove cause and effect. Nearly 90% of people have nightmares at some point and about 5% of adults have them chronically, according to the American Sleep Association. Bad dreams may also be due to sleep apnea, insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder or a carry-over from anxiety during the day. People should suspect a drug connection if weird or disturbing dreams have begun soon after starting a new medication or stopping an old one, sleep specialists say. Sleep experts say drugs may interfere with so-called sleep architecture. Some prescription drug labels have warnings of mention the possibility of nightmares, abnormal dreams or sleep disturbances, but some experts say nightmares they are probably underreported in trials and on labels because patients don't think to mention them, and doctors rarely ask. \\"From a doctor's point of view, it's sometimes a Pandora's box because if you start routinely asking all patients about their dreams, you may be opening something that medicine cannot fix,\\" says P. Murali Doraiswamy a neuroscientist at Duke University Medical School. It isn't clear why disrupted REM sleep tends to bring nightmares rather than more pleasant dreams. \\"The purpose, triggers and biology of dreams, both pleasant and frightening, are still some of the biggest mysteries in all of science,\\" says Dr. Doraiswamy. \\"It could be an evolutionary defense mechanism or could be the brain's way of doing psychotherapy on itself.\\" Modern psychiatrists, led by Allan Hobson of Harvard Medical School, believe dreams are electrical pulses from the brain stem randomly bombarding the center of the brain where visual memories are stored, creating kaleidoscopes of images around which the brain concocts stories. Followers of Sigmund Freud believe dreams are repressed desires or threats. Nightmares aren't necessarily harmful themselves, but if they happen frequently, they can set the stage for chronic sleep deprivation, which can hamper daytime functioning and increase the risk of diabetes and other health problems. Some nightmares are so disturbing that the effects linger for hours or longer. Alesandra Rain still recalls the dreams of suicide she had while taking a variety of sleep and pain medications nine years ago. In one, she went skydiving with a defective parachute; in another, she removed the lug nuts from her tires and gunned her car down a winding mountain road. Ms. Rain, 54, was so disturbed by the dreams and the long list of drugs she was taking that she quit them cold turkey and started a nonprofit organization, Point of Return, in Westlake Village, Calif., to help others wean themselves off of multiple prescription drugs. \\"I haven't had a nightmare in nine years,\\" she says. Some medications that have been reported to cause abnormal dreams and other sleep disturbances. Source: Drug labels; The Consultant Pharmacist, June, 2011 Most physicians tell patients not to stop medications abruptly on their own. Tapering off can help avoid withdrawal nightmares. In some cases, taking a drug at a different time of day can improve sleep. Dr. San Martin tells patients to take some SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) in the morning, but those that have a sedative effect closer to bedtime. Cutting dosages or switching to another brand in the same class may also be an option. For severe sleep disruption, some doctors give patients yet another prescription to help them sleep. Common choices include Klonopin, an antiseizure medication; Trazodone, often used in sleep clinics for insomnia, or Prazosin, a beta blocker that helps quell anxiety. All three can bring on nightmares themselves, so some doctors see prescribing a new drug as a last resort. Some chronic nightmare sufferers find relief with Image Rehearsal Therapy, a technique pioneered in the 1990s in which patients write out their typical nightmare, then imagine a new, benign ending for it. Shelby Harris, director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, N.Y., says her favorite example was a young patient who kept dreaming he was being chased by a scary man. In the new scenario he concocted, the setting was the theme park in Hershey, Pa. The man was made of chocolate and the boy ate him. Patients practice visualizing the new dream several times a day for several weeks. Even if that particular dream never recurs, the nightmares typically end. \\"Once people believe they have control over their nightmare, that's when they start to get better,\\" says Dr. Harris. Experts say that people who are troubled by nightmares should let their doctors know. Disturbed REM sleep and vivid dreaming can also be an early warning sign of some types of epilepsy, dementia and Parkinson's disease. \\"It's important to address whether [nightmares] are due to a medication or if something else is going on,\\" says Dr. Harris. \\"Don't assume that nothing can be done.\\" Write to Melinda Beck at HealthJournal@wsj.com What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

Please write a short summary for the following article: New York’s New High-End Rentals A slew of high-end, high-profile rental buildings are poised to open across Manhattan and Brooklyn this year, adding more than 8,000 units at a pace not seen in years, and in the process, redefining what rental housing in the city can be. Many of these new rental buildings are large, tall and unusually shaped. Some are in untested residential areas, which might explain their devotion to lavishly entertaining their occupants by piling on the amenities both indoors and out. Soon-to-be-completed examples include Via 57West, on an industrial edge of Manhattan’s West Side; 461 Dean Street, by the Barclays Center at the Vanderbilt Yards in Brooklyn; and 365 Bond Street, on the banks of the Gowanus Canal. Prices, too, are lofty, with studios in some of the buildings renting for about 5,000 a month. While any softness in the rental market — new leasing activity has slowed in recent months, and vacancies are up — could spell challenges going forward, most developers say they are undeterred. “New York is safer and cleaner than it’s been in decades, and we fully expect people to keep moving here,” said Adam R. Rose, a president of Rose Associates, which is converting 70 Pine Street, an Art Deco office building in the financial district, into a 776-unit rental. “And the fact is, we need virtually unlimited housing at all levels,” he added. Once, a driveway and porte-cochere might have been enough to provide a building with an air of prestige, but rentals today seem to be springing for brash top-to-bottom designs. Like their condo kin, rentals are increasingly opting for architects with boldface names. Via 57West, a 709-unit rental at 625 West 57th Street, for example, was designed by the Bjarke Ingels Group. Mr. Ingels is the Danish designer whose résumé also includes Two World Trade Center. Those expecting four walls and a roof at Via, which is to open in March, may be disappointed. There is no roof at all, only sloping walls that taper to a point at the 42nd story, recalling a tilting tepee or a wizard’s hat, though the developer, the Durst Organization, prefers “tetrahedron.” Because the metal-paneled rental is near the West Side Highway, a gateway to Manhattan, the city’s Planning Commission didn’t want some humdrum rectangle, according to Durst officials. But Mr. Ingels’ great pyramid also allowed Durst to preserve Hudson River views from the windows of the Helena, a rental that the company owns next door, according to a Durst spokesman. The offbeat style produced unusual layouts. A 685-square-foot one-bedroom with tall windows that was a stop on a recent tour had an angled exterior wall, which might not be ideal for straight-backed furniture. “We have apartments with a lot of character to them,” said Jonathan Drescher, a Durst senior vice president. And those apartments seem tailored to younger, unattached renters, as 85 percent are studios, starting at 2,770 a month, or one-bedrooms, starting at 3,880. In contrast, the median price of a studio in Manhattan in December was 2,562 a month, while that of a one-bedroom was 3,375, according to a market report from Douglas Elliman Real Estate. Via and other buildings are adding rental units to the market in a banner development year. About 4,900 apartments in large and mostly market-rate buildings are expected to open their doors in Manhattan in 2016, according to data prepared for The New York Times by Cliff Finn, an executive vice president of Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, and George Wlodarczyk, a research director there. This is a significant increase, as the number has hovered below 3,000 a year since at least 2010. Eight of the 15 major buildings to open this year, according to Elliman, offer 300 apartments or more. Similarly, Brooklyn will add about 3,300 apartments in major projects in 2016, Elliman said, the most since 2014, when about 3,000 units entered the market. But in previous years, going back to 2007, the number of new apartments that opened in the borough was much lower. This housing surge comes at a time of some weakness in the market. In December, the median rent in the Manhattan luxury market — that is, the top 10 percent of all transactions — nudged down to 8,500 a month from 8,537 a month in November. Similarly, the November median was down from October, when it was 8,750, according to Elliman data prepared by Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm. In addition, the city has more empty apartments than usual. Traditionally, in New York, the dividing line between a robust and not-so-great market is a 2 percent vacancy rate. Since June of last year, the rate has been higher, with November’s at 2.87 percent, the highest in nine years, Mr. Miller said. In December, the rate was 2.74 percent. With empty apartments and dipping rents, the market is not ideally suited for thousands of new units, which could depress prices further. For renters, that could be a good thing. Mr. Miller said concessions are already part of the picture. Both Via 57West and 70 Pine are offering two free months on a 14-month lease, which is more than the one month traditionally offered under similar conditions, Mr. Miller said. “I think there is great confusion about demand for this product,” Mr. Miller added. “It’s not correct to say that demand is not there for this new product. It is more accurate to say that in many, if not most, cases, demand is not there at prices set a few years ago.” Of course, developers won’t really know where things stand until their rental offices actually open. But so far, many of the rentals scheduled to hit the market in the next few months come with high monthly price tags. The new 11-story, 106-unit rental from the Related Companies at 456 Washington Street in TriBeCa, for instance, will have studios starting at 4,995 a month, while one-bedrooms will start at 5,295, though a Related spokeswoman pointed out that the building, which is to open in May, is in a prime location, and that its apartments are larger than most of the firm’s other properties. Studios are around 600 square feet, she said, while one-bedrooms range from 700 to 750 square feet. Also in May, Related will unveil the Easton, a 230-unit rental on East 92nd Street, where one-bedrooms will start at 4,295 a month. If rents seem steep, they need to be considered along with the costs of building apartment houses, which can be astronomical, according to Jed Walentas, a principal of Two Trees Management Company, which is developing 300 Ashland Place, a 379-unit tower across from the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, to open at summer’s end. The building, clad in aluminum-composite panels, was designed by TEN Arquitectos, Enrique Norten’s firm. From above, the building resembles a flattened football with its pointed ends trimmed, creating slightly curving walls. It was built under the 421-a program, which gives developers breaks on their property taxes if they construct and maintain affordable housing in a so-called 80-20 building — 80 percent market-rate rents and 20 percent below-market or affordable rents. Developers say that in a city where land is so pricey, it can be almost impossible to build without the program, especially rentals, for which revenue trickles in over time. The controversial benefit, which critics say enriches developers at the expense of the public and has outlived its usefulness, expired in January, and its impending end helped fuel the current rental-building boom, some developers say. Other builders, though, say the rental surge is more the result of the post-recession recovery, and began when these projects were conceived a few years ago. At 300 Ashland Place, 421-a has made a big difference. The 170 million project will realize savings of up to 2 million a year in property taxes for 25 years, or about 50 million, according to Two Trees officials, in exchange for the building’s 76 below-market-rate apartments. As Mr. Walentas scanned the horizon from his rising tower, which provides views of low-slung sections of Brooklyn that were mostly unattainable before the rental boom, he said he wasn’t worried about competition. “The more people build, the better it’s going to be for everybody,” he said, adding that the rising buildings help strengthen neighborhoods. One new rental in the current crop, 461 Dean Street in Brooklyn, will be split almost evenly between apartments with below-market rents and market-rate apartments. The 363-unit project from Forest City Ratner Companies, which is made of prefabricated modules, will have 181 apartments with lower rents. About 40 percent of the affordable units, or 72, will be for people making 100 percent to 160 percent of the area’s median income, or up to 138,080 for a family of four. That family could end up paying 2,800 a month for a two-bedroom, said Susi Yu, an executive vice president of Forest City. “This is actually a segment of the market that really has been overlooked,” Ms. Yu said, referring to the income bracket of that same family of four. Forest City has not yet determined what a market-rate two-bedroom would cost in the building. In December, the median price of a two-bedroom in Brooklyn was 3,350 a month, Elliman said. To score one of the coveted reduced-rent units at 461 Dean, renters must enter a lottery, which will be organized by Forest City and the city’s Housing Development Corporation. When the lottery is announced, which is expected “imminently,” according to a project spokeswoman, applicants will have 60 days to register at the New York City Housing Connect web page, or by paper application. To get the word out about the application process, Forest City will contact labor unions, community boards and churches. Each applicant will receive a number. If that number is drawn, he or she must submit tax returns, landlord references and bank statements to verify eligibility. Priority will be given to people with visual impairments and other disabilities, and secondarily, to those who live within the boundaries of Brooklyn Community Boards 2, 3, 6 and 8. Municipal workers also will have an advantage. As has been the case for several years, buildings in less-residential neighborhoods are packed with extras designed to give their occupants something to do in otherwise quiet areas. But the amount of space dedicated to these amenities has mushroomed. At Via by the West Side Highway, for instance, the 30,000 square feet of indoor amenity space will include a 75-foot swimming pool, a half basketball court and a leather-walled room designated for poker. A terraced courtyard planted with pitch pines, river birches and honey locusts will offer another 22,000 square feet of communal space. Four retail spaces will line the building’s base. Another 75-foot swimming pool will turn up at Eos, a glassy 375-unit Durst project at 100 West 31st Street in NoMad to open this year. Sidewalk windows peer down at the pool, so passers-by can admire people doing the backstroke below. Meanwhile in Brooklyn, at 365 Bond Street, a 430-unit, 80-20 building from the Lightstone Group next to the Gowanus Canal, a Superfund site, residents will avail themselves of 40,000 square feet of amenity space. Among the offerings are a yoga room, a children’s playroom and a rooftop lounge with barbecue grills. The building, which broke ground in 2014, opens in March. Interest in the affordable component has been intense, with more than 56,000 applications received for the 86 below-market units. Applications closed last month. Market-rate studios there will start in the “low 2,000s,” a spokesman said, adding that “we don’t have concessions finalized yet.” The building will be by a dock from which kayaks can be launched for paddling the Gowanus, which is scheduled to be cleaned starting this year, said Mitchell C. Hochberg, Lightstone’s president. “I think Gowanus is one of the most exciting places in the city, like Williamsburg 10 years ago,” Mr. Hochberg said. But in a shift, even developers in more central areas are acknowledging a new cultural reality: that young renters, who may work and live under the same roof, and have all their groceries delivered, might not set foot outside that much. At amenity-loaded 70 Pine, “the whole idea is that you don’t ever have to leave the building,” Mr. Rose said. Rents for studios on the lower floors of the 1932 building, which are now being marketed, start at 3,100 a month, and 21 leases were signed between December and the end of January. The next batch of studios, on higher floors, will inch up to 3,200 a month, Mr. Rose said. The building has about 19,000 square feet of amenities, spread across two below-grade levels, including a two-lane bowling alley and a 20-seat screening room in an old bank vault, whose door will be welded into the open position. Seventy Pine’s fitness center will be run by La Palestra, a company whose services extend to arranging out-of-building exercise at places like Mount Kilimanjaro. There will be about 31,500 square feet of retail space, including a branch of the upscale grocer Urban Market. And the top four levels of the building, which has a window-lined observation deck, will house a yet-to-be named restaurant from the team behind the Spotted Pig in the West Village. The list of amenities dazzles even Mr. Rose. “I’ve been in this business for 30 years, and we’ve never done this much in one place before,” he said. Correction: February 9, 2016 An earlier version of this article misstated the maximum income for a family of four to be eligible for an affordable two-bedroom apartment at 461 Dean Street in Brooklyn, based on information supplied by the developer, Forest City Ratner Companies. It is 138,080, not 124,000. Summary:","output":"New York is seeing an influx of luxury apartment buildings opening across Manhattan and Brooklyn, redefining rental property expectations within the city. Over 8,000 new rental units are set to open this year alone, boasting a variety of high-end features and amenities, as bold face-name architects now also design rental properties, in addition to condos. The prices are increasing just as quickly as the buildings themselves, with the median price of a studio apartment in Manhattan now at 2,562 a month, according to a market report from Douglas Elliman Real Estate. A significant increase in new apartment buildings is expected in Manhattan this year, with around 4,900 large rental units coming to the market, up from below 3,000 a year since at least 2010. Developers seem confident in the market despite recent increases in the number of empty apartments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The organizers of New York City's annual march down Fifth Avenue are about to find out.      The makers of the popular Irish beer announced over the weekend that they pulled their sponsorship of the parade due to organizers' longstanding rule against gay and lesbian groups marching openly.      ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT      \\"Guinness has a strong history of supporting diversity and being an advocate for equality for all,” the company said in a statement posted on the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation website Sunday. \\"We were hopeful that the policy of exclusion would be reversed for this year’s parade. As this has not come to pass, Guinness has withdrawn its participation. We will continue to work with community leaders to ensure that future parades have an inclusionary policy.\\"      The move by Guinness follows similar moves by fellow beer companies Heineken and Sam Adams, the latter of which pulled its sponsorship from Sunday's parade in the traditional Irish stronghold of South Boston. The decision also left Ford Motor Company as the only major U.S. company sponsoring the New York City parade, which dates back to 1762.      Companies aren't the only ones conspicuous by their absence from city parades. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio will become the first mayor in decades to sit out the march due to the dispute. Boston Mayor Martin Walsh didn't take part in his city's parade, either, after talks broke down that would have allowed a gay group to march.      One leader who does plan to march in New York Monday is Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, who defended himself against criticism over his decision earlier this week, saying \\"The St. Patrick's Day parade (in New York) is a parade about our Irishness and not about sexuality, and I would be happy to participate in it.\\"      Parade organizers have said gay groups are not prohibited from marching, but are not allowed to carry gay-friendly signs or identify themselves as LGBT.      In Michigan, parades were Sunday held in Bay City and Detroit, and on Monday a St. Patrick's Day Parade was scheduled in Cleveland. Cities from Savannah, Ga., to Montreal also hosted festivities over the weekend, and throughout the world landmarks were bathed in green floodlights.      Some LGBT groups were to protest the parade, while others had planned to dump Guinness from the shelves of the Stonewall Inn, the birthplace of the gay rights movement. That demonstration was canceled late Sunday after Guinness put out its statement yanking its sponsorship.      Despite the controversy, New York's parade, a tradition that predates the city itself, is expected to draw more than 1 million spectators and about 200,000 participants Monday. It has long been a mandatory stop on the city's political trail, and will include marching bands, traditional Irish dancers and thousands of uniformed city workers.      The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| Bill de Blasio and Martin Walsh (L) speak to the press outside the West Wing of the White House in Washington, December 13, 2013, following their meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama and other newly-elected mayors about job creation.      BOSTON Irish brewer Guinness said on Sunday that it would not participate in New York City's St. Patrick's Day parade this year because gay and lesbian groups had been excluded, costing organizers a key sponsor of the annual event.      The move came on the same day that Boston's Irish-American mayor skipped that city's St. Patrick's Day parade after failing to hammer out a deal with organizers to allow a group of gay and lesbian activists to march openly.      \\"Guinness has a strong history of supporting diversity and being an advocate for equality for all. We were hopeful that the policy of exclusion would be reversed for this year's parade,\\" the brewer said in a written statement issued by a spokesman for its parent company, Diageo.      \\"As this has not come to pass, Guinness has withdrawn its participation. We will continue to work with community leaders to ensure that future parades have an inclusionary policy,\\" Guinness said.      Last week New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said he would not march in the parade because gay and lesbian activists had been again precluded from taking part.      The loss of Guinness, one of the world's top beer brands originating in Dublin, Ireland, appeared to ratchet up the pressure on organizers even further.      On Friday, two other major beer companies, Sam Adams brewer Boston Beer Co and Heineken dropped their sponsorship of parades in Boston and New York, respectively, over the issue.      Representatives for the New York board of the Ancient Order of the Hibernians, which has run the parade for more than 150 years, could not be reached for comment on Sunday afternoon.      Earlier in the day Boston Mayor Marty Walsh skipped his city's parade when he couldn't negotiate a deal with organizers, the conservative Allied War Veteran's Council, to allow members of MassEquality, one of Massachusetts' largest gay activist groups, to join.      INCREASING CRITICISM      \\"So much of our Irish history has been shaped by the fight against oppression,\\" Walsh, the city's first Irish-American mayor in 20 years, said in a statement.      \\"As mayor of the city of Boston, I have to do my best to ensure that all Bostonians are free to participate fully in the civic life of our city. Unfortunately, this year, the parties were not able to come to an understanding that would have made that possible.\\"      Despite Walsh's boycott, other prominent Democratic Boston politicians, including Representative Stephen Lynch, marched in the parade, which drew tens of thousands of spectators, some of whom expressed disappointment at MassEquality's exclusion.      \\"It's supposed to be a time when everyone can come together,\\" said university student Jeyashri Sridhar, 18. \\"It's sad that people can't participate because of who they are.\\"      Organizers of St. Patrick's Day parades in New York and Boston, among the most liberal-leaning cities in the United States, have come under increasing criticism in recent years for banning openly gay marchers.      Parade organizers argue that to do so would conflict with their Roman Catholic heritage. The Catholic church contends that homosexual activity is immoral.      While MassEquality did not participate, the parade was not without gay marchers.      South Boston resident Randy Foster, along with his husband Steve Martin, organized a diversity-themed float that sported rainbow flags but no direct gay rights messages. Foster said the flags represented the proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow in Irish lore, though he acknowledged the gay-rights movement uses a rainbow flag.      \\"If there's a dual message to it, we're OK with it and so are the parade organizers,\\" said Foster, 48. \\"We made the point of not making it a gay float.

But Ireland's Prime Minister refused to be sidelined, saying he'll join the procession Monday in Manhattan because the holiday is about Irishness, not sexuality.      From left, J.T.

(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer) (Associated Press)      New York's Irish, their descendants and the Irish for a day planned to revel in the celebration of culture on Monday, but de Blasio's decision to skip the parade underscores lingering political tensions over gay rights issues in the Northeast.      Boston's Mayor Martin Walsh opted out of his city's parade on Sunday after talks broke down that would have allowed a gay veterans group to march. Parade organizers said they did not want the event to turn into a demonstration for a particular group, but Walsh said their plans prevented all Boston residents from participating fully.      Still, thousands of green-clad spectators came out to watch bagpipers and marchers in Boston, and organizers of a float intended to promote diversity threw Mardi Gras-type beads to onlookers. A similar scene played out in downtown Philadelphia.      In Michigan, parades were Sunday held in Bay City and Detroit, and on Monday, a St. Patrick's Day Parade was scheduled in Cleveland. Cities from Savannah, Ga., to Montreal also hosted festivities over the weekend, and throughout the world, landmarks were bathed in green floodlights.      Ireland's head of government, Enda Kenny, on Sunday became the first Irish prime minister to attend Boston's annual St. Patrick's Day breakfast.      Kenny has resisted pressure, in both Ireland and America, to support the gay rights lobby's demand to have equal rights to participate in parades on St. Patrick's Day.      \\"The St. Patrick's Day parade (in New York) is a parade about our Irishness and not about sexuality, and I would be happy to participate in it,\\" he said in Dublin before leaving for a six-day trip to the U.S.      In Ireland, St. Patrick's Day provides the launch of the country's annual push for tourism, a big part of the rural economy.      \\"To Irish people by birth or descent, wherever they may be in the world, and to those who simply consider themselves to be friends of Ireland, I wish each and every one of you a happy, peaceful and authentically Irish St. Patrick's Day,\\" Irish President Michael D. Higgins, the ceremonial head of state and guest of honor at Monday's parade in Dublin, said in a statement.      Parade organizers in New York have said gay groups are not prohibited from marching, but are not allowed to carry gay-friendly signs or identify themselves as LGBT.      Some LGBT groups were to protest the parade along the parade route on Fifth Avenue on Monday. Others had planned to dump Guinness beer from the shelves of the Stonewall Inn, the birthplace of the gay rights movement, in protest of the brewer's plan to sponsor the parade, but that demonstration was canceled late Sunday after Guinness said in a statement that it had dropped its sponsorship.      Other beer companies joined the boycotts earlier, with Sam Adams withdrawing its sponsorship of Boston's parade and Heineken following suit in New York.      New York's parade, a tradition that predates the city itself, draws more than 1 million spectators and about 200,000 participants every March 17. It has long been a mandatory stop on the city's political trail, and includes marching bands, traditional Irish dancers and thousands of uniformed city workers.      ___      Associated Press writer Shawn Pogatchnik in Dublin contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","output":"St. Patrick's Day parades in New York City and Boston faced controversies when Guinness and other major beer companies, Heineken and Sam Adams, pulled their sponsorships due to organizers' longstanding rule against gay and lesbian groups openly marching in the parade. The decision resulted in Ford Motor Company being the only major U.S. company to support the New York City parade. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio and Boston Mayor Martin Walsh also did not participate in the parades due to the exclusion of gay and lesbian groups. Guinness stated that they have a strong history of supporting diversity and advocating for equality, and they hope for an inclusive policy in future parades. Despite the controversies, the parade in New York City was expected to draw more than 1 million spectators and 200,000 participants."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Even if you know full well that you could never afford such an expensive vehicle, you don't forget the name, or the car. Why? You have been affected by product placement. Companies pay a film to place their products in the movie. Product placement took off in the West in the 1980s and is now catching on in China. Two Hunan Satellite TV dramas are recent examples:Ugly Wudi and Let's Go Watch the Meteor Shower (<<>> ). Shampoo, mobile phones, cars and fitness centers-anything can be product-placed. Advertisers value the mass appeal of the movies, knowing that a successful film can showcase their goods to hundreds of thousands of viewers. But when product placement takes over, artistic considerations can take a back seat. Cai Zhiyong has been product-placing for years. The Beijing-based advertiser admits there is a conflict between art and business. He explains the way one ad works. In If You are the One (<<>> ), the actress Shu Qi plays a flight attendant.

Dave Swarbrick, British Folk Fiddler, Dies at 75 Dave Swarbrick, a fiddler who electrified the British folk tradition as a member of the band Fairport Convention, died on Friday. He was 75. His death was announced on his website. The announcement did not say where he died or specify the cause, but he had emphysema for many years. Mr. Swarbrick and Fairport Convention were prime movers in trad-rock, which connected the 1960s ferment of folk-rock and psychedelia to a deep British heritage of storytelling ballads and nimble dance tunes. His fiddle playing had the deliberately rough-hewed sound of rural tradition; his tone could be sweet or scratchy, his phrases songful and melancholy or propulsive and gnarled with ornamental turns and quavers. He also sang, wrote songs and played viola, mandolin, mandola and guitar. Mr. Swarbrick was born in New Malden, Surrey, near London, on April 5, 1941. He learned to play fiddle as a child in Yorkshire. In the 1950s, the pianist Beryl Marriott heard him in a skiffle band and invited him to join her traditional Gaelic band, beginning a long association. By the early 1960s Mr. Swarbrick was being heard on the BBC series “Radio Ballads,” a mixture of oral history and music produced by the songwriter Ewan MacColl; he also recorded with Mr. MacColl, Peggy Seeger and other folk musicians. He appeared on seven albums with the Ian Campbell Folk Group in the early 1960s and in 1965 began recording with Martin Carthy, a leader of Britain’s folk revival. Mr. Swarbrick released his first solo album, “Rags, Reels and Airs,” in 1967. Fairport Convention, which had started as a folk-rock group strongly influenced by American styles, brought in Mr. Swarbrick as a sideman on the 1969 album “Unhalfbricking.” The Fairport version of the traditional song “A Sailor’s Life” emerged as an 11-minute maelstrom, with Mr. Swarbrick’s fiddle rising alongside Richard Thompson’s lead guitar, bringing echoes of past generations into the jam. For a pickup to amplify his instrument, Mr. Swarbrick recounted in the 2011 book “Electric Eden,” by Rob Young, “We smashed open a telephone and elastic-banded it to the fiddle.” Mr. Swarbrick switched to electric fiddle and joined Fairport Convention for its next album, “Liege & Lief,” also released in 1969. Merging rock instruments and riffs with traditional songs of love, war and murder, the album became a cornerstone of trad-rock. Fairport Convention’s lineup was perpetually unstable, and in the early 1970s Mr. Swarbrick took over more of the songwriting and lead singing. One of his major projects was Fairport’s 1971 concept album, “‘Babbacombe’ Lee,” about a Victorian convicted of murder who was freed after the gallows failed three times. Mr. Swarbrick was also a studio sideman on many British folk-rock recordings, and he continued to play more traditional music in the band Three Desperate Mortgages. The electric fiddle took a toll on Mr. Swarbrick’s hearing. By the end of the 1970s he was nearly deaf in one ear. He officially left Fairport Convention in 1984, although in 2007 he was part of a Fairport Convention lineup that reunited to perform “Liege & Lief” in concert. A smoker since his teens, Mr. Swarbrick struggled with failing health in the 1990s. He underwent three tracheotomies, and his emphysema grew so severe that at one point he needed oxygen onstage to perform. The British newspaper The Daily Telegraph mistakenly published an obituary for Mr. Swarbrick in 1999. “It’s not the first time I’ve died in Coventry,” he remarked afterward. A double lung transplant in 2004 improved his condition. He continued to make music, including a duo album with Mr. Carthy, “Straws in the Wind,” in 2006, and a final solo album, “Raison D’être” (2010), which gathered many of his collaborators through the decades. Mr. Swarbrick is survived by his wife, Jill Swarbrick-Banks; three children, Emily, Isobel and Alexander; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. He lived in Coventry. In a 2001 interview with the online music magazine Innerviews, Mr. Swarbrick said he had long had the same goals: “To continue to be as expressive as I can and to not hold back, as well as not going over the top either. I would like to continue to expand my repertoire and do it all with integrity and the occasional whiskey.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"Dave Swarbrick, a British folk fiddler, has passed away at the age of 75.

He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Testosterone can be broken up into 2 types, often referred to as T and DHT. DHT levels impact beard hair density, while T impacts beard hair thickness. Managing T and DHT levels under medical supervision may enhance your beard growth.  Do not use testosterone-boosting pills, creams, injections, or other products without the advice and guidance of your doctor. There can be a range of unwanted side effects, and you could end up impeding beard growth. Your doctor may recommend engaging in regular strength-training sessions as a way to naturally boost testosterone levels. Rogaine, the most common brand name for minoxidil, is widely used to slow the progress of male pattern baldness. If applied to the face properly, it should help stimulate beard growth. However, even though Rogaine is available over the counter in many areas, you should always consult your doctor before using it on your face.  This may be a better treatment option if you have patches where your beard doesn’t grow in well, as opposed to wanting your entire beard to grow in faster. If and when you stop treatment, any new hair growth may fall out. Microneedling involves rolling a device on your face that’s similar to a lint roller—except instead of sticky paper on the roller, it has hundreds of tiny needle points. Some advocates for micro-needling believe the tiny pinpricks stimulate the hair follicles and enhance beard growth.  Some dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons use in-office micro-needling to address issues like acne. Talk to a medical professional you trust before undergoing micro-needling treatments or buying a device yourself.  If used correctly, the process should be safe and relatively painless. However, it’s essential that the device is sanitized properly before each use according to the product instructions (usually by soaking it in alcohol). If there are areas of your beard that simply won’t grow in, hair transplants may be your only choice. As with top-of-the-head hair transplants, individual hair follicles are relocated from one area (like the back of the neck) to another (like your cheek).  Hair transplants usually require multiple procedures that are both costly and time-consuming. It may take up to 2 years to see the full results, and the procedure doesn’t always work. Transplants may help fill in gaps in your beard, but it won’t make your beard grow faster.","output":"Testosterone has 2 types, T and DHT. DHT helps make beard hair dense, and T makes it thick. With a doctor's help, you can manage these to grow your beard better. But don't use special pills, creams, or shots without a doctor's advice. They may cause problems. Your doctor may say it's okay to do muscle exercises to help boost testosterone. Rogaine is a common product that can help with beard growth, but always ask your doctor first. Microneedling is when you roll a tool with tiny needles on your face to help your beard grow. Talk to a medical person you trust before trying it. If some parts of your beard just don't grow, hair transplants may help. But it's a long, costly process and might not make your beard grow faster."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is the content of an email: Jeff,  Please accept my apologies for the slight delay in getting back to you on the message board regarding this week's API forecast. I'd like to take a minute of your time to highlight what we are doing to address all our concerns over our forecasts and how we are actively seeking to produce better results that we are all comfortable with and that provide useful insight and tradable information to our colleagues on the trading desks. As I am sure you know, forecasting the API's is not as scientific as other industry data such as the AGA's. The API is not consistently clear as to how it measures crude demand and this week's data is  a clear example of this in that there is a discrepancy of 1.2 million b/d between crude runs and the demand figure shown by the API. Each week the basis of measuring crude demand changes slightly. To address this we are looking at finding ways of predicting what we call the API Curve Ball Factor through a  variety of regressions / moving averages analysis. The second area we are in the process of perfecting is imports data. We are working closely with IT and Net Works to scrape real time shipping information in order to give us a better handle on crude coming in to the country. We are also recruiting a Quants PhD from Vince Kaminski's group who will be able to bring a slightly more scientific skill set to our team of business / economics skill sets. Please be assured that this issue is one we are giving the utmost priority to addressing. Having only recently taken on responsibility for the crude and products fundamentals team I have not had much opportunity to discuss issues with you. Please be assured that I am available at any time to discuss this, or any other, issue with you.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a 100 fine. If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.

EDM's 'summer of death' reporting is more than just tabloid raving In 2010, around the time of the last raves held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, former venue officials made the argument the parties there were no different than beer-fueled American football games held there. At the Los Angeles Rams’ season-opening home match at the Coliseum last weekend, at least 158 people were hospitalized for heat-related issues. (Temperatures were in the 90s.) But there was one huge difference: nobody died. Over the past 10 years there have been at least 25 drug-related deaths at parties hosted by just three LA-based rave promoters, the Los Angeles Times found. Parties such as Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) in Las Vegas have seen multiple drug-related deaths since moving there from the Coliseum in 2011. At Hard Summer this year, three patrons died. The cause is still under investigation. Last year two teenage girls died after attending Hard Summer. Both deaths were MDMA-related, coroner’s officials said. In the wake of these tragedies, and with a background of fewer venues willing to take risks on dance events, Hard announced it is not hosting its annual Day of the Dead festival in LA. Like in London, where one of the world’s greatest dance music venues, Fabric, appears to be no more due to factors triggered by the drug-related death of two teenagers in August, Los Angeles is in the midst of a rave crisis. Almost all of the city’s rave deaths are ecstasy-related, according to coroner’s conclusions. Yet for more than 20 years the electronic dance music scene has been blaming everything but itself – the media, “bad batch” pills, lack of party skills – for its drug problem. MDMA deaths have been constant here since the dawn of the 90s, when British ex-pats organized some of the first American raves in Los Angeles. In 1999 five teens died when the car they were in plunged off a mountain road following a rave(Ecstasy was one of the main drugs found in the victims’ bodies). Since those days the culture has returned to harm reduction as a means to combat the fatalities. DanceSafe, an organization that promotes health and safety within the electronic music community, believes ravers need a safe place to play where there’s plenty of free water, pill testing and space to cool down. Sounds reasonable. But pill testing, which has been embraced by some countries, can lead to a belief that ecstasy isn’t a cause in these deaths. Even the most celebrated MDMA scientists, such as the University of California Los Angeles’ Charles Grob, say ecstasy is problematic and unpredictable in a party setting. In the past five years there have been government task forces, free water, increased security and age limits of 18 and older. In the late 00s, operators of the San Francisco Bay Area’s Cow Palace tried harm reduction and found no improvement, with multiple hospitalizations. We’re fairly liberal in California. Marijuana is on the ballot this November and is likely to be fully legalized after 20 years of pioneering medical legitimacy. The so-called godfather of ecstasy, Sasha Shulgin, was a lifelong resident. We’re not opposed to fun. The important thing to acknowledge is that MDMA has a deadly record, like alcohol, heroin and cocaine. There are only two sure solutions when it comes to saving ravers’ lives: one, don’t hold raves. That’s not going to happen, and we don’t want it to. Two, make them 21 and older. None of the 25 deaths happened at 21-and-older events. Last year, following the 2015 deaths, Hard Day of the Dead went 21-plus. Nobody died. Of course, the crowds, estimated at 20,000, were fractional. Hard Summer saw about 147,000 people through the turnstiles this year. Yes, some of the deceased over the years have been older than 21, but barely. When 20-year-old Kenani Kaimuloa died after attending EDC Vegas this year, her father, an Iraq combat veteran, told a local newspaper reporter that he had been waiting for her to come home that weekend “to give me her Father’s Day present”. If 21-and-older works, then, why isn’t it done more often? What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the drug-related deaths at electronic dance music (EDM) events, particularly raves, and the ongoing crisis these events face due to such incidents. Over the past 10 years, at least 25 drug-related deaths have occurred at parties hosted by just three Los Angeles-based rave promoters, with ecstasy (MDMA) being the common drug involved. The article highlights the importance of acknowledging the deadly record of MDMA and suggests that one potential solution for reducing drug-related deaths at these events is to make them 21-and-older only.

Write a summary based on this article: At a business roundtable that Trump and Trudeau will attend with Canadian and American female executives in Washington Monday, the two countries will launch a joint task force called the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders-Female Entrepreneurs.      Trudeau took a big step to ease that acquaintance already. Trudeau’s aides reached out to Trump’s team and pitched an event that jibes with the prime minister’s emphasis on “women in the workplace” and Ivanka Trump’s commitment to advance women’s issues like child care and maternity leave in the workplace.      Well, there’s a new guy in town now and the Canadians are working to take his measure on Monday, adjust their agenda and come to terms with the political phenomenon known as Donald Trump.      There was pomp and ceremony on the front lawn, gracious toasts at a state dinner and Trudeau and the Canadian delegation basked in the welcome laid on by President Barack Obama last March.      “That’s another world. That world is not here right now so you have to deal with a different world,” said former diplomat Paul Frazer.      It is potentially a good sign for a visit that will look very different than the very warm reception Trudeau got from the Obamas in March.      A PMO official said Trudeau had similarly advocated for the advancement of women in the workplace, especially at the executive level in China, in New York and at home and “is looking forward to being able to do this now in the White House. It seemed like a natural fit given their commitments” in Trump’s platform as well.      Frazer says no other government has better prepared for the Trump administration than Canada , reaching out even before last November’s U.S. election to forge ties with his advisers in the possibility — though rare as it seemed back then — he might win.      But that doesn’t mean this new reality is necessarily bad for Canada, he said.      Justin Trudeau says when he meets with Donald Trump on Monday he expects to talk mostly about issues the U.S. and Canada \\"align on,\\" but the prime minister says he won't avoid subjects he disagrees on with the U.S. president.      More recently, Trudeau shuffled his cabinet, dispatching foreign affairs minister Stéphane Dion to a diplomatic posting and installing Chrystia Freeland in his place, making retired army general Andrew Leslie a parliamentary secretary with special responsibility for cross-border ties and changing staff behind the scenes, all to put greater emphasis on Canada’s relations with the United States.      Freeland will join Trudeau on his Monday trip to Washington, along with Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, Transport Minister Marc Garneau and Finance Minister Bill Morneau.      “He’s done an enormous amount to get ready for this,” said Frazer, a former Canadian diplomat who now serves as a consultant in Washington.      All that has laid the groundwork for Trudeau’s Oval Office tête-à-tête with Trump. In the “bloody chaotic town” that is Washington right now, the Monday meeting offers a respite for the Trump team to latch onto something that “actually works,” Frazer said.      “Weeks into this rock and roll administration, I think the president is probably open to a little calm,” he said.      Frazer’s advice? Don’t walk in with a list of grievances or complaints about Trump’s policies, such as his controversial immigration moves, at least not for the first meeting. Lay out the argument that keeping the border open and avoiding protectionist measures will help the economy and help boost the financial fortunes of the middle class in both countries.      “Lay it out quickly. We don’t need long detailed policy memos here,” Frazer said.      “Here’s what we’ve got and it’s better than anything else in the world and how do we make it better. Let’s not do anything to screw it up,” he said.      “(Trump) responds well to facts, to a businesslike approach, kind of a roll-up-our-sleeves, ‘what is it you want, what is it I want,’ ” Frazer said.      Trudeau suggested Friday that’s the very angle he’ll be taking when he sits down with Trump.      “Relations between Canada and the United States are much deeper than just what is happening between a president and a prime minister. Obviously we’ll talk about jobs and growth for the middle class and we’ll find a lot of common ground,” the prime minister said during a visit to Yellowknife last week.      Both sides have been working on “deliverables” for the meeting, concrete commitments they can point to as evidence that the two leaders did more than just talk.      But for a first meeting, talk is important, too, especially as Trump’s early days in office have already left some world leaders unsettled, especially by his treatment of allies. The U.S. president drew fire for giving short shrift to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in a telephone call. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto scrapped his own White House visit in the continuing dispute over paying the cost of a wall along their shared border.      But Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, got a warm reception when he met with Trump Friday at the White House. Abe had met once before with Trump, travelling to his New York apartment for a pre-inauguration visit with the incoming president. Trump declared Friday that he has a “good chemistry” with the Japanese leader.      “I shook hands, but I grabbed him and hugged him because that’s the way we feel. We have a very, very good bond,” he said, adding, “I’ll let you know if it changes.”      During his joint news conference with Abe, Trump touched on themes that should encourage Canadians getting ready for their own meeting. He highlighted the importance of working together with Japan on “shared interests, of which we have many.”      “We face numerous challenges and bilateral co-operation is essential. Our country is committed to being an active and fully engaged partner,” Trump said.      “We’re going to have a tremendous relationship, long-term relationship of mutual benefit with Japan,” the president said.      That kind of language bolds well for Trudeau’s visit, who will be looking to tap similar sentiments with Trump and his cabinet team.      And as one of the first leaders in to see the U.S. president, others on the world stage will be looking to Trudeau for his impressions and advice — lessons he will be able to impart later in the week when he travels to Germany and France to meet with European politicians.      “What great timing for the Europeans to see him after he’s had his personal meeting with Trump and quietly give them a personal sense of what’s his takeaway,” Frazer said. ||||| FILE - In this Nov. 29, 2016 file photo, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau holds a press conference at the National Press Theatre in Ottawa, Ontario.

On Monday, Feb. 13, 2017, President Donald Trump... (Associated Press)      OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump will participate in a roundtable discussion about women in the work force Monday, an early sign of cooperation as Trudeau seeks to have good relations so Canada is not targeted in trade talks.      In his first face-to-face meeting with the new U.S president, Trudeau will also meet with Trump to talk about trade and participate in a working lunch.      A White House official and a senior Canadian government official said the two countries plan to launch a new task force called the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders-Female Entrepreneurs. The officials agreed to confirm the move only if they were not quoted by name because they were not authorized to make the information public.      Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter who has been an advocate for policies benefiting working women, was involved in recruiting participants and setting the agenda for the roundtable. Female executives from the United States and Canada are expected to participate.      Trudeau's close cooperation with Trump and the first daughter could ease some worries among Canadians that the U.S. president will enact protectionist measures that could hurt the Canadian economy. It could also alleviate some fears that Trump will be as combative with Trudeau as he has been with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.      The Canadian official said Trudeau's administration had suggested the task force, because the prime minister considers the issue of working women an important part of his agenda and economic growth plan.      \\"It's a smart thing if Canada proposed this,\\" said Nelson Wiseman, a professor at the University of Toronto. \\"It takes attention off of NAFTA. And from Trump's point of view, it contributes to softening Trump's image, and he's got a problem with women.\\"      Trudeau, 45, and Trump, 70, are polar opposites. Trudeau is a liberal who champions free trade and has welcomed 40,000 Syrian refugees. He calls himself a feminist and his Cabinet is 50 percent women. Trump has few women in his Cabinet. He has taken a protectionist stance on trade and wants to crack down on the inflow of migrants and refugees.      Trump's order to temporarily halt entry into the U.S. by people from seven predominantly Muslim nations, which is tied up in court, might come up during his bilateral meeting with Trudeau. But Trudeau is expected to focus on common economic interests.      Relations with the U.S. are crucial as more than 75 percent of Canada's exports go to the U.S., while 18 percent of U.S. exports go to Canada. There are fears among Canadians that they could be hurt as Trump targets Mexico in a re-negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.      Roland Paris, a former senior foreign policy to Trudeau, said the prime minister needs to build a relationship with Trump to ensure Canada is not.      \\"The overriding priority will be for Canada to maintain secure and reliable access to the U.S. market and the supply chains that crisscross the border,\\" Paris said.      Trudeau, whose father was the late Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has been preparing for the Trump meeting for months. He will also meet with legislative leaders on Capitol Hill.      ___      Associated Press writer Catherine Lucey in Washington contributed to this report. |||||","output":"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and US President Donald Trump are set to launch a new task force called the United States Canada Council for the Advancement of Women Business Leaders-Female Entrepreneurs.

Richard Lester Meyers (born October 2, 1949), better known by his stage name Richard Hell, is an American singer, songwriter, bass guitarist and writer. Richard Hell was an innovator of punk music and fashion. He was one of the first to spike his hair and wear torn, cut and drawn-on shirts, often held together with safety pins. Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, credited Hell as a source of inspiration for the Sex Pistols' look and attitude, as well as the safety-pin and graphics accessorized clothing that McLaren sold in his London shop, Sex. Richard Lester Meyers grew up in Lexington, Kentucky in 1949. His father, a secular Jew, was an experimental psychologist, researching animal behavior. He died when Hell was 7 years old. Hell was then raised by his mother, who came from Methodists of Welsh and English ancestry. After her husband's death, she returned to school and became a professor.  Hell attended the Sanford School in Delaware for one year, where he became friends with Tom Miller, who later changed his name to Tom Verlaine. They ran away from school together and a short time later were arrested in Alabama for arson and vandalism.  Hell never finished high school, instead moving to New York City to make his way as a poet. In New York he met fellow young poet David Giannini, and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico for several months, where Giannini and Meyers co-founded Genesis:Grasp. They used an AM VariTyper with changeable fonts to publish the magazine. They began publishing books and magazines, but decided to go their separate ways in 1971, after which Hell created and published Dot Books.  Before he was 21, his own poems were published in numerous periodicals, ranging from Rolling Stone to the New Directions Annuals. In 1971, along with Verlaine, Hell also published under the pseudonym Theresa Stern, a fictional poet whose photo was actually a combination of both his and Verlaine's faces in drag, superimposed over one another to create a new identity. A book of poems credited to \\"Stern\\", Wanna Go Out?, was released by Dot in 1973. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"There are definitely other interesting aspects about this article. One noteworthy aspect is Richard Hell's diverse talents and interests, which extend beyond music into poetry, writing, and publishing. A quote from the article highlighting this range of activities is: \\"Before he was 21, his own poems were published in numerous periodicals, ranging from Rolling Stone to the New Directions Annuals.\\" Additionally, the collaboration between Hell and Verlaine in creating a fictional poet, Theresa Stern, displays their creativity and willingness to challenge norms. The quote, \\"In 1971, along with Verlaine, Hell also published under the pseudonym Theresa Stern, a fictional poet whose photo was actually a combination of both his and Verlaine's faces in drag, superimposed over one another to create a new identity,\\" illustrates this unique aspect about Richard Hell's life and work. Furthermore, the article provides insights into Hell's early life, family background, and friendships that would later shape his career. This broader context helps to understand his development as an artist and his influence on the punk scene. Overall, the article not only highlights Richard Hell's musical achievements and influence on punk fashion but also delves into his multifaceted talents and personal history, adding depth to our understanding of this iconic figure in American punk culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The teenager hopes to follow her father into helping others despite his fate. She spoke as MP vote to join U.S.-led bombing campaign today. Article:","output":"Title: Dragana and Bethany Haines Support Military Force Against ISIS Introduction: The family of late aid worker David Haines, who was brutally murdered by the terrorist group ISIS, has publicly expressed their support for military force against the extremist organization. Dragana Haines, the widow of David, and their 17-year-old daughter, Bethany, have called for the complete eradication of ISIS. As MPs vote today on whether the UK should join the U.S.-led bombing campaign against ISIS, this grieving family bravely shares their story and the hope for a future where others will be saved from the fate of David Haines. David Haines' Tragic Capture and Murder: In March 2013, experienced aid worker David Haines was captured by ISIS militants in Syria. The father of two had dedicated his life to helping others, working tirelessly to improve the lives of vulnerable and suffering people in countries like Libya, Sudan, and former Yugoslavia. Tragically, in September 2014, Haines was brutally beheaded by jihadists, who proudly shared their horrific acts on the internet. His death shocked the world and marked the start of a chilling trend wherein the terrorist group executed a series of Western hostages in an attempt to instill fear and attract media attention. Family's Inspirational Response and Call for Action: Despite receiving personal threats from the terror group, Dragana Haines has maintained her courage and determination to ensure that her husband's killers are brought to justice. Both she and her daughter, Bethany, fully back the use of military force against ISIS. They have urged various governments not only to participate in the U.S.-led bombing campaign but also to collaborate in every way possible to destroy and eliminate the extremist organization. Bethany Haines has openly shared her desire to follow in her father's footsteps as a humanitarian worker, even though he endured such a cruel end. Rather than being deterred by his brutal death, the teenager remains steadfast in her mission to help those in need and work tirelessly for the betterment of societies facing severe hardship and crises such as those in Syria. UK Parliament's Vote and the Potential Impact: Today, as UK MPs vote on whether to join the U.S.-led bombing campaign against ISIS, the plight of David Haines and his family serves as a strong argument in favor of taking swift and decisive action to stamp out the terrorist group. By joining the bombing efforts of the United States and other supportive nations, the UK could help weaken ISIS, save lives, and prevent future tragedies like the one suffered by the Haines family. In Conclusion: As the world grapples with the ongoing threat of ISIS, a courageous family like Dragana and Bethany Haines, facing the repercussions of terrorism, stand in inspirational defiance to the violent and oppressive organization. It is their courage and unwavering resolve against these terrorists that epitomise the resilience of the human spirit. As we witness the strength and determination of a mother and daughter who, despite their unimaginable losses, call for the eradication of ISIS, it is essential that the international community works in unison to defeat the terrorist group. Today's vote in the UK Parliament also serves as an opportunity to take a further step towards achieving this goal where we can ensure that people like David Haines, who worked tirelessly for making the world a better place, have not given their lives in vain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Many people think boiled water is safe and good to people's health. In fact, it is not true. The boiling point of water is 100degC. By boiling it, most bacteria in water can be killed. In the past, the water was less polluted. So boiling was a good way to make clean water. But heavy metals and other dangerous things in today's water are much more terrible than bacteria. Boiling doesn't fix that problem. And boiling water may give us more of the dangerous things in our glass. 4. Never use soft drinks to take the place of water. 5. Water is also needed in winter. 6.

A Wisconsin woman who already had three children and was desperate to have one with her new boyfriend was today charged with killing a pregnant mother, cutting out her baby and passing off the child as her own. The criminal complaint filed today details the horrific story behind the murder of Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, 23, who was expecting her fourth child that she had planned to name Omar. Her alleged killer, Annette Morales-Rodriguez, admitted she. had scoured the suburban Milwaukee neighbourhood for two weeks looking for a pregnant. woman whose child she could steal and call her own. Scroll down for video. Tragedy: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz had three children and was expecting her fourth when she was savagely murdered on Thursday. On October 6, she saw Maritza Ramirez-Cruz - a total stranger - and offered her a ride. When. she got in the car, however, Morales-Rodriguez said she needed to go. back to her home to change her shoes, and Ramirez-Cruz followed her in. to use the bathroom. It. was when she came out of the toilet that Morales-Rodriguez allegedly attacked her. with a baseball bat, striking her in the head several times. With. Ramirez-Cruz on the ground, her attacker choked her until she. passed out, and cut her open, attempting a Cesaerean section that she. had seen done on the Discovery Channel, according to the complaint. Suspect: Annette Morales-Rodriguez is accused of murdering Maritza Ramirez-Cruz then savagely cutting out her unborn child. Tragedy: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, bottom left, had three children and was expecting her fourth when she was savagely murdered on Thursday. Morales-Rodriguez then hid the body in her basement. Later that evening, emergency services responded to a. call from Morales-Rodriguez, who said that she had. just given birth to a child who was not breathing, according to the. criminal complaint. Indicted: Annette Morales-Rodriguez has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder. Paramedics were unable to revive the boy and he was pronounced dead at the scene. Morales-Rodriguez was taken to the hospital but,. after an autopsy of the full-term baby - and medical examinations of the. woman herself, it was determined that she was not pregnant and had not recently given birth. Police Chief Edward Flynn said: 'During. the ensuing investigations, detectives determined that the 33-year-old. woman was not, in fact, the birth mother of the baby.' The next day, police returned to Morales-Rodriguez's home and found Ramirez-Cruz's mutilated body. The medical examiner determined that Ramirez-Cruz likely died from excessive loss of blood. Local residents and neighbours have. been shocked by the brutal killing, and many cannot believe police have. the right person in custody. On Sunday night, the victim's husband, Christian Mercado, told WTMJ that his wife was a 'good person.' Because he doesn't speak English, Mr Mercado's stepmother Darla Guiterrez translated for him. She said: 'We still can't believe it. We know it's true but we can't believe it and the whole family is taking it real hard.' Jacqueline Bonilla, whose daughter lives next-door to Morales-Rodriguez, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: 'She was acting like she was [pregnant]. Grief: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz's husband Christian Mercado is shocked by her death, and says she was a 'good person' 'She'd push her belly out and I'd say, \\"Oh, she's pregnant.\\"' Another neighbour, Keila Perez, claimed the Morales-Rodriguez is the godmother to her daughter. 'From what I know she had a baby, she had baby stuff in there, she has a car seat and everything in there. I don't know what the hell is going on.' Morales-Rodriguez lived in the property with a man and her three children, but police said no-one else is being considered as an accomplice. Neighbours said Morales-Rodriguez claimed to have been pregnant for months. Police tape: The home where Annette Morales-Rodriguez lived in suburban Milwaukee remains blocked off after police found the body of 23-year-old Maritza Ramirez-Cruz in the basement. Crime scene: The house near 7th and Mitchell streets, where Annette Morales-Rodriguez lives with her boyfriend and three children. Ms Perez said Morales-Rodriguez had been talking about pregnancy, and had even shown her a sonogram of the baby. She claimed she was expecting to deliver the baby by Caesarean section in the coming weeks but had called Ms Perez around noon on Thursday to say she was having contractions. She said the woman's three other children ranged in age from five to 14, and her current boyfriend was not their father. She added that Morales-Rodriguez had lived in the neighbourhood for seven years, after moving from Puerto Rico. Similar cases of women taking an unborn child from a mother's womb were reported in Massachusetts and Oregon in 2009, in Pennsylvania in 2007, in Illinois in 2006 and Missouri in 2004. In the Oregon case, a woman obsessed with having a baby pleaded guilty last year to the murder of a pregnant woman whose unborn child was cut from her abdomen after she was bludgeoned to death. Korena Roberts, 29, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. In Massachusetts, a Worcester woman, Julie Corey, pleaded not guilty to killing her pregnant friend, Darlene Hayes, and cutting the baby from Hayes' womb. Corey and the baby were found in a homeless shelter in Plymouth, N.H., in July 2009, just days after Hayes was found dead with a fractured skull. Disbelief: Shocked neighbours say the suspect lives with three of her children in the house where the body was found.","output":"A shocking case has emerged from Wisconsin, where a woman, Annette Morales-Rodriguez, has been charged with killing a pregnant mother, Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, and stealing her unborn child.

Information:  - A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit. Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords.  - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.  - The peso (meaning \\"weight\\" in Spanish, or more loosely \\"pound\\") was a coin that originated in Spain and became of immense importance internationally. \\"Peso\\" is now the name of the monetary unit of several former Spanish colonies.  - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency.  - Mestizo (Peninsular Spanish: , Latin American Spanish, Philippine Spanish: ) is a term traditionally used in Spain and Spanish America to mean a person of combined European and Amerindian descent, or someone who would have been deemed a Castizo (one European parent and one Mestizo parent) regardless if the person was born in Latin America or elsewhere. The term was used as an ethnic/racial category in the casta system that was in use during the Spanish Empire's control of their New World colonies. Mestizos are usually considered to be mixed Spaniards by the crown of Spain.  - Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a particular country or socio-economic context, or is easily converted to such a form. The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, sometimes, a standard of deferred payment.

Financial centres around the world function as anchors of trading between a wide range of multiple types of buyers and sellers around the clock, with the exception of weekends. The foreign exchange market does not determine the relative values of different currencies, but sets the current market price of the value of one currency as demanded against another.  - A banknote (often known as a bill, paper money, or simply a note) is a type of negotiable instrument known as a promissory note, made by a bank, payable to the bearer on demand. Banknotes were originally issued by commercial banks, who were legally required to redeem the notes for legal tender (usually gold or silver coin) when presented to the chief cashier of the originating bank. These commercial banknotes only traded at face value in the market served by the issuing bank. Commercial banknotes have primarily been replaced by national banknotes issued by central banks.  - A currency (from , \\"in circulation\\", from ) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins. A more general definition is that a currency is a \\"system of money\\" (monetary units) in common use, especially in a nation. Under this definition, US dollars, British pounds, Australian dollars, and European euros are examples of currency. These various currencies are recognized stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies. Currencies in this sense are defined by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance.  - Central America is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with South America on the southeast.

Paul Verhoeven was born on 18 July 1938, the son of a school teacher, Wim Verhoeven, and a hat maker, Nel van Schaardenburg. Although he was born in Amsterdam, the family lived in the village of Slikkerveer. In 1943 the family moved to The Hague, the location of the German headquarters in the Netherlands during World War II. The Verhoeven house was near a German military base with V1 and V2-rocket launchers, which was repeatedly bombed by allied forces. After about 20 years of working and living in the United States, Verhoeven returned to the Netherlands for the shooting of a new film. Together with his screenwriter Gerard Soeteman, Verhoeven made Black Book (2006). The director was hailed by the host of the Netherlands Film Festival with the words \\"The return of a hero.\\" Black Book eventually won six Golden Calves at this festival, including Best Director. When the shooting of Black Book was delayed due to financial issues, there was speculation about a new production. The film Beast of Bataan had been announced, but once the shooting for Black Book resumed, the other film was never realized. Since his return to European cinema in 2006 with Black Book, Verhoeven has been connected to a large number of projects, but for the moment none of them has come to fruition. Some of those titles were produced with other directors at the helm, such as The Paperboy.  Finally, in a rather unexpected twist, Verhoeven followed Black Book by directing a movie in French: Elle, an adaptation of a novel by Philippe Djian. The film by Verhoeven, a psycho-thriller where Isabelle Huppert plays a rape victim, was selected in the Official Competition at the Cannes International Film Festival, where it obtained very favourable reviews.  Verhoeven has been a knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion since 2007. In December 2016 it was announced that Verhoeven would be the President of the Jury for the 67th Berlin International Film Festival, scheduled to take place in February 2017.  In April 2017 his next French film titled Blessed Virgin was announced, to start filming in August of the same year. It is a biographical film about the life of Benedetta Carlini, which will be portrayed by Elle co-star Virginie Efira, and is an adaptation of the non-fiction book Immodest Acts - The life of a lesbian nun in Renaissance Italy by Judith C.

Cowboy drifter Jim Garry is summoned by his friend, smooth-talking Tate Riling. Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him. Eventually, Amy comes to trust (and fall in love with) Garry, especially after he defends her father from two of Riling's men.

Article: Northern Europeans spend a lot of time in their cold and cloudy winters planning their summer holidays. They are proud of their healthy color when they return home after the holiday. But they also know that a certain amount of sunshine is good for their bodies and general health. In ancient Greece people knew about the healing  powers of the sun, but this knowledge was lost. At the end of the nineteenth century a Danish doctor, Niels Finsen, began to study the effect of sunlight on certain diseases, especially diseases of the skin. He was interested not only in natural sunlight but also in artificially   produced rays. Sunlight began to play a more important part in curing sick people. A Swiss doctor, Auguste Rollier, made full use of the sun in his hospital at Lysine. Lysine is a small village high up in the Alps. The position is important: the rays of the sun with the greatest healing power are the infra-red   and ultra-violet   rays; but ultra-violet rays are too easily lost in fog and the polluted air near industrial towns. Dr. Roller found that sunlight, fresh air and good food cure a great many diseases. He was particularly successful in curing certain forms of tuberculosis with his \\"sun-cure\\". There were a large number of children in Dr. Roller's hospital. He decided to start a school where sick children could be cured and at the same time continue to learn. It was not long before his school was full. In winter, wearing only shorts, socks and boots, the children put on their skis after breakfast and left the hospital. They carried small desks and chairs as well as their school books. Their teacher led them over the snow until they reached a slope which faced the sun and was free from cold winds. There they set out their desks and chairs, and school began. Although they wore hardly any clothes, Roller's pupils were very seldom cold. That was because their bodies were full of energy which they got from the sun. But the doctor knew that sunshine can also be dangerous. If, for example, tuberculosis is...

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. For the most effective startup, focus on a particular genre to build your reputation. This focus will be determined in large part by what you wish to accomplish. If your goal is to make a lot of money, then you'll focus on popular music. If your goal is to be the go-to label for 21st century post avant jazzcore, your focus and approach will be much different. This is needed on many levels. First and foremost, you will build the framework of your label: how you plan on finding and developing talent, your marketing and promotion avenues, how you understand the market and the competition, how you plan on financing your venture, and how you intend on making this a profitable business.  If you're independently wealthy, then you may not need investors, at least for the monetary backing. However, you may wish to attract investors who can help you build credibility in your market. For example, if you started a pop music label with your own cash, but were able to convince Sir Paul McCartney to invest in your label, that would be a huge win for your label. To do that, though, you will need a credible plan that shows Sir Paul, or any other investor, that you know what you are doing. Should you need financial backing, having a plan that shows that you understand both the rewards and the risks, and that you have been able to determine a way forward, will go a long way in convincing an investor to risk his capital on your venture. That will include everything from staples to electricity to recording and production costs. Be very thorough when you do this: people who might consider becoming involved in your label will certainly be, when they read your plan! Here are some things to take into account:  Administrative costs: rent, utilities, taxes, and licenses are right up front and can be significant. Don't forget to include phone, internet, printers, paper, computers, business cards, and office supplies in this list. You will also need a website, as well as somebody to both create and maintain it. Some of these costs will be weekly, some monthly, and some that only happen every year or two. It may seem like a lot at first, but if you create a five-year plan, you should be able to chart out how these costs will eventually become a small percentage of the overall financial picture. Recording costs: as a record label, you're going to be producing acts. That means you need to account for the recording chain, including studio time, the fees for the engineer and producer (which may be you, but you need to get paid too), mixing engineers, and studio musicians. Marketing budget: a great recording is nothing until it's actually in the market. To do that, you're going to need to promote your label through online ads, magazine ads, press releases, and your website. You will also need to work with artists and designers to create your logo, packaging standards, and overall design plan. Professional services: while you're busy making beautiful music, somebody needs to take care of writing clear, effective legal contracts both for your talent, and for your business deals. For that, you will want the services of a qualified attorney who specializes in the music business. You'll also want an accountant to make sure that you friendly tax collector doesn't come to call. You need people that you can trust and rely on. Planning a cash flow forecast for one, three, and five years out requires some skill, some savvy, and some educated guesswork. The first year should be a very solid plan: you will have a good idea of your startup costs already, and you will likely have in mind (and made contact with) a few bands who will be the first on your roster. Using this information, determine how much you'll be spending, and a projection about how much these acts will bring in.  For example, you can base this on how the bands are doing currently: Do they pack clubs? Their music has a good track record, and will probably perform well. If you also have bands that are brand new, and don't have a fan base to work from, you'll have to do significantly more promotion to get the word out. As you add more bands to your roster, your income potential will continue to grow. As you plan for years three to five in your forecast, you will need to determine how and when you will add more talent, and how you will promote them. This is where prediction gets a little more complicated: a great band on your roster may make it much easier for you to promote all the bands on your roster. Similarly, a poorly-performing band will be a cash drain that can lead to financial struggles. Unless you're supremely talented in sales, marketing, music, business, art, conversation, and moonlight as a lawyer, you're going to want to develop a team. Here are some key skill sets that will enable your success:  Marketing and sales: somebody who can get out there and promote your label, who knows the industry, and has a  personal relationship with artists, promoters, and people who like to support the arts financially. This person or persons will be key to your success: they're responsible for bringing talent in, and getting the word out. The better they perform, the more successful you'll be. Production. You'll need somebody who understands the recording process inside and out, who can find or develop good engineers, mixers, and producers, and who can run a recording session. Contract help. To keep costs down, at least at first, consider hiring other staff on a per-job basis. This would include logo and graphic design, legal, accounting, engineering, and other needs that only occur from time to time. Summary:","output":"1. Determine your focus and goal for the label, which will guide your approach. 2.

Write an article based on this summary: Two-year-old Alice does not like meat and only eats broccoli with ketchup, but scientists researching toddlers' eating habits do not blame her parents.","output":"Title: Tackling Toddler Eating Habits: Beyond Parenting Introduction Two-year-old Alice may not like meat and prefer her broccoli with a side of ketchup, but according to recent scientific research, her eating habits should not be seen as a reflection of her parents' culinary skills or parenting approach. In this article, we dive into the fascinating world of toddlers' eating habits and investigate the reasons behind their peculiar preferences, dietary challenges faced by parents, and strategies to encourage a well-rounded diet. Understanding the Picky Eater When toddlers begin their journey into the world of solid foods, their taste buds can be quite unpredictable. Vegetables smothered in cheese or fruits dipped in yogurt might become a favorite, while meat might be met with disdain. In many cases, parents are not to blame for their children's preferences. Researchers suggest that taste preferences may be formed in infancy, which means that what babies were exposed to during their first months of life could play a role in their likes and dislikes. Genetics, too, can influence a child's taste preferences. Some children may have a higher sensitivity to bitter flavors, which is why they may avoid vegetables like broccoli or sprouts, while some may be more drawn to sweet flavors, leading to a preference for fruits or treats. The Role of Environment and Culture Environmental factors also play a huge part in shaping a child's taste preferences and eating habits. Cultural norms, family customs, and regional cuisines contribute to the types of foods that toddlers are exposed to. For instance, a child who grows up in a Mediterranean household is more likely to develop a taste for olives, tomatoes, and fish compared to a child growing up in a more meat-centric American household. In addition to this, toddlers, in general, enjoy imitating others in their environment, which significantly influences their food choices. When they observe family members, friends, and peers enjoying a particular food, they are more likely to try it themselves. Strategies to Encourage Better Eating Habits Acknowledging that toddlers' eating habits are not solely a consequence of parenting can help pave the way for more creative and effective strategies in cultivating healthier eating behaviors. 1. Repeated exposure: Patience and persistence are key when introducing new foods to a toddler. It may take multiple attempts, sometimes over a month, before a toddler feels comfortable enough to consistently accept a new food. The trick is to repeatedly expose them to a variety of foods in a pressure-free environment. 2. Presentation matters: Toddlers are often more inclined to try foods if they are presented in an appealing manner. This could involve cutting up fruits or vegetables in fun shapes, arranging them colorfully on the plate, or coming up with creative names. 3. Involvement in meal preparation: Young children who help prepare meals may be more interested in trying the foods they've helped to create. Activities like washing fruits and vegetables, stirring, or putting toppings on a dish can all engage a toddler in meal preparation. 4. Encourage family meals: Eating together as a family helps to create healthy eating habits, as well as a sense of routine and comfort in trying new foods. Toddlers learn by observing their family members and may be more likely to partake in eating a meal when they see others enjoying it. 5. Addressing sensory concerns: Some toddlers may not like certain foods because of their texture or appearance. In such cases, it may help to modify the food's texture, like blending it, altering the cooking method, or mixing it with other familiar foods. Conclusion In conclusion, it is essential for parents not to feel discouraged, nor blame themselves or their culinary prowess for their toddlers' eccentric eating habits. Evidence suggests that several factors can contribute to a child's food preferences, including genetics, early infancy exposure, environment, and cultural norms. By incorporating patience, creativity, and a variety of approaches, parents can help introduce their toddlers to a diverse and healthy array of foods. Remember, like the story of Alice, even if broccoli is only enjoyed with a dollop of ketchup, the key is to appreciate the colorful journey through the culinary world with your little ones."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The water inside the bucket could possibly have a slight curve.

The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent.

Plot title: Babes in Toyland Movie plot: Lisa Piper (Drew Barrymore), an eleven-year-old girl from Cincinnati, Ohio, takes care of her siblings and cooks for her family. She has no time for toys, and refuses to be treated as a child. During a blizzard on Christmas Eve, Lisa is transported to Toyland. She arrives just before Mary Contrary (Jill Schoelen) is to be wedded to the unpleasant Barnaby Barnacle (Richard Mulligan), although Mary loves Barnaby's nephew, Jack Nimble (Keanu Reeves). Lisa stops the wedding and, with her new friends, finds out that Barnaby plans to take over Toyland. Lisa, Mary, Jack, and Georgie Porgie (Googy Gress) go to the kindly Toymaster (Pat Morita) for help, but he can only help them if Lisa really believes in toys. Barnaby confronts them and the Toymaster, finally showing his true colors, and steals a flask containing distilled evil that the Toymaster had been collecting, before leaving Lisa and company to be eaten by Trollog, a vulture-like monster with a single enchanted eye that Barnaby uses to spy on his enemies. They escape by blinding Trollog with paint and locking him in a chest, but are captured and imprisoned one by one in Barnaby's hidden fortress. Barnaby reveals that he had been creating an army of trolls to take over Toyland, and then attempts to corrupt his captives into being his servants with the contents of the flask, stating he would replace Trollog with Lisa and make Mary his Troll Princess. Lisa, however, proves to be immune to the evil, and manages to reverse the effects on her friends. After escaping from Barnaby's stronghold, they return to the Toymaster. When Barnaby unleashes his army of trolls upon Toyland, Lisa's newfound belief animates an army of life-sized toy soldiers that the Toymaster had created, and they drive Barnaby into the Forest of the Night. Barnaby, having lost control of his creatures and having failed at making Lisa his new Trollog, is then banished from Toyland. Jack and Mary are then married.

These actions included stopping a forced wedding, escaping from Barnaby's clutches multiple times, including from his hidden fortress, countering Barnaby's attempt to corrupt them using a flask of distilled evil, seeking help from the Toymaster/Santa Claus, and ultimately, with the belief of Lisa Piper as the catalyst, animating a life-sized army of toy soldiers to defend Toyland from an army of trolls engineered by Barnaby.

I can use this background: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing.  Now, I have a new situation: Jeremy works on a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine. Jeremy is frequently exposed to sounds with high decibel levels due to being around these machines so often. Jeremy's brother, Alexander, on the other hand works in a library. Unlike Jeremy, Alexander is frequently exposed to sounds with very low decibel levels during his work.  Answer this question please: Who is exposed to sounds that are more dangerous? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, we will consider the given background information and the new situation to determine which individual is exposed to more dangerous sounds. Step 1: Understand the relationship between decibel levels and sound intensity. As mentioned in the background, for every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. High-decibel sounds have more intensity and are potentially damaging to the ears and can cause hearing loss. Step 2: Consider the working environments of Jeremy and Alexander. Jeremy works on a construction site operating a jackhammer and a large welding machine. These machines are known to produce high-decibel sounds. Alexander works in a library, where he is frequently exposed to low-decibel sounds. Step 3: Compare the sound exposure of Jeremy and Alexander. Jeremy is exposed to high-decibel sounds in his work environment. Meanwhile, Alexander is exposed to low-decibel sounds in his work environment. High-decibel sounds are dangerous, as mentioned in the background information. Step 4: Determine who has a higher risk of exposure to dangerous sounds. Since Jeremy is exposed to high-decibel sounds due to operating heavy machinery in his work environment, he is more likely to be exposed to dangerous sounds that could damage his ears and cause hearing loss.

Given the question: Information:  - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).  - Sonata (Italian: , pl. \\"sonate\\"; from Latin and Italian: \\"sonare\\", \\"to sound\\"), in music, literally means a piece \\"played\\" as opposed to a cantata (Latin and Italian \\"cantare\\", \\"to sing\\"), a piece \\"sung\\". The term evolved through the history of music, designating a variety of forms until the Classical era, when it took on increasing importance, and is vague. By the early 19th century, it came to represent a principle of composing large-scale works. It was applied to most instrumental genres and regardedalongside the fugueas one of two fundamental methods of organizing, interpreting and analyzing concert music. Though the musical style of sonatas has changed since the Classical era, most 20th- and 21st-century sonatas still maintain the same structure.  - A Scots Quair is a trilogy by the Scottish writer Lewis Grassic Gibbon , describing the life of Chris Guthrie , a woman from the north east of Scotland during the early 20th century . It consists of three novels : Sunset Song ( 1932 ) , Cloud Howe ( 1933 ) , and Grey Granite ( 1934 ) . The first is widely regarded as an important classic ( voted Scotland 's favourite book in a 2005 poll supported by the Scottish Book Trust and other organisations ) but opinions are more varied about the other two .  - A trilogy (from Greek - \\"\\", \\"three\\" and - \\"-logia\\", \\"discourse\\") is a set of three works of art that are connected, and that can be seen either as a single work or as three individual works. They are commonly found in literature, film, or video games. Three-part works that are considered components of a larger work also exist, such as the triptych or the three-movement sonata, but they are not commonly referred to with the term \\"trilogy.\\"  - Lewis Grassic Gibbon was the pseudonym of James Leslie Mitchell (13 February 1901  7 February 1935), a Scottish writer.

They do n't spend money on consumer goods at Wal - Mart and Target . They tend to save their money . Question: Am I in support of tax breaks for the wealthy ?","output":"Based on your statements, it is clear that you are not in support of tax breaks for the wealthy. You have expressed your disagreement with the benefits that tax breaks for the wealthy are supposed to provide to the economy. You believe that since the wealthy do not tend to spend their money on consumer goods at stores such as Wal-Mart and Target, their tax breaks do not have a meaningful impact on economic growth. Furthermore, you have mentioned your dissatisfaction with the current state of financial assistance provided by the government, specifically the 600 stimulus checks. This implies that you believe more support should be offered to those who may be in need of it, rather than giving tax breaks to wealthier individuals who may not be investing that money back into the economy in a meaningful way. In addition, it is important to understand that individuals have different opinions on the effectiveness and fairness of tax breaks for the wealthy. Many argue that these tax breaks are essential for encouraging businesses to grow and create jobs, which can subsequently lead to economic growth. On the other hand, others argue that such tax breaks only serve to widen the wealth gap and cause socioeconomic disparities, as those with higher incomes might have a greater capacity to save and invest their additional income, rather than spending it on consumer goods or other activities that could stimulate the economy. It is evident from your statements that you side with the latter argument, believing that tax breaks for the wealthy do not provide sufficient economic benefits to warrant their existence. Instead, you might propose solutions such as increasing financial assistance to those in need, or advocating for policies that ensure a fairer distribution of wealth and resources within society. This could involve progressive tax policies, social safety nets, or investments in education and workforce development to create opportunities for economic mobility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since the lungs are functioning normally, the oxygen exchange between the alveoli and the capillaries is not hindered, allowing for proper gas exchange. The walls of the alveoli are intact, and there is no narrowing or blockage in the airways, which contributes to a more effective oxygen transfer, and ultimately more oxygen reaching the bloodstream. As for the supposed perturbation and its influence on the second effect (oxygen going into the bloodstream), if the person does not have COPD, there would likely be no perturbation or negative effect on the oxygen delivery to the blood. Instead, the person's respiratory system would function as expected, enabling a greater amount of oxygen to reach the blood and thus having a positive impact on overall oxygenation levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Review: After reading the previous comments, I'm just glad that I wasn't the only person left confused, especially by the last 20 minutes. John Carradine is shown twice walking down into a grave and pulling the lid shut after him. I anxiously awaited some kind of explanation for this odd behavior...naturally I assumed he had something to do with the evil goings-on at the house, but since he got killed off by the first rising corpse (hereafter referred to as Zombie #1), these scenes made absolutely no sense. Please, if someone out there knows why Carradine kept climbing down into graves -- let the rest of us in on it!! All the action is confined to the last 20 minutes so I'll attempt a synopsis. John Carradine comes out to the cemetery to investigate, and is throttled by Zombie #1. So far, so good. But then we get the confusing scene where John Ireland and Jerry Strickler, out for a little moonlight filming in the graveyard, discover Carradine's dead body. Strickler repeatedly tries to push Ireland into the open grave from whence Zombie #1 had emerged, but Ireland succeeds in flipping him into the open grave instead, and PRESTO! Strickler comes out as Zombie #2! Yeah, I guess we can infer that Strickler was dead all-along (a witch?), but why he changed from normal appearance into rotting-flesh version by flying into Zombie #1's grave is never explained. (Considering how excruciatingly slow-moving these zombies are, I'd of thought he would have preferred to stay in his \\"normal\\" form until his business was concluded). This scene also brings a question to mind -- just who the heck IS Zombie #1 ??? We can only assume Zombie #1 is one of the original murder victims shown during the movie's opening credits, but who knows which one, nor why he has a particular grudge against the film crew.Anyway, after Ireland sees this transformation and runs away, we see the EXACT SAME SHOT of Zombie #2 shambling through the trees as we saw for Zombie #1. (This leads to momentary confusion over just how MANY zombies there really are). Then in best 1950's horror-movie fashion Ireland manages to trip while fleeing. He conveniently knocks his head on the small headstone of Faith Domergue's dead cat (wasn't that nice of John Carradine to chisel a tombstone for a cat that he barely knew?)Meanwhile, Zombie #1 has been wrecking havoc up at the house. He easily dispatches three film-crew members, then starts up the stairs. Faith Domergue hears him, and thinking it's lover John Ireland back from his night-shoot, goes out. Upon seeing it's only Zombie #1, she lets out a scream and retreats into a bedroom where she retrieves Ireland's revolver. While starlet Carole Wells is showering at this point and can't hear the scream, her co-star Charles Macauley (who's boozing and hamming it up at a mirror in his bedroom) does. Taking his sweet time (and only after some more swigs from his hip-flask) he finally decides to investigate. (One thing that strikes the viewer during the last quarter of this movie is how SLOW TO REACT the stars are to screams and gunshots). Domergue comes back out into the hallway armed and ready, but mistakes Macauley for Zombie #1 and shoots him six times! He does a nice acrobatic flip over the railing, then a horrified Domergue backs up, right into the waiting arms of Zombie #1.Carole Wells is by now out of her shower and drying off when she hears gunshots and Domergue's screams; she too feels no great urgency in running out to investigate. So during this time Zombie #1 has time to string Domergue up from the neck with a rope. Wells sees Domergue's hanging corpse and faints dead-away. The next time we see her is in a stream outside the house (???) -- but more on that later. Meantime, Ireland has recovered his senses and stumbles into the house where he discovers Zombie #1's bloody carnage. Though Ireland has just stumbled upon 3 murdered people he's more concerned that his film has been exposed and ruined! Mercifully for him (and the audience), Zombie #1 throws some movie equipment down on his head from the 2nd floor. That's the last we see of Zombie #1. At this point the audience is treated to a montage of all the deaths, showing that the new ones \\"mirror\\" the old ones. How profound.Zombie #2, meanwhile, has gotten near the house (remember, these zombies move as slow as molasses in January) where he happens to see Carole Wells floating by in a stream, and fishes her out. How did she get there? Did Zombie #1 carry her down, throw her in, then zoom back upstairs just in time to crush John Ireland? Apparently one of the original victims was drowned in the tub, so Wells has to drown too (but why outside in a stream, instead of in the tub, is never explained). Zombie #2 never makes it into the house himself (everyone's dead by now, anyways, thanks to Zombie #1) but instead he carries Carol Wells back to the graveyard. As the end credits flash on screen, we see Zombie #2 with his dead love still in his arms, descending into the open grave.The viewer is left wondering: Yes, but wasn't this Zombie #1's grave? Why is Zombie #2 taking up residence? And what if Zombie #1 comes along and wants to climb back in -- is Zombie #2 gonna let him, or will there be a zombie fight? Will the zombies share both the grave and the newly deceased Carole Wells? And what about now-dead John Carradine -- where's he gonna stay? After all, from the earlier scenes we know he's clearly at home in the grave... If this plot synopsis of the finale has left you confused, don't worry cause you're not alone. Question: is it a negative review? A:","output":"Yes, this is a negative review. The reviewer expresses confusion regarding the plot, a lack of explanation for some characters' behaviors, a lack of urgency in the characters' actions despite life-threatening circumstances, and seemingly illogical scenes. The reviewer also questions the logic behind a zombie's transformation process, the identity of certain zombies, and the residency of a grave. There are significant criticisms about the film and no positive comments made about it, which suggests a negative sentiment towards the movie."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The author of the tweet starts by describing their current situation, sitting in the waiting room, waiting for someone named Boogz. This statement is neutral, simply setting the scene for the reader. However, the author's feeling of tiredness is expressed in the next sentence with \\"i'm super tired!\\" The use of 'super' in this context serves to emphasize the extent of the author's fatigue. The author then follows up on this sentiment of tiredness by mentioning that they don't think they will go into the control room when they arrive at the \\"stu\\", which is presumably a shorthand term for 'studio'. This reinforces the level of exhaustion or lack of energy the author is experiencing, as they are not just physically tired, but also feeling unenthusiastic about their upcoming task or activity. Additionally, the use of the casual language, informal contractions, and shorthand adds a sense of spontaneity to the tweet, reflecting the author's mood, and possibly suggesting impatience as they await Boogz's arrival.

Step 1: Analyze the context Jordan got ill yesterday and had to be admitted into the hospital, missing work today. Step 2: Evaluate the possible answers, relating them to the context a) Very happy to miss work: This answer seems unlikely because Jordan was ill and had to be admitted to the hospital. It would be more plausible if Jordan wasn't truly sick or was avoiding a responsibility at work. b) In pain: This answer is more likely, given that Jordan was ill and required hospitalization.

A:","output":"The suggested answer partially addresses the question, but it does not provide a comprehensive and detailed explanation of what happened to the Kuomintang (KMT) after the Chinese Civil War. A more thorough answer could be as follows: The Kuomintang (KMT), also known as the Chinese Nationalist Party, faced a significant defeat after the Chinese Civil War, which lasted from 1927 to 1950, with a brief pause during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). The civil war was primarily fought between the KMT, led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communist Party of China (CPC), led by Mao Zedong. The KMT was defeated, and the People's Republic of China (PRC) was established by the CPC on October 1, 1949. After its defeat, the KMT, along with Chiang Kai-shek, retreated to the island of Taiwan. The Republic of China (ROC) government, originally founded by the KMT in 1912, relocated to Taiwan and continued to consider itself the legitimate government of all of China. Chiang Kai-shek and his party ruled Taiwan under martial law from 1949 until 1987, when his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, lifted martial law and allowed the formation of opposition parties. This marked the beginning of Taiwan's transition to a democratic government. The Kuomintang, despite losing its political dominance over China, survived and continued to play a significant role in the politics of Taiwan. The party has participated in elections and governed Taiwan during various periods since 1987, most recently through the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou (2008-2016). As for the relationship between the PRC and the ROC (Taiwan), both governments have a \\"One-China policy,\\" which refers to their mutual acknowledgment that there is only one sovereign state encompassing both mainland China and Taiwan, but with disagreement over which government is the legitimate representative of this state. Due to this policy, other countries can only maintain official diplomatic relations with either the PRC or the ROC, not both. Cross-strait relations have experienced periods of tension and relative peace, often fluctuating based on election outcomes in Taiwan and the strength of political ideologies advocating for Taiwanese independence or reunification with the mainland. In summary, it would be more accurate to validate an answer that addresses the retreat of the Kuomintang to Taiwan, the subsequent governance of the island, the development of democracy, and the role of the KMT in Taiwan's contemporary politics, in addition to the impact of cross-strait relations on the political and military situations in both Taiwan and the PRC."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Demonstrators took their shouts for an end to what they say is widespread and unchecked police brutality to an NBA arena in Washington, a famed department store in New York, a well-known Ivy League commercial spot and to roads where they often brought traffic and passersby to a stop. Streets in major cities throughout the United States -- Boston, Chicago, Miami and New Orleans, among them -- filled again Friday night with protesters. And while crowds appeared to be smaller than previous nights, marchers were just as passionate about their voices being heard. One sign held by a young black man in Washington read simply: \\"I could be next.\\" The protests are a response to the decision Wednesday by a New York grand jury not to charge police Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the chokehold death of Eric Garner during his Staten Island arrest, which was captured on cell phone video. They come a week after another decision not to indict by a grand jury in St. Louis County, Missouri, examining the killing of African-American teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer. In New York, protesters in the rain passed out a list of demands to the media regarding the Garner death in July. The top demands were for all officers involved to be fired, for a special prosecutor to be appointed to investigate all complaints of excessive force and for the state Legislature to make a chokehold punishable by significant penalties. A die-in at Macy's. Earlier, Eric Garner's daughter Erica told CNN's \\"The Lead with Jake Tapper\\" that she wanted to see people punished for her father's killing. \\"Justice to me is basically doing what's right,\\" she said. \\"I wouldn't be happy with (Pantaleo) just losing his job or being suspended or still getting paid. I wouldn't want that. I would want him to face time in jail.\\" She said that anyone who contributed to her father's death should go to prison. Protesters flooded Macy's iconic Herald Square location and staged a die-in as holiday shoppers looked on. Later, the flood of demonstrators shut off Times Square to traffic for 10 minutes before the crowd headed down 42nd Street, shouting, \\"This is what democracy looks like.\\" They stopped again in Bryant Park and ringed a set of shops. Many of the workers in those stores came out and, in support, raised their hands in the air. It was also a short stop, as the crowd set off up Sixth Avenue, traversing against the flow of yellow cabs and other cars. A cacophony of car horns greeted the protesters and cabbies also held their hands out the window to give their approval. Only about 50 people protested in Chicago, but they marched with few breaks for hours. In Washington, the demonstrators held several four-minute long silent die-ins to empathize with the family of Michael Brown, a Missouri teenager who lie in the street for four hours after he was fatally shot by a police officer. \\"I'm not an angry black man. I'm an outraged, hurt black man,\\" one of the protest organizers told CNN. Six protesters shouted \\"Hands up, don't shoot\\" inside the Verizon Center before an NBA game between the Washington Wizards and the Denver Nuggets. Near Boston -- site of one of the largest demonstrations of the night -- a mass of protesters staged a die-in, several dozen of them blocking an intersection by lying on the road. As many as 1,000 people were marching Friday evening from Tufts University in Somerville, Massachusetts, near Boston to Harvard Square, according to a police estimate. \\"People who don't already realize what is happening, maybe they will open their minds a little bit or people that do realize and don't care will realize that people are angry and it's not OK,\\" Nicole, a Boston demonstrator who wouldn't give her last name, told CNN affiliate WHDH when asked why she marches. 'So many people realize this is a problem' Those who turned out to protest were a mix of ages and races. Chuck Helms, a 67-year-old New Jersey resident, marched in New York clad in a union-issue hard hat and satin Occupy Wall Street jacket. A sign dangling around his neck said, \\"Remembering my brothers. BLACK LIVES MATTER.\\" The sign included photographs of Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice and Akai Gurley -- all black men whose controversial deaths made headlines. Gurley was shot dead last month by a police officer in a dark stairwell of a New York housing project. Brooklyn DA: Grand jury to investigate shooting of unarmed man. \\"It's a shame that people have to die for us to become focused,\\" Helms said. At least two people in New York were detained by police, who will not report on arrests until Saturday morning. In Chicago, Elizabeth Huston, a paralegal, joined in for the first time. \\"So many people realize this is a problem. This is disproportionally affecting black men and women,\\" she said. In Cleveland, protesters there marched over the death of Tamir, 12, who police say had a lifelike air gun and didn't comply with an officer's commands. \\"CPD what do you say? How many kids have you killed today,\\" they yelled. Cleveland cop who shot 12-year-old slammed for 'immaturity' in past job. The family of Tamir filed a wrongful death suit Friday against police over the killing, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. Growing movement. The demand for change in how law enforcement deals with minorities has been broad, with protests involving untold thousands of demonstrators from coast to coast, in towns both large and small. \\"It's happening in every city, every town. It's happening here in Pittsburgh,\\" Julia Johnson told CNN affiliate WPXI on Thursday. In many ways, it appears to be based on the Occupy Wall Street movement, which generated protests in New York and elsewhere in 2011 over inequality, corporate influence and other issues. The largely leaderless and underground movement is using social media to organize protests, which have morphed from a wide-ranging agenda to a tight focus on the issue of police violence against black men. The mostly peaceful protests shared many similarities with the protests of the Civil Rights era -- marches, signs, civil disobedience. One Asian-American protester felt inspired by the 1960s marches, but said she believes that struggle shows change will take a long time. \\"If you think about the civil rights movement, it took 10 years for anything to happen between the protests and the boycotts of the buses to the actual Civil Rights Act,\\" she said. Author and CNN commentator Michaela Angela Davis was marching in a mixed crowd of mostly white students chanting \\"black lives matter.\\" The blocked streets didn't bother her so much. It's democracy, she said. \\"I feel like we are seeing the American project at work. It is messy; it is difficult.\\" NYC officials: Fewer complaints against police. Meanwhile, New York officials said that complaints against police officers had fallen significantly in the second half of the year, compared with July to November 2013. A report that tallied complaints said 1,813 were made so far since July 1 of this year, 26% less than the number of complaints filed with the Civilian Complaint Review Board in the same period of the prior year. Excessive force allegations fell by 29%. The dip followed a slight rise in the first six months of the year, but, overall, allegations have declined in 2014. \\"Over the past 11 months, my administration has implemented a series of initiatives and reforms aimed at bridging the gap between the NYPD and the communities they serve,\\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a written statement. \\"From ending the overuse of stop and frisk, to dropping the city's legal challenge to the racial profiling ban, to changing the department's policy on possession of small amounts of marijuana, we're steadily bringing crime down while drawing police and community closer together.\\" CNN's Ray Sanchez reported from New York, Athena Jones reported from Washington and Steve Almasy reported and wrote in Atlanta.

Answer:","output":"The last step of the process would likely be the collection of the separated components, namely the desalinated water and the salt, for their respective uses or further processing.

This purified water can then be carefully collected from the second container and stored, distributed, or used for various purposes, such as irrigation, drinking water, or industrial applications. Simultaneously, the salt particles left behind in the first container after the water has evaporated can also be collected.

I read some of the bad reviews about Elements, and felt I needed to chime in.  Went there last night before a show as well as some of the other reviewers have.  My parents who are foodies and have dined all over the US and outside of the US also recommended this place.  Our experience was amazing.    First, the environment.  While it is in a non-traditional location, the openness and modern decor of the restaurant is refreshing.  The open fire oven makes it feel warm.  We sat in one of the \\"booths\\" by the windows, and they were so comfortable.    The service and waiter we had were awesome.  Robert was very knowledgeable about the food and gave us fantastic recommendations for our dinner choices.  We did get there early, but we also like to take our time to dine, so those who need a rush may not want to go here based on others' reviews.    Now the most important part:  THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC.  We started with a 6 selection cheese and meat plate.  We trusted Robert to make these selections, and he did not disappoint.  We had the duck speck, salami tartufo, and pate ciccioli.  I am unable to remember the cheeses we had, but I do remember they are all pennsylvania cheeses and were delicious.  I had the brussel sprouts for a salad, and the veal cheek.  My partner had the greens salad and filet, which he absolutely loved.  I am going to stick to reviewing my dishes.  The brussel sprouts were fantastic.  Surprisingly tart, they were mixed with bacon and grapes and had a drier ricotta that almost tasted like feta.  It was perhaps one of the best brussel sprouts dishes I've ever tasted.  And onto the the veal cheek.  I love veal, and until last night, the best veal I've had was at a restaurant in Florence.  This veal was unbelievably tender, and melted like butter in the mouth.  I honestly didn't want the dish to end.  Unfortunately, because all of the meat is local, Robert told us this dish will be gone in about two weeks.  So if you go here, please PLEASE order the veal.  You won't regret it.  We finished the meal with the chocolate mousse and pecan pie and some coffee.  They were both very good, but honestly, I just couldn't stop thinking about the veal I had just eaten, so they didn't get as much of my attention.    All in all, it's probably one of the best meals I've had in Pittsburgh (before moving to Chicago, I lived in Pgh for 4 years and grew up in the area.) All the food is amazingly fresh, and you can definitely tell.  It is absolutely Chicago-worthy, and would do very well there.  If you want to enjoy a leisure meal and savor all of the flavors, I think you will absolutely be glad you made the choice to dine here.  I'm looking forward to my next visit.

What is the sentiment of the following review? WinCo is fairly close to me and my dad was really excited they were coming to the East Valley, and especially near where we live.  However, the prices aren't all that inexpensive.  However, they have a reasonably good bulk section, which is why we come here and their prices for some of their deli stuff is better than Safeway, which is usually where we go for things like chicken strips, fried chicken, wedges.  WinCo's stuff tastes good and it's much better pricing for that.  We buy protein powder and it's about 3-4/lb less than Sprouts for their whey protein.  We love that they carry spices in bulk, and you can get what you want, which saves us money, too.  Everyone that we've dealt with at WinCo has been super friendly and helpful.  The store is spacious and clean.    The only downside is that some of their prices are competitive, but since they have no weekly ads, it's hard for them to compete with Frys and the stores that sometimes have killer weekly specials.  If they did do this, then they might attract even more customers.  Even though they have a thing that says you can buy in bulk without the membership fees, Costco still does have better pricing on a number of things that far surpasses the extra pricing you would pay for a basic membership at Costco.

If he did not have a will, Minnesota law states that his estate would go to his sister, Tyka Nelson, and his seven half siblings. Two are believed to have passed away.      Tax attorney Bruce Givner, who is not affiliated with Prince’s estate, told IE his money will go his siblings.      “Minnesota, like every state, has what is called an intestacy law. Intestacy meaning there is no governing document. The state has a law that says who gets it when you die,” he said.      “Minnesota says when there is no spouse, when there are no children, when there are no parents, it goes to the heirs of the grandparents. So, this is going to be split among his siblings.\\"      Prince is believed to own the master recordings of his work, and ran the successful record label, NPG and his Paisley Park recording studio.

Watch: The World Sees Purple in Tribute to Prince ||||| CHANHASSEN, Minn. — Prince Rogers Nelson had an unflinching reputation among those close to him for leading an assiduously clean lifestyle. He ate vegan and preferred to avoid the presence of meat entirely. He was known to eschew alcohol and marijuana, and no one who went on tour with him could indulge either.      But Prince appears to have shielded from even some of his closest friends that he had a problem with pain pills, one that grew so acute that his friends sought urgent medical help from Dr. Howard Kornfeld of California, who specializes in treating people addicted to pain medication.      Dr. Kornfeld, who runs a treatment center in Mill Valley, Calif., sent his son on an overnight flight to meet with Prince at his home to discuss a treatment plan, said William J. Mauzy, a lawyer for the Kornfeld family, during a news conference on Wednesday outside his Minneapolis office.      But he arrived too late.      When the son, Andrew Kornfeld, who works with his father but is not a doctor, arrived in Chanhassen, the Minneapolis suburb where Prince lived, the next morning, he was among those who found the entertainer lifeless in the elevator and called 911, Mr. Mauzy said. Emergency officials arrived but could not revive Prince. He was dead at 57. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Speculation surrounds who will inherit Prince's estimated 300 million fortune, as it is unclear if he had a will.

Which game has more players Spy Alley or Onyx?","output":"To determine which game has more players – Spy Alley or Onyx – I will provide you with an overview of both games, taking into account their popularity, player count, and potential factors that might influence the number of players. 1. Spy Alley:  Spy Alley is a board game designed by Bill Stephenson and published in 1992. The game is a mix of deduction, bluffing, and strategy where players assume the roles of spies belonging to different countries, trying to collect a set of items and return to their home base without revealing their identity. Spy Alley is designed for 2-6 players aged 8 and up, with an average playtime of 45 minutes. Popularity: Spy Alley has been well-received by players and has won several awards in the past, including the 1998 National Parenting Publication Awards (NAPPA) for games. It also has a ranking of 7.0 on BoardGameGeek, indicating that it is a well-regarded game within the board gaming community. 2. Onyx:  After extensive research, I couldn't find relevant information on a board game called Onyx. Nevertheless, there is a popular abstract strategy game called \\"Onitama\\" that might be worth considering if it was a typo or a confusion. Alternatively, \\"Onyx\\" could be a lesser-known game or a game still in development that isn't widely available to the public. Assuming you were referring to Onitama, here's a brief overview: Onitama is a two-player abstract strategy game designed by Shimpei Sato and published in 2014. Players control a master pawn and four other pawns representing martial arts students on a 5x5 grid. The objective is to either capture the opponent's master pawn or move your master pawn to the opponent's starting position. Onitama is a highly strategic game with simple mechanics and an average playtime of 15-20 minutes. Popularity: Onitama has earned a strong reputation in the board gaming community, garnering a rating of 7.6 on BoardGameGeek. Additionally, it has received several awards and nominations, such as the 2016 Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Nominee, indicating that it is a popular and appreciated game. Conclusion:  Considering the available information, it's challenging to make a direct comparison due to the lack of information on a game named \\"Onyx.\\" Nevertheless, Spy Alley seems to have a larger player base due to its higher player count (2-6 players) in comparison to Onitama, which is only for two players. Additionally, Spy Alley has a broader appeal, catering to family audiences while Onitama has a more niche appeal, targeting fans of abstract strategy games. However, I highly recommend looking into more accurate current information on the potential game called \\"Onyx\\" if that was the intended choice. In case it was Onitama, the information presented should give a clearer comparison, with Spy Alley potentially having a larger player base due to the mentioned factors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Cobol, Basic, and Fortran are types of programming languages. These languages are essential tools for creating software programs, managing databases, and performing various computational tasks. Each of these programming languages emerged in the mid-twentieth century and have played significant roles in the evolution of computer programming as we know it today. Their unique features and characteristics have made them suitable for specific purposes and fields, even though their popularity has diminished over the decades. Let's explore each one in a bit more detail: 1. Cobol (COmmon Business-Oriented Language):  Cobol is a high-level, procedural programming language specifically designed for business applications. The language was developed in 1959 by a group of programming experts, led by Grace Hopper, under the sponsorship of the United States Department of Defense. Cobol's primary purpose was to facilitate the processing of data and mathematical operations in sectors such as finance, human resources, and inventory management. Cobol is recognized for its English-like syntax, which makes it relatively easy to read, write, and maintain. The language is highly scalable and is known for its ability to process large amounts of data in a structured manner. Although Cobol has lost popularity in recent years due to the emergence of more modern programming languages, it still holds a significant presence in legacy systems, especially within mainframe environments. 2. Basic (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code): Basic, as the name suggests, is a general-purpose programming language that was designed with simplicity in mind. Created by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz at Dartmouth College in 1964, Basic aimed to provide an accessible and straightforward programming platform for people who did not have prior experience in computer programming. The language emphasizes ease of use with a simple syntax and structure, making it popular among beginners in programming. Basic has been widely used in educational settings, and its dialects have found their way onto various computing platforms, including early personal computers like the Apple II and Commodore 64. Although the popularity of Basic has waned with the advent of newer and more versatile programming languages, it played a crucial role in accelerating the adoption of computers in the home and education sectors. 3. Fortran (FORmula TRANslation): Fortran is a high-level, compiled, imperative programming language that was initially developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and engineering applications. The first version, Fortran I, was created by a team led by John W. Backus in 1957. Its primary purpose was to provide a robust language for performing mathematical calculations and solving complex problems that required processing large amounts of data. Fortran's syntax and design emphasize mathematical functions and operations, which makes it particularly suited for applications in fields such as physics, chemistry, engineering, and computational finance. The language offers excellent performance and allows scientists and engineers to write efficient code that can take advantage of the computing power of supercomputers and high-performance computing clusters. In summary, Cobol, Basic, and Fortran are all types of programming languages that have been fundamental in shaping the field of computer programming. Each has served a specific purpose, with Cobol focusing on business applications, Basic on ease of use and education, and Fortran on scientific and engineering computations. While the prominence of these languages has waned in recent years, their contributions to the development of computing technology cannot be underestimated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Start up a conversation. Visit a spa.","output":"Title: Unlocking the Secrets to Making the Most of Your Time at an Airport Introduction The thought of waiting for hours at an airport may seem daunting for many people; however, there are numerous fun and relaxing activities that can help you make the most of this idle time. Here are seven ways to transform your lengthy layover into a delightful and memorable experience. 1. Head for an Airport Lounge Instead of walking around the terminal aimlessly, seek solace in an airport lounge. Most lounges are designed to provide a comfortable and calming environment, where you can enjoy amenities such as free Wi-Fi, refreshments, magazines, and even shower facilities. Some lounges also offer premium services, including nap pods and charging stations. Don't worry if you're not a premium member of any airlines, as you can usually access these lounges for a fee. 2. Sleep in the Terminal Taking a nap is one of the most effective ways to recharge your batteries during a long layover. Many airports provide designated sleeping areas or sleeping pods, allowing travellers to catch some shut-eye in a safe and comfortable place. Alternatively, you can always find a quiet corner to rest your head on your luggage or use a neck pillow. 3. Grab a Bite to Eat With plenty of dining options at your disposal inside the airport, treat yourself to a meal that satisfies your taste buds. Whether you prefer a fast food joint, a sit-down restaurant, or a local cuisine kiosk, you can find something to satiate your cravings. This culinary experience will not only refuel your body but also offer a respite from the monotony of waiting. 4. Walk Around the Airport Stretch your legs and explore the airport by taking a leisurely stroll through the terminal. This simple yet effective exercise can help to stimulate blood circulation and alleviate any stiffness from prolonged sitting during travel. Plus, airports are often architectural marvels worth discovering, and they may contain interesting art installations or exhibits you do not want to miss. 5. Go to a Chapel or Meditate in a “Quiet Room” Many airports offer chapels or dedicated spaces, known as “quiet rooms,” for travellers seeking a moment of peace and reflection. These areas are ideal for those who wish to meditate, pray, or practice mindfulness during their layover. Engaging in such activities can help to alleviate stress and invite positivity, making your transit more enjoyable. 6. Start Up a Conversation Initiating conversations with fellow travellers can be a fun way to pass the time. With people from all walks of life passing through airports, you may make new friends or hear fascinating stories that would never have come your way otherwise. Do not hesitate to break the ice; who knows, you might even forge lasting connections. 7. Visit a Spa Finally, treat yourself to a pampering session at an airport spa. Whether indulging in a quick massage to alleviate travel-related aches or opting for a comprehensive spa package to rejuvenate your mind and body, the experience is bound to help you unwind and leave you refreshed for the next leg of your journey. Conclusion In conclusion, a layover need not be a dull or taxing experience. By embracing these unexpected opportunities for relaxation, exploration, or socialization, your lengthy layover can become an enjoyable and memorable part of your overall travel experience. The next time you find yourself with time to spare at an airport, consider experimenting with one or more of these activities.

Sentence: \\"Maria asked Sarah if they knew how to setup a smart phone but\\" Here, Maria is asking Sarah for help, implying that Maria doesn't know how to set up a smart phone. Now let's evaluate the options: A) Maria could not figure it out either. This option states that Maria cannot figure out how to set up a smart phone, which we already know from the sentence. It does not provide new information about Sarah's ability to set up a smart phone. B) Sarah could not figure it out either.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date. I remember we went to a nice Italian place on Federal Hill! Here’s the Garden City location, where I worked. Question: What did the waitress have to eat on her date?

Answer the above question based on the context below:  John of Ephesus' account describes the events around the Christianization of Alodia in detail. As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What institution was recommended by William Laver? ?  Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home.  Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895. Although Grainger never returned permanently to Australia, he...

What's Your Influence Score IMAGINE a world in which we are assigned a number that indicates how influential we are. This number would help determine whether you receive a job, a hotel-room upgrade or free samples at the supermarket. If your influence score is low, you don’t get the promotion, the suite or the complimentary cookies. This is not science fiction. It’s happening to millions of social network users. If you have a Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn account, you are already being judged — or will be soon. Companies with names like Klout, PeerIndex and Twitter Grader are in the process of scoring millions, eventually billions, of people on their level of influence — or in the lingo, rating “influencers.” Yet the companies are not simply looking at the number of followers or friends you’ve amassed. Rather, they are beginning to measure influence in more nuanced ways, and posting their judgments — in the form of a score — online. To some, it’s an inspiring tool — one that’s encouraging the democratization of influence. No longer must you be a celebrity, a politician or a media personality to be considered influential. Social scoring can also help build a personal brand. To critics, social scoring is a brave new technoworld, where your rating could help determine how well you are treated by everyone with whom you interact. “Now you are being assigned a number in a very public way, whether you want it or not,” said Mark W. Schaefer, an adjunct professor of marketing at Rutgers University and the executive director of Schaefer Marketing Solutions. “It’s going to be publicly accessible to the people you date, the people you work for. It’s fast becoming mainstream.” Influence scores typically range from 1 to 100. On Klout, the dominant player in this space, the average score is in the high teens. A score in the 40s suggests a strong, but niche, following. A 100, on the other hand, means you’re Justin Bieber. On PeerIndex, the median score is 19. A perfect 100, the company says, is “god-like.” Companies are still refining their methodologies — sifting through data and evaluating other networking sites. This month, Klout announced that it was beginning to incorporate LinkedIn profiles. As Azeem Azhar, chief executive of PeerIndex, put it, “We’re at the start of this journey and we expect the journey to take us into much more nuance and granularity.” Marketers are signing on. More than 2,500 companies are using Klout’s data. Last week, Klout revealed that Audi would begin offering promotions to Facebook users based on their Klout score. Last year, Virgin America used the company to offer highly rated influencers in Toronto free round-trip flights to San Francisco or Los Angeles. In Las Vegas, the Palms Hotel and Casino is using Klout data to give highly rated guests an upgrade or tickets to Cirque du Soleil. “For the first time, we’re all on an even playing field,” said Joe Fernandez, the chief executive and co-founder of Klout. “For the first time, it’s not just how much money you have or what you look like. It’s what you say and how you say it.” How does one become an influencer? After analyzing 22 million tweets last year, researchers at Hewlett-Packard found that it’s not enough to attract Twitter followers — you must inspire those followers to take action. That could mean persuading them to try Bikram yoga, donate to the Sierra Club or share a recipe for apple pie. In other words, influence is about engagement and motivation, not just racking up legions of followers. Industry professionals say it’s also important to focus your digital presence on one or two areas of interest. Don’t be a generalist. Most importantly: be passionate, knowledgeable and trustworthy. Still, scoring is subjective and, for now, imperfect: most analytics companies rely heavily on a user’s Twitter and Facebook profiles, leaving out other online activities, like blogging or posting YouTube videos. As for influence in the offline world — it doesn’t count. Mr. Azhar, of PeerIndex, calls this “the Clay Shirky problem,” referring to the writer and theorist who doesn’t use Twitter much. “He’s obviously massively influential,” Mr. Azhar said, “and right now he has a terrible PeerIndex.” Jeremiah Owyang, an analyst with Altimeter Group, a digital-strategy consulting firm, wrote a few months ago that using a single metric to evaluate influence is dangerous. He noted that Klout “lacks sentiment analysis” — so a user who generates a lot of digital chatter might receive a high score even though what’s being said about the user is negative. Also, a single metric can be misleading: someone with little Twitter experience can snag a high score if they happen to post a video that goes viral. More broadly, Mr. Schaefer of Schaefer Marketing and others are concerned that we are moving closer to creating “social media caste systems,” where people with high scores get preferential treatment by retailers, prospective employers, even prospective dates. No wonder some people are trying to game their scores. Attaining true influence requires time and commitment. And while your flesh-and-blood self deserves a break every now and then, your digital self will pay the price. “I went on vacation for two weeks,” said Mr. Schaefer, “and my Klout score went down.” Stephanie Rosenbloom is a style reporter for The New York Times. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses the rise in influence scores, assigned through companies such as Klout, PeerIndex, and Twitter Grader, which determine an individual's level of influence on social media platforms. These scores are not just based on the number of followers or friends, but also on more nuanced aspects such as engagement and motivation. The scores are being used to determine access to promotions, job offers, and other opportunities. Critics argue that these scores can lead to the creation of \\"social media caste systems,\\" where high scorers receive preferential treatment in various aspects of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: flower fragrance OPT: --make sure to place near a fan. --dip fake flower stem in scented oils.","output":"To determine which of the following solutions is better for the goal of achieving flower fragrance, I will analyze the effectiveness, practicality, and sustainability of each option. Option 1: Make sure to place near a fan Steps:  1. Obtain real or fake flowers. 2. Place the flowers near a fan. 3. Activate the fan. 4. Enjoy the circulating flower scent around the room. Justification for each step: 1. Real or fake flowers are the source of the fragrance. 2. Placing flowers near the fan enables better airflow. 3. Airflow can spread the scent across the room. 4. The circulating scent can help to achieve the goal of flower fragrance. Option 2: Dip fake flower stem in scented oils. Steps: 1. Obtain fake flowers and scented oils. 2. Dip the fake flower stem into the scented oil. 3. Place the flower in a desired area. 4. Enjoy the released flower scent. Justification for each step: 1. Fake flowers will hold the scent, while scented oils contain the fragrance. 2. Dipping the stem in oil allows the flower to absorb the fragrance. 3. Placing the flower ensures that fragrance is distributed in the desired location. 4. The scent will be released slowly, keeping the room fragranced with flower scent. Analysis: Option 1 relies on air circulation for the spread of the fragrance, which could result in a less consistent and weaker scent. It also requires a fan, which might not be energy efficient or suitable in all environments (e.g., outdoors or in a quiet room). Option 2 is a more controlled and sustainable approach, as it provides consistent fragrance in the desired area. It is also applicable in various environments and doesn't require additional devices like a fan. Conclusion: Option 2 (dip fake flower stem in scented oils) is the better solution for the goal of achieving flower fragrance, given its effectiveness, practicality, and sustainability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full anglicized name of the person whose later biographer tentatively accepted the epithet of Scotsman coined by John Evelyn? ?  John Michael Wright, who at the height of his career would interchangeably sign himself \\"Anglus\\" or \\"Scotus\\", is of uncertain origin. The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman, an epithet repeated by Horace Walpole and tentatively accepted by his later biographer, Verne. However, writing in 1700, the English antiquarian Thomas Hearne claims Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London and, after an adolescent conversion to Roman Catholicism, was taken to Scotland by a priest.  A London birth certainly seems supported by a baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a \\"Mighell Wryghtt\\", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London.What is known is that, on 6 April 1636, the 19-year-old Wright was apprenticed to George Jamesone, an Edinburgh portrait painter of some repute. The Edinburgh Register of Apprentices records him as \\"Michaell, son to James W(right), tailor, citizen of London\\". The reasons for this move to Scotland are unclear, but may have to do with familial connections (his parents may have been London Scots) or the advent of plague in London. During his apprenticeship, Wright is likely to have lodged at the High Street tenement near the Netherbow Gate that served as Jameson's workplace. The apprenticeship was contracted for five years, but may have been curtailed by Jameson's imprisonment in late 1639. There is no record of any independent work by Wright from this period (his earliest known painting being a small portrait of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury, painted in the early 1640s during his time in Rome).It is also possible that Wright met his wife during his Scottish residency. Nothing is known of her, except from a statement of thirty years later which describes her as \\"related to the most noble and distinguished families of Scotland.\\" If this is accurate, it may explain how Wright was later able to find aristocratic patronage. All that is known for certain is that Wright had at least one child by her, a son, Thomas.

The line-up changed slightly over the course of the previous year: Steve Dullaghan was replaced on the bass guitar by Paul Sampson, who also shared the production duties with Wayne Morris. Hypothesis: the band has a bass guitar.","output":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that the band has a bass guitar from the given context. The context provided introduces Pure, a 1989 studio album by the British band, The Primitives. It is mentioned that Pure was released as a follow-up to their debut album, \\"Lovely.\\" In addition, the context informs us about the line-up change that occurred over the previous year. We can find information about the bass guitar specifically in the line that reads, \\"Steve Dullaghan was replaced on the bass guitar by Paul Sampson.\\" From this information, we can derive the hypothesis that The Primitives had a bass guitar in their band line-up. The text explicitly states that Dullaghan was replaced by Sampson on the bass guitar. The presence of a bass guitar in their line-up and the change of bass guitarists imply the importance of this instrument in their music production. Furthermore, as Sampson is also mentioned to have shared production duties with Wayne Morris, it can be inferred that the bass guitar played a significant role in shaping the band's sound during the time of the album's release. To summarize, the context provided about The Primitives' album, Pure, gives us enough information to generate the hypothesis that the band has a bass guitar. The change in line-up, specifically the replacement of one bass guitarist with another and the involvement in production duties, emphasizes the crucial role of the bass guitar within the band's musical arrangements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who wanted to start the tour right away?  In a letter to his friend and landlord Johann Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), a prominent Salzburg merchant, written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: \\"Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first\\". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.Wolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently... Answer:","output":"The last name of the person who wanted to start the tour right away is Mozart. Leopold Mozart, the father of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, was eager to begin the tour as soon as possible to showcase the miraculous talents of his young children, Wolfgang and Nannerl. He planned an extensive tour across Europe to present their prodigious abilities to royal courts and various cultural cities, in hopes of garnering recognition and acclaim for their exceptional musical gifts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pretty good film from Preminger; labyrinthine at times, as it explores sets and locales from various angles and perspectives as if it were a nature film on the denizens of the modern city and how they live. In this sense it is visually and spatially satisfying, as its hero, a good cop with a bad temper, gets into very hot water when he accidentally kills a guy with a plate in his head. Dana Andrews plays the lead as if it were Hamlet, and has never been better. The story may be pure melodrama but Andrews gives it weight, and almost raises it to the level of tragedy. As his girl, Gene Tierney is attractive but unremarkable. Gary Merrill makes for a very interesting villain, with his natural warmth providing a nice contrast to Andrews' coolness; his smiling, amiable-seeming bad guy seems to be continually challenging his nemesis by the mere fact of his being emotionally open, as opposed to the tightly wound and moralistic cop who is pursuing him.  There are no major surprises in this film, which seems transitional for all concerned. For director Preminger it is a reunion of sorts with his Laura stars, Andrews and Tierney, who were passing their career peaks at around the time the movie was made. The supporting cast,--Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand--are, understandably, more optimistic, as they were all on their way up. Preminger, as serene an observer as ever, lets the events unfold without expressing a strong point of view, as the morally ambiguous ending is somewhat disappointing, for the cat and mouse game between the two antagonists seems larger and more archetypal than any mere movie could contain, much less resolve.

And wave energy comes from the wind. Let's think about how this works. As wave energy passes through the water, the energy makes particles   of water move up and down. Just give you an example of a wave passing under a basketball. We put a basketball on the sea. When the wind blows, a wave comes from behind the basketball. The basketball moves up to the top with the wave. Then the wave continues and leaves the basketball behind. The basketball looks lower, but it doesn't move forward. That's because the wave energy just moves the water which is under the basketball. So why can you see a wave knock you down on the shore?When a wave moves toward the shore, the bottom of the wave slows down because _ meets the ocean floor. But the top, which is called crest , keeps moving. The different action causes the wave to fall over or break onto the shore. If a wave is very large, it carries a lot of energy when it hits the land. As time goes by, waves can break up and carry away the rocks and other things on the shore. Shorelines are changing all the time because of wave action. Question: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage? Answer: The answer is:","output":"The water actually moves forward with the waves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: All the kooky kids enjoyed each other's company, to them their behavior was perfectly what? Possible A: ordinary, straight, normal, cool, mainstream  Why is \\"normal\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Normal\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because of the following reasons: Step 1: Understand the context of the question The question is about the \\"kooky kids,\\" indicating that they have some unconventional or eccentric behaviors that set them apart from others. They enjoyed each other's company, meaning they likely share similar interests or perspectives. Step 2: Evaluate the possible answers Let's look at each possible answer in relation to the context of the question: - Ordinary: Although ordinary could also mean usual or conforming to a norm, it may not fully capture the essence of the kids' unique behavior that sets them apart from others. - Straight: Straight usually refers to a more conservative, serious, or conventional demeanor, which contradicts the description of \\"kooky.\\" - Normal: In this context, normal means typical or expected behavior from the perspective of the kids themselves. It implies that their eccentricities are not seen as unusual or strange to them and among their peers. - Cool: Cool is more of a subjective term and often conveys a sense of approval or admiration. However, it doesn't directly address the question of whether their behavior is perceived as normal or not. - Mainstream: Mainstream refers to something that is widely accepted or practiced by the majority. In this case, it does not accurately capture the unique or unconventional nature of the kids' behavior. Step 3: Choose the answer aligned with human common sense Based on the evaluation of the possible answers, \\"normal\\" is the most appropriate answer aligned with human common sense. It reflects the idea that, to the kooky kids, their unique and eccentric behavior is perceived as typical or expected within their own social group, even if it may deviate from broader societal norms."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Question: how does weather happen I found the following answer on Google: Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the given answer is incorrect as it explains weather forecasting, not how weather occurs. Weather happens due to the complex interaction of the Earth's atmosphere, land surfaces, and oceans. The primary driving forces behind the weather are the energy from the Sun and Coriolis effect from Earth's rotation. This causes various weather phenomena such as wind, clouds, rain, and snow to occur.  One crucial element of weather is temperature differences, which are caused by the uneven distribution of solar energy on the Earth's surface. This is influenced by the tilt of the Earth's axis and its rotation as well as the absorption and reflection of solar energy by the atmosphere, land, and ocean. Temperature differences cause warm air to rise and cool air to sink, creating convective currents that transport heat around the planet. The water cycle also plays a significant role in weather formation. The Sun's energy causes water to evaporate from land and bodies of water, which then cools and condenses, forming clouds. Depending on the temperature and atmospheric pressure, these clouds can produce precipitation in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail. In addition, the Earth's rotation creates the Coriolis effect, which causes air traveling within the atmosphere to be deflected. This results in the formation of global wind patterns such as the trade winds, polar easterlies, and the jet stream. These components of the Earth's system work together to produce an immense variety of weather conditions experienced around the globe. Various meteorological events, such as cold and warm fronts, low-pressure systems, and high-pressure systems, arise due to the complex interactions between these factors."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They were also carrying some bags of sand. After the sun rose, the balloon went higher. It went up to 3,000 metres, and the air was very cold. The water in the balloon became ice. Snow fell past the men's basket, and they could see more snow on the ground. The men tried to throw out some more sand; but it was hard. They tried to break the icy sand with their knives, but it was not easy. The work was slow and they were still falling, so they had to drop some whole bags of sand. One of them fell on an icy lake and made a black hole in the ice. At last they pulled the box into the basket. It was still snowing; so they climbed to get away from the snow.

Kerry Cabbin, the founder of Tough Cookies Education, which delivers workshops on sex and relationships to teenagers, says the digital age has created a culture where sexual bullying is considered a guide to whether boys like them and more targeted education is needed in the classrooms. Sexual harassment has become a major issue in schools in the UK. This report by the Commons Women and Equalities Committee does not surprise me as it highlights many of the problems that young people face on a daily basis. All too often sexual harassment and bullying is dismissed as banter. The behaviour is considered to be flirtatious or a laugh by pupils. Far too often, young people do not realise that their actions constitute sexual harassment. There's something about secondary school aged children - they are not being educated that this type of behaviour is not right. The MPs' report revealed 29% of 16-18 year old girls had said they have experienced unwanted sexual touching at school. In 2015, a BBC Freedom of Information request found more than 5,500 alleged sex crimes in UK schools were reported to police in the past three years. In 2010, a YouGov poll found 71% of girls had heard the terms \\"slut\\" or \\"slag\\" used towards them at school. Through the workshops we deliver we have found that many young women see sexual harassment as an indication of whether a person likes them or not. It is used as a guide to figure out if a boy fancies them. In the 1970s a boy would ask them out to the cinema, now girls think a boy likes them if they slap their bottom. Young women are no longer feeling empowered. When we spoke to the teenage girls in our workshops, not one of them had been educated before on giving sexual consent. Often, if someone wants to touch them sexually or kiss them they don't feel confident enough to say no. There are not enough girls that feel strong enough to stand up and say this is not acceptable. The digital era has also played a part in this culture. Young people use their mobile phones to communicate so when it comes to verbal interaction it all gets a bit muddled. We have found that young people have become desensitised to sexual language. In this day and age there is no watershed. Young people are exposed to sexual words and they are willing to use them in everyday settings. Girls have become less offended so can hear words such as \\"slag\\" or \\"slut\\" and they don't think it is an issue. Often girls will even use these words themselves. The Commons Women and Equalities Committee made recommendations to the government which included: Young people need to realise that sexual harassment shouldn't be accepted but I wouldn't like to see all of this behaviour criminalised. Pupils are often learning this behaviour from TV. In my day we watched Byker Grove but now children are watching Geordie Shore and Ex on the Beach. They show this type of sexual harassment so teenagers begin to think that it is acceptable. They think \\"oh well, if they're showing it on TV then it must be OK\\". I believe the majority of this inappropriate behaviour is not intended to damage or hurt the person it is targeted towards. It's seen as banter and a bit of fun. Sexual harassment in schools needs to be treated as seriously as bullying. Many schools have moved forward and brought in specialist anti-bullying policies and sexual harassment needs to come under this umbrella. Young people need to be educated and given the confidence to say that this behaviour is not acceptable. I believe that young people would listen to this education and would adapt and change the culture. What was that article about?","output":"The article discusses the growing issue of sexual harassment in UK schools, a concern highlighted by Kerry Cabbin, founder of Tough Cookies Education. Cabbin mentions how the digital age has indirectly promoted a culture where acts of sexual harassment are often misconstrued as banter or signs of mutual attraction, particularly among teenagers. She reflects on her experiences conducting workshops on sex and relationship education, where she noticed a trend of young women interpreting harassment as an indication of a boy’s interest in them. According to a report by the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, 29% of girls aged 16-18 years confirmed experiencing unwanted sexual touching at school, and the term \\"slut\\" or \\"slag\\" was heard by 71% of girls in school according to a 2010 YouGov poll. A BBC Freedom of Information request in 2015 discovered over 5,500 alleged sex crimes in UK schools reported to the police over the previous three years. Cabbin asserts that an important part of the problem is the lack of education about such issues. Many girls aren't educated about the concept of sexual consent and therefore don't feel confident enough to decline unwanted advances. The rise of the digital era has contributed to ineffective verbal interaction and desensitization towards explicit language. Cabbin advocates that a well-informed dialogue and education about acceptable behaviour is a more appropriate solution rather than legal punishments. The article underlines that a majority of young people erroneously consider such inappropriate behaviour light-hearted and harmless, influenced to a large extent by television shows that normalize such conduct. Cabbin stressed that just like anti-bullying initiatives, sexual harassment needs to be taken seriously in schools, with effective policy implementation and emphasis on a more informed education system that can give young people the confidence to distinguish right from wrong and courageously oppose unacceptable behaviour. This would help to alter the prevailing culture surrounding sexual harassment among young people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He struggles with past traumas and is slowly piecing his life back together after a tragic boating accident in which he lost his wife and daughter. Jack's boss, Dr. Amelia Hughes, notices his distress and encourages him to take a break to clear his mind. Jack reluctantly agrees and sets off on a solo diving expedition on the beautiful, isolated shoreline of a nearby atoll. As Jack dives into the calm crystal waters, he's captivated by the marine life below. He descends deeper, seeking solace in the aquatic realm far from his terrestrial pain. During his exploration, Jack discovers a submerged car hidden within a cluster of coral and covered in years' worth of algae. Curious about this unusual find, Jack swims closer and is momentarily stunned as he finds two people still inside the car. The two occupants, a man and a woman in their mid-30s, appear to have been trapped for an unexpectedly long time without showing any signs of decay. Puzzled by this discovery, Jack surfaces and reports his findings to Dr. Hughes, who believes the situation merits further investigation. As the town's mystery deepens, the submerged car becomes the center of a web of long-buried secrets and scandals. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn that the couple, Charlotte and Thomas Kingsley, were well-known in the town and had gone missing ten years earlier. The open case had gone cold, and their families had all but given up hope of ever finding them. As Jack and Amelia delve deeper, it becomes apparent that not everything is as it seems; powerful forces within the town had been keen on keeping the lower-profile disappearance a secret. Jack and Amelia embark on a journey to unravel the truth surrounding the couple's disappearance and the eerie preservation of their bodies. They unearth a dangerous, illicit, and morally corrupt marine biotechnology experiment conducted by a group of elite local businessmen, seeking to create a formula for eternal youth. Charlotte and Thomas had discovered the scheme and were silenced before they could expose it. As Jack grows more involved in the case, he's faced with confronting the grief and guilt of his past and learning how these experiences have shaped him. He must find the courage to navigate these complex emotions, all the while determined to bring justice to the wronged couple and reveal the town's dark secrets at any cost. In a thrilling climax, Jack and Amelia confront the mastermind behind the experiment, holding the deceitful businessman accountable for the tragic consequences of his actions. The revelation sends shockwaves through the town, and the entire town participates in dismantling the corrupted enclave that hid the horrors in plain sight. In the end, Depths of Desolation is a poignant tale of redemption, forgiveness, and rebirth. The film explores the power of human connection and resilience in healing from tragedy, even as it confronts the dark side of humanity and the lengths people are willing to go in pursuit of their desires."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What do most salamanders use to find a mate?\\" is olfaction.  Salamanders are a diverse group of amphibians, which means they rely on certain cues to find and identify potential mates. One of the primary ways in which salamanders locate and attract mates is through their highly developed sense of smell, known as olfaction. This sense is critical for many aspects of their life, such as finding food, avoiding predators, and seeking out mates. Salamander mating systems are complex, and they often involve chemical communication through the exchange of pheromones. Pheromones are chemical substances secreted by one individual that can have a profound influence on the behavior of other individuals of the same species. In the context of salamander mating, these chemicals help to provide essential information about a potential mate, such as their health, genetic compatibility, and overall reproductive fitness. During the mating process, male salamanders often deposit a spermatophore (a capsule containing sperm) on a suitable substrate, which is later picked up by a receptive female. Olfaction plays a crucial role in this process, as the female needs to be able to detect, locate, and recognize the spermatophore of a male in order to ensure successful fertilization of her eggs. In some instances, male salamanders may even emit specific pheromones that make the spermatophore more appealing to a potential mate. It is worth noting that while olfaction is the primary way most salamanders find a mate, different species may use additional strategies and cues. For example, some salamanders may use visual displays or tactile interactions to supplement their chemical communication. Despite these variations, olfaction remains the most essential sense for the majority of salamanders when it comes to finding and securing a suitable mate. Given the importance of their sense of smell in the process of mate-finding, it is clear that olfaction is the best answer to the question \\"What do most salamanders use to find a mate?\\" among the given answer choices. The other options, such as sound, seduction, fur and fat, heat energy, air, environment, and water, are either unrelated, overly broad, or not specific to the mate-finding process for salamanders."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Nearly a year after Sept. 11, the Legal Aid Society-the lawyers for New York's poor and homeless-remains, well, homeless. The nonprofit has been barred from returning to its 90 Church St. headquarters, across from the World Trade Center site, because of environmental concerns. Legal Aid has uncomfortable company. More than 11,500 New Yorkers continue to work out of temporary space, according to analysis by Manhattan-based real estate brokerage TenantWise.com Inc. and Crain's New York Business. That's 8% of the 137,000 workers who lost their offices or access to them when the Twin Towers collapsed.

Positive scan result and celbrating Coppafeel!'s seventh birthday It was good news for me last week and it's CoppaFeel!'s seventh birthday this week. So a chance to work out how far we've come IT’S not often I share what is actually going on with my health. But last week I got my results from brain and body scans and am happy to say the news was good. My cancer is stable for now and the new drug I am on appears to be working. In all honesty I have been avoiding thinking about my health, let alone sharing any updates, for fear there is something bad going on. Instead I delved deeply into work and any other distraction I could find. I don’t want to be a fair-weather health advocate. I do want to share my cancer story, warts and all, but confronting it and putting into words how I felt leading up to the results was impossible for me. I was completely crippled by negative thoughts. It’s been a difficult few months adjusting to new treatments, a new oncologist and a new outlook on my healing. There have been moments when I felt completely overwhelmed, completely out of hope and entirely shattered by it all. Those moments make the good ones all the better, so on hearing that my cancer was stable I let out a pretty big sigh of relief – although it’s early days and we shouldn’t really be getting too excited. It’s celebrations all round as this week we also toast CoppaFeel!’s seventh birthday. It’s seven years since we got our official six-digit charity number. On the same day I also had my breast removed. So although I lost a boob, I gained a purpose: To spread boob love far and wide (which I would have done with or without getting charity status, it just helps to do it with). It makes me chuckle at how little I knew about running a charity back then. I think fondly about my naivety, stubbornness and determination and I am glad I knew so little. Had I known then what I do now, I think I’d have been put off.

Article: A portable lung which could help those with breathing problems lead a normal life is being developed by scientists. The Swansea University scientists say it could take many years before the device  , the size of a spectacle box   , is available . Lung patients , who have seen how it would work , have welcomed the research. Its research suggests that one person in every seven in the UK is affected by lung disease---- this equates to approximately 8 million people. As of 6 March 2009, 217 people were on the waiting list for a lung transplant  according to figures by NHS Blood and Transplant . Now scientists in Swansea are developing a portable artificial lung which could transform   the lives of patients . Researchers claim that in the long term the device could offer an alternative to lung transplant , giving hope to those who suffer from conditions such as emphysema  and cystic fibrosis. The device mimics the function of a lung---by getting oxygen into and carbon dioxide out of the blood stream . Professor Bill Johns came up with the idea after his son died of Cystic Fibrosis . It is important that we make something that will help people , who instead of being confined   to a wheelchair with an oxygen bottle , can actually walk around and do things for themselves , he said. Although the research has been welcomed by leading charities  , caution has also been voiced over the length of time it will take before a portable lung will become available . \\"We have to stress that this is several years away from being used , even in a trial stage,\\" said Chris Mulholland , head of the British Lung Foundation. Patient Elizabeth Spence from Swansea has been refused the double lung transplant she needs but remains hopeful that one day the new device could save her . \\" My body will reject the lungs , so this possibly could be an answer--- another way of getting new lungs without actually having the transplant,\\" she said.

Trabucco accidentally is injected with a tranquilizer intended for Victor, who volunteers to fulfill the killer's contract when Trabucco's vision is impaired. After overcoming assorted complications, Victor completes his task. However, despite Victor's high hopes, Trabucco has no intention of sticking together and parts ways with him following their escape.

If she borrowed a total of 325,000, 80% of which was in the first mortgage, what is her approximate monthly interest payment?  Option A: 1,354  Option B: 1,733  Option C: 3,466  Option D: 13,333  Option E: 20,796 Output:","output":"To solve this task, you need to follow these simple steps: 1. Identify the main information given in the question: total amount borrowed (325,000), the ratio between the first and second mortgage (80%), and the annual interest rates (4% and 9%). 2. Calculate the amount of the first and second mortgage using the ratio:     First mortgage:  80% of 325,000 = 0.8 * 325,000 = 260,000    Second mortgage: the remaining 20% = 325,000 - 260,000 = 65,000 3. Calculate the annual interest for each mortgage by using their interest rates:    First mortgage interest: 4% of 260,000 = 0.04 * 260,000 = 10,400    Second mortgage interest: 9% of 65,000 = 0.09 * 65,000 = 5,850 4. Combine both annual interests to find the total annual interest:    Total annual interest = 10,400 (first mortgage) + 5,850 (second mortgage) = 16,250 5. Convert the annual interest to monthly interest by dividing by 12:    Monthly interest = 16,250 / 12 = 1,354.17 (approximately) 6. Match this value to the closest option given:    Option A: 1,354 is the closest to our approximate monthly interest payment. So, the answer to the problem is Option A: 1,354."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Given the following context:  After his tour, Dylan returned to New York, but the pressures increased. ABC Television had paid an advance for a TV show. His publisher, Macmillan, was demanding a manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula. Manager Albert Grossman had scheduled a concert tour for the latter part of the year. On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 motorcycle near his home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized. Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him. Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: \\"I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was that I wanted to get out of the rat race.\\" Dylan withdrew from public and, apart from a few appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.Once Dylan was well enough to resume creative work, he began to edit D. A. Pennebaker's film of his 1966 tour. A rough cut was shown to ABC Television, which rejected it as incomprehensible to a mainstream audience. The film was subsequently titled Eat the Document on bootleg copies, and it has been screened at a handful of film festivals.

Article: When one of the most powerful men in the country is so thin-skinned he publicly melts down at every perceived slight, it’s a powerful visual to watch a consummate, composed professional woman take a cool look at her own blood and continue singing without missing a beat.      By Theo Wargo/Getty Images      On Saturday night at the Tidal X 1015 concert at Brooklyn’s Barclay’s Center, Beyoncé accidentally ripped out an elaborate earring from one ear while performing. You can see from the red carpet photo how it might have easily snagged. Beyoncé seemed to notice the slow trickle of blood coming off her lobe during a performance of “Haunted” and, after calmly clocking the carnage, she warmly asked the crowd how they were doing.      Beyoncé fans watching the livestream of the concert, however, reacted with a little less chill. Soon the hashtag #CutForBeyonce started trending, with fans offering to slice themselves open all for the love of Bey. The tweets come with a lot of disturbing imagery (most surely fake, but still), so click with caution. You knew, theoretically, that Beyoncé fans would do anything for their queen. But perhaps you didn’t know it could go this far.      The following video shows the exact moment when the earring ripped—thanks, it seems, to Beyoncé’s long braid.      She pauses, walks to the side, and is back to her elaborate head-whipping choreography within seconds. But it’s that image of the singer dispassionately recognizing her own blood and soldiering on anyway that will stick with the entire BeyHive.

Miller killed at least 10 insurgents and wounded dozens more in repeatedly exposing himself to enemy fire \\"in keeping with the highest traditions of military service,\\" the citation said.

It makes sense since he was the one conducting the ceremony and awarding the Medal of Honor. The other options are wrong because they involve people or objects that can't talk or ask people to stand, such as Afghanistan, CNN, Florida, Green Beret, Medal of Honor, Washington, D.C., and White House.

She comments that the arrow missed the heart and then she finishes off the reindeer with one shot.Ever since she was born, Hanna has been trained by Erik to become an assassin. As part of her training, she has never come into contact with modern technology and has memorized a series of fake back stories for herself to be used when the time comes.One night, Hanna approaches Erik and tells him that she is \\"ready\\", and he retrieves a box containing an old transmitter, which he gives to her. After analyzing the situation, Hanna flips the switch, sending a signal of her location to Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett), a corrupt CIA agent. Marissa sends a team to Erik's cabin, where Hanna, who had been waiting for them, is captured and taken to a CIA safe house in Morocco. There, she discovers that Erik is a former CIA agent who betrayed the agency and knows a secret that can't become public.

Hanna and Erik are ultimately reunited at the amusement park, but their reunion is short-lived as Marissa and her associates arrive at the scene shortly after. Marissa chases Hanna through the twisted and eerie amusement park, with the thrilling pursuit taking the characters through various attractions, including dilapidated funhouses, overgrown roller coaster tracks, and abandoned carousels. The climax of the chase between Marissa and Hanna occurs in the central area of the amusement park, where an intense standoff between the two takes place. Hanna, utilizing her extensive training and expert combat skills, manages to gain the upper hand in the confrontation.

Hanna's quest for vengeance, survival, and the truth about her origins and Erik's past culminates in this prolonged chase sequence through the haunting grounds of the abandoned amusement park in Berlin. Throughout the film, the cat-and-mouse game between Marissa and Hanna showcases both the physical and psychological aspects of the intense chase, with Hanna becoming more resourceful and determined to protect herself and those she cares about, while Marissa constantly tries to maintain control and manipulate those around her to achieve her objectives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Someone enduring emotional hardship may struggle to be decisive, or may simply not know how to behave or what to do.  This is an indication of vulnerability, and is an entirely natural reaction to distress.  They may not even want to talk about whatever happened, and you shouldn’t push them to do so unless someone else’s safety or well-being depends on it. If someone insists they need space, give it to them.  Tell them you’ll check back with them in a few days.  Let them know they can contact you whenever they wish to do so and that you’re there for them whenever they want to spend time together. Don’t be incessant, but make sure you behave in a way that lets them know you’re still thinking about them, and that their wellbeing matters to you.  Call or send a card if a week goes by without hearing from them.  Avoid texting, emailing, or using social media to convey condolences, as these communication tools are informal and impersonal. Don’t avoid or ignore someone because you’re uncomfortable with what they’re going through or don’t know how to talk to them.  If you’re uncertain about what to do or say, convey your condolences and ask if there is anything you can do. If they seem to want you around but aren’t saying much, don’t let their silence bother you.  Don’t allow your own nervousness to lead you to talk nonstop.  Remind yourself that they may simply want your company.  Feel free to ask questions about how they’re feeling, or what they’re thinking about.  If they are persistently thinking about whatever happened, they likely need to talk about to it release any pent-up emotions. Avoid asking someone how they feel if you run into them at a social function.  While you should encourage them to talk about how they’re feeling, do so in an environment where you have privacy and can give them your full attention. Following a traumatic incident, some people will be physically exhausted or depressed.  They may sleep more than usual, and may let struggle to complete everyday chores. Help out by doing a load of laundry or cleaning the dishes.  Take care not to do everything though, as this may impede their recovery or make them feel pitied. People need to feel capable of taking care of themselves, even when they need a bit of help doing so. When the person seems ready, ask them what they plan to do.  Don’t be surprised if they do not know or are not excited to talk about it. Provide some potential routes that they might take while offering to help them do so. Even when making recommendations, try to do more listening than talking, and only offer actionable advice.  Any suggestions you make should be based on things they’ve said themselves. Asking them who and what they think might help is a good place to start. Stay alert for any signs of worsening emotional distress.

Is the following review positive or negative? I ate here out of default. I should've known better than to settle for a random restaurant, but I was starving and so was my boyfriend and his mom. My bf's mother had just checked in to her room and taking the time to research a good restaurant or walk around to find something familiar would've taken too long. I ordered the Salt & Pepper Pork because I loved eating Salt & Pepper chicken back home & figured this would taste similar. My bf ordered the Honey Walnut Shrimp & Scallop Fried Rice (which didn't really have scallops. Scallop flakes were just mixed in with the rice). His mother ordered a seafood soup. The food came out and the soup was the first thing that I had. It tasted okay. The seafood in it was bland. Then I went for the Salt & Pepper Pork. The first bite that I took, I spit out. It tasted like fat! So I bit into the other end and it was still fat! So i tried another piece just to see if I just happened to get a fat piece the first time, but nope! The second piece that I tried was fatty too! Hated it!!! I went for the rice next and it wasn't so bad. Not as flavorful but it was definitely better than the fat that I had just eaten. Sad that the meal wasn't going as well as I had hoped, I was willing to give the Honey Walnut Shrimp a chance. Wrong decision. It was nasty!! The glaze didn't taste anything like the typical Honey Walnut Shrimp glaze that I was used to. Tasted like fatty mayo was glazed all over it. I wanted to raise my voice as I complained about the food, but I also didn't want to start trouble. I think I was also just shocked at how many large groups were dining there. I wondered if they actually liked their food cuz non of them had that disgusted/dissatisfied look on their faces. It could be that they weren't as affected by the food because they were enjoying each other's company, or it could also be that they weren't starving before they ate, so they weren't as let down as I was.

Please answer the following question: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first.  Which team had a higher likelihood of their can exploding? Answer:","output":"Team A had a higher likelihood of their can exploding due to not venting their can of soup before placing it over the campfire. As explained by the kinetic-molecular theory, heating the can without venting it causes a significant increase in pressure inside the can, which may eventually lead to an explosion. When the can is heated, the air molecules inside gain more kinetic energy from the heat coming from the campfire. This increased kinetic energy causes air molecules to move faster, impacting the container's walls with more force and more frequently. As a result, the pressure inside the can rises. In addition to the increase in pressure from the heated air, the soup itself may start boiling due to the heat. The boiling soup aids in the production of even more gas, which further increases the pressure inside the can. In an unvented can, this additional pressure has nowhere to escape, further increasing the risk of explosion. On the other hand, Team B vented their can of soup prior to heating it up, which allowed for pressure to be released during the heating process. As pressure from the heated air and boiling soup was allowed to escape through the vent, there was a significantly lower risk of explosion. In conclusion, Team A, who heated their can of soup without venting it first, had a higher likelihood of experiencing an explosion due to the buildup of pressure within the can as a result of the heating and boiling process. The kinetic-molecular theory helps explain this phenomenon and demonstrates the importance of venting a can of soup before heating it over a campfire to avoid dangerous situations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  The two sides to Poulenc's musical nature caused misunderstanding during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, \\"He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual\\"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, \\"Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today.\\" Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, \\"There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [du Printemps]. It was not progress.\\" Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: \\"You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music\\".In his last years Poulenc observed, \\"if people are still interested in my music in 50 years' time it will be for my Stabat Mater rather than the Mouvements perpétuels.\\" In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: \\"both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias.\\" At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as \\"a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds.

Article: KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) - Nepal has given its security personnel permission to shoot pro-Tibet demonstrators during China's Olympic flame climb to Mount Everest's summit early next month. \\"About 25 soldiers and policemen have established camps on the mountain and they have been ordered to use force if necessary to stop any anti-Chinese activities,\\" Mod Raj Dotel, spokesman for the home ministry, said Sunday. \\"This could mean shooting if necessary.\\" Security personnel will also check mountain climbers for non-essential expedition materials, Dotel added.  \\"If anyone is found with anti-Chinese material their permit will be canceled and returned from the mountain,\\" he said.  Chinese climbers plan to take the Olympic flame to the top of the world's highest peak, at 8,848 meters (29,028 feet) as part of the global relay leading up to the August 8 opening of the Summer Olympics in Beijing. Spring is the most popular season for climbing Mount Everest, which straddles  the border between Nepal and Tibet, an autonomous region of China.  The Nepali government has given permits to dozens of climbers from 30 expeditions this season.  But between May 1 and May 10, climbers are  _ from going above 6,400 meters until the torch run is completed. China plans to take the Olympic flame to the summit sometime then. Bad weather conditions allow only about two opportunities in May for a push to the summit. The Chinese have not allowed any expedition to climb the mountain from the north side, according the Kathmandu representative of the Tibet China Mountaineering Association. Almost every day in the past month, Nepalese police have arrested pro-Tibet protesters from in front of the Chinese Embassy and the United Nations offices. The demonstrators are released later in the evening.   Supporters of Tibet punish the government's attitude toward the autonomous region, and many believe China should not have been awarded the honor of hosting the Olympic Games.

Hypothesis: The press is exaggerating the disappointing gross to make up for overhyping the film. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Entailment in a logical argument refers to a relationship between statements where the truth of one statement requires the truth of another. It indicates that if the premises are true, then the hypothesis also must be true.  In the case at hand, the premise is hinting at some disappointment concerning the gross earnings of a film, which the press had previously overhyped. It suggests that 8 million cannot be seen as disappointing yet the press is painting it as such. It seems to be criticizing the press for overexposing or overselling the film, leading to inflated expectations, and then exaggerating the disappointing results when it did not meet those expectations. The hypothesis then simplifies this sentiment saying, \\"The press is exaggerating the disappointing gross to make up for overhyping the film.\\" It suggests that the press, realizing its prior overhyping was misplaced, is now trying to balance that by blowing the 'disappointing' earnings out of proportion. Despite some slight differences in expression, both the premise and the hypothesis communicate the same fundamental assertion: that the press overhyped the movie and is now exaggerating its disappointment over the movie's gross revenue. This indicates that there is an entailment relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, as the latter essentially reframes the former in simpler terms.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person Weiss wants to prosecute?, using the article: Sherman McCoy is a Wall Street bond trader who makes millions while enjoying the good life and the sexual favors of Maria Ruskin, a Southern belle gold digger. Sherman and Maria are driving back to Maria's apartment from JFK Airport when they take a wrong turn on the expressway and find themselves in the \\"war-zone\\" of the South Bronx. They are approached by two black youths after Sherman gets out of the car to move a tire out of the road. Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers. The two drive away. Sherman initially wants to report the incident to the police, but Maria immediately talks him out of it, fearing that their affair would be publicly exposed. Meanwhile, alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow, anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish district attorney Abe Weiss, who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election. According to Judge Leonard White, almost all of DA Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minority-majority community that he is worth re-electing. Weiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the owner of the car, and therefore presumed to be the hit-and-run driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

The neocortex plays an important role in many complex brain functions. In some mammals, such as rats, the neocortex is relatively smooth. In other mammals, especially humans, the neocortex has many folds. The folds increase the surface area of the neocortex. The larger this area is, the greater the mental abilities of an animal.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- The United States knows that the leader of Pakistan's Taliban is dead because he has not appeared in public to prove that he is alive, the top U.S. envoy to the region told CNN on Monday.  Baitullah Mehsud, right, and a bodyguard arrive at a meeting in South Waziristan, Pakistan, in 2004.  Richard Holbrooke said that the Pakistani Taliban have not confirmed the death of Baitullah Mehsud because of an ongoing power struggle over his successor.  \\"The reason it's clear he's dead is that if he weren't dead, he'd be giving TV and radio interviews to prove he's not dead,\\" Holbrooke told CNN's Cal Perry.  Mehsud rarely gave news conferences or appeared before the media. There has been conflicting information from the Pakistani Taliban about whether Mehsud died in a suspected U.S. missile strike earlier this month. Watch Holbrooke say Mehsud is dead »  Last week, Pakistani Taliban spokesman Maulvi Umar told CNN that Mehsud is alive, but ill, and will speak to reporters when he feels better.  Other media reports have quoted another spokesman for the group as saying Mehsud is dead and a mourning period is underway.  U.S. and Pakistani government officials have said they are confident that Mehsud was killed in the August 5 strike.  DNA tests were reportedly being conducted to back up those claims, but U.S. officials have expressed doubt that enough genetic material would be left behind, considering the enormity of the strike.  Holbrooke said Mehsud's death has sparked \\"a succession crisis\\" among the Pakistani Taliban.  Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. Who is known to have died? 2.

The premise offers the following information: 1. There is an upstairs area, which has a gift shop. 2. The entrance to the connecting walkway to the cathedral is also located upstairs. 3. One can climb the tower, which offers an interesting view of the surroundings. From these details, we can deduce that there's a possibility of some visitor amenities being located upstairs, such as the gift shop and the entrance to the walkway. Furthermore, the premise suggests that climbing the tower could be an appealing activity due to the interesting view of the surroundings. However, the premise does not provide any direct information regarding the cost or pricing of any of the activities or amenities, including the walkway. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively infer whether the hypothesis \\"Admission to the walkway is quite expensive\\" is true or false, simply based on the information provided in the premise. In order to determine the validity of the hypothesis, additional information or evidence would be needed.

In Washington, D.C. there is a whole set of slang to describe politics and business in the city. For example, the term POTUS stands for President of the United States. POTUS can often be found with his wife, FLOTUS, the first lady of the United States. \\"Inside the Beltway\\" is a popular expression that describes the area of Washington, D.C. The beltway is the large highway that circles the city. The Internet has helped create a whole new kind of computer-related slang. An \\"angry fruit salad\\" is an expression that describes a website with too many bright colors. \\"Netiquette\\" is slang for correct behavior when using the Internet. Young people often develop the latest slang. For example, to say Special English \\"rocks\\" or is \\"phat\\" means Special English is really great. A \\"kegger\\" is a party where beer is served.  If something is \\"wack\\", it is wild and crazy. Different professions often have their own slang as well. For example, medical workers might refer to a complaining patient as a \\"gomer\\".  A \\"tough stick\\" is someone whose veins are difficult to find when he or she needs to have blood taken. No matter how well you speak English, there are always new and interesting slang words to discover. There are entire dictionaries for describing slang. Many experts do not even agree on what is and what is not slang. Often slang words later become a part of officially accepted language. Official or not, slang is an energetic and exciting part of the American language that continues to change. Question: Which of the following is NOT true for slang compared with the official language? Options: A: Playful B: Direct C: Less respectful D: More official Answer:","output":"D: More official"},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

STAYAWAY FROM THE STATIONIf traveling to your destination by train, you may want to find a good base close to the station, but you could end up paying more for the sake of convenience at the start of your holiday. Don't be too choosy about the part of town you stay in. Booking two months in advance, the cheapest room at Travelodge's Central Euston hotel inLondonfor Saturday 22 September was PS95.95. A room just a tube journey away at itsCovent Gardenhotel was PS75.75. And at Farringdon, a double room cost just PS62.95.

Please answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Questions: What is something that you eat that has a heel? Options: - foot - sandal - loaf of bread - shoe - boot A:","output":"The option in line with common sense to answer the question, \\"What is something that you eat that has a heel?\\" would be a \\"loaf of bread\\". In the context of food, the term \\"heel\\" is commonly used to refer to both ends of a loaf of bread. The term is believed to have originated because these ends of the bread take on a rounded, heel-like shape as they bake in the oven.  This comparison fits because of the product in question and the act of eating mentioned in the question. The remaining options - foot, sandal, shoe, and boot - are items that are typically associated with the physical heel of a human or the lower part of a shoe. They are not items that would commonly be associated with consumption.  Therefore, consuming a foot, sandal, shoe, or boot would not typically align with societal norms or indeed dietary norms. Loaf of bread is the only option that fits the context of the question correctly because a loaf of bread is an edible item and the term \\"heel\\" can denote the end parts of a loaf of bread. So, when the question asks for something that can be eaten and that has a heel, \\"loaf of bread\\" is the best option presented.  This understanding additionally comes from our knowledge about the customs around the world and the shared understanding in English-speaking societies that \\"heel\\" is the term used for the end slice of bread. So, even though the options might signify a \\"heel\\" in other contexts, the common sense answer to this question would be \\"loaf of bread\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Its troops had played a key role in weakening the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab group in Somalia, Mr Obama said. He was speaking after talks with Ethiopia's PM Hailemariam Desalegn, during the first ever visit by a US president to the East African state. He also called on Mr Hailemariam to improve Ethiopia's record on human rights and good governance. \\"I don't bite my tongue too much when it comes to these issues,\\" he said at a joint press conference in the capital, Addis Ababa. BBC Africa Live: Obama in Ethiopia updates Some rights groups have criticised Mr Obama's visit, warning that it could lend credibility to a government accused of jailing journalists and critics. A legal case currently being fought through the US courts alleges that agents of the Ethiopian government eavesdropped on the internet activities of a man in the US state of Maryland. The man, born in Ethiopia and now a US citizen, works for a political opposition group outlawed in his home country. Addressing the media, Mr Obama described the Ethiopian government, which won all parliamentary seats in May's election, as \\"democratically elected\\". Opposition group have said the poll was rigged. Mr Hailemariam said Mr Obama's visit had taken a century-long relationship with the US to a \\"new height\\". \\"Our commitment to democracy is real, not skin-deep,\\" he added. Answering a question about press freedom, Mr Hailemariam said Ethiopia wanted \\"civilised journalism\\", and not reporters linked with \\"violent terrorist groups\\". On the security threat by al-Shabab, Mr Obama said there had been a \\"shrinkage\\" of the group since the deployment of regional troops to Somalia, its main base. However, the killing of 15 people in a bomb attack on a hotel in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, on Sunday was a reminder that \\"we have to now keep the pressure on\\", he said. \\"We don't need to send our own marines in to do the fighting: The Ethiopians are tough fighters and the Kenyans and Ugandans have been serious about what they're doing.\\" Mr Obama flew to Ethiopia after a two-day visit to Kenya where he had discussed trade and security but also called for greater human rights and warned of the dangers of corruption. Compared to the Kenyan leg of his tour, President Obama's arrival in Ethiopia has signalled a more sombre mood. After talks in the ornate setting of the presidential palace, Mr Obama sought to highlight the areas of agreement with his host and tread cautiously over the delicate issue of democratic rights. He praised Mr Hailemariam for the country's contribution to peacekeeping efforts in the region, and said the US wanted to help \\"sustain momentum\\" on Ethiopia's impressive rates of economic growth. Addis Ababa has undergone a massive building boom, thanks in part to substantial Chinese investment But on the thorny issue of press freedom, much still divides the pair. Mr Obama said it was a \\"significant topic of discussion\\", and insisted that a vibrant and free press would strengthen rather than inhibit Ethiopia's development. For his part, the prime minister called for \\"civilised journalism\\" and said Ethiopian journalists needed training. Mr Obama also referred to the civil war in South Sudan ahead of talks with regional leaders on the issue. Government and rebels leaders were \\"extremely stubborn\\", and other \\"tools\\" would have to be considered if there was no breakthrough in ending the conflict, he added. The 19-month war in South Sudan has left thousands of people dead and displaced more than two million. On Tuesday, Mr Obama will also be the first US leader to address the 54-member African Union in Addis Ababa.

The colon plays a vital role in the final stages of food digestion, and any obstruction within it can hamper the natural process. To understand the answer better, let's delve deeper into the roles of the colon in digestion and how a blockage in the colon would affect it. The colon, also known as the large intestine, is a critical component of the digestive system with the following primary functions: 1. Water and electrolyte absorption: The colon's first function is to absorb excess water, electrolytes, and some vitamins produced by enteric bacteria. This absorption helps solidify the remaining waste material, known as feces. 2. Bacterial fermentation: The colon houses plenty of beneficial bacteria that aid in the fermentation of any undigested carbohydrates, proteins, and other substances. This process produces essential nutrients, such as short-chain fatty acids, which supply energy to the cells lining the large intestine. 3. Waste storage and expulsion: After the above steps, the remaining waste material is stored in the rectum, the final section of the large intestine. When the body is ready for a bowel movement, the waste is expelled through the anus. Now, consider a blockage occurring in the colon, making it smaller. This obstruction could lead to the following consequences: a. Limited space: The blockage reduces the colon's capacity to hold and process waste material, hindering the proper absorption of water and electrolytes. This limitation could result in diarrhea and dehydration due to the excess water not being absorbed. b. Delayed transit time: With limited space, the movement of undigested food through the colon slows down, affecting the fermentation process. This delay in transit time could lead to constipation and accumulation of gases, causing discomfort and bloating. c. Malabsorption of nutrients: If the blockage is severe, the colon's ability to absorb necessary vitamins and short-chain fatty acids produced by bacterial fermentation can be compromised. This malabsorption could lead to nutritional deficiencies and negatively affect the overall health of the individual. In conclusion, a blockage that makes the colon smaller would significantly impact the normal digestion process, ultimately leading to less food being digested. Possible consequences include diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and malabsorption of vital nutrients."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Knievel was born on October 17, 1938, in Butte, Montana, the first of two children of Robert E. and Ann Marie Keough Knievel. His surname is of German origin; his paternal great-great-grandparents emigrated to the United States from Germany. His mother was of Irish ancestry. Robert and Ann divorced in 1940, after the 1939 birth of their second child, Nicolas, known as Nic. ABC's Wide World of Sports was unwilling to pay the price Knievel wanted for the Snake River Canyon jump, so he hired boxing promoter Bob Arum's company, Top Rank Productions, to put the event on closed-circuit television and broadcast to movie theaters. Investors in the event took a substantial loss, including promoter Don E. Branker, as well as Vince McMahon of the World Wrestling Federation. Arum partnered with Invest West Sports, Shelly Saltman's company, to secure from Invest West Sports two things: first, the necessary financing for the jump, and second, the services of Saltman, long recognized as one of America's premier public relations and promotion men, to do publicity so that Knievel could concentrate on his jumps. Knievel hired subcontractor and aeronautical engineer Doug Malewicki to build him a rocket-powered cycle to jump across the Snake River, and called it the Skycycle X-1. Malwecki's creation was powered by a steam engine built by former Aerojet engineer Robert Truax. On April 15, 1972, the X-1 was launched to test the feasibility of the launching ramp. The decision was then made to have Truax build the Skycycle X-2 and have it take off and fly more like a rocket than a motorcycle.  The launch took place at the south rim of the Snake River Canyon, west of Shoshone Falls (42.597degN 114.423degW / 42.597; -114.423), on Sunday, September 8, 1974, at 3:36 p.m. MDT. The steam that powered the engine was superheated to a temperature of 500 degF (260 degC). The drogue parachute prematurely deployed as the Skycycle left the launching rail and induced significant drag. Even though the craft made it all the way across the canyon to the north rim, the prevailing northwest winds caused it to drift back into the canyon. By the time it hit the bottom of the canyon, it landed only a few feet from the water on the same side of the canyon from which it had been launched. If he had landed in the water, Knievel likely would have drowned, due to a jumpsuit/harness malfunction which kept him strapped in the vehicle. He survived the jump with only minor injuries.  Since the 1974 launch, seven daredevils have expressed interest in recreating the jump, including Knievel's two sons, Robbie and Kelly. In 2010 Robbie announced he would recreate the jump. Stuntman Eddie Braun announced he was working with Kelly and Robert Truax's son to recreate the jump using a replica of the Skycycle X-2. Braun's jump took place on September 16, 2016, and was completed successfully. when was the launch?","output":"The launch of the Skycycle X-2, when Knievel tried to jump across the Snake River Canyon, happened on Sunday, September 8, 1974, at 3:36 p.m. MDT."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: Quantum dots (QD) are semiconductor nanocrystals that possess unique optical properties. Their emission color can be tuned from the visible throughout the infrared spectrum. This allows quantum dot LEDs to create almost any color on the CIE diagram. This provides more color options and better color rendering than white LEDs since the emission spectrum is much narrower, characteristic of quantum confined states. There are two types of schemes for QD excitation. One uses photo excitation with a primary light source LED (typically blue or UV LEDs are used).

Diana Scott is a beautiful, bored young model married to Tony Bridges. One day, Diana meets Robert Gold, a literary interviewer/director for television arts programmes, by chance when she is spotted on the street by his roving film crew and interviewed by him about young people's views on convention. Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio and there their relationship starts. After liaisons in bleak hotel rooms they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple, they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set. Initially, Diana is jealous when Robert sees his wife while visiting his children, but she quickly loses this attachment when she mixes with the predatory males of the media, arts and advertising scene, particularly Miles Brand, a powerful advertising executive for the \\"Glass Corporation\\" who gets her a part in a trashy thriller after she has sex with him. The bookish Robert prefers the quiet life; it is he who now becomes jealous, but increasingly detached, depressed and lonely. Diana attends a high-class charity draw for world hunger for which she is the face.

Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship.

John Hickenlooper signed the Civil Unions Act into law at the Colorado History Museum in Denver, Colo., on Thursday, March... (Associated Press)      The attitude across the country toward gay rights has been shifting toward acceptance, despite many conservatives' insistence that officially recognized unions, especially marriage, should be only between one man and one woman.      The Supreme Court is set to soon hear arguments in two major cases on gay rights, including a challenge to the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as being between one man and one woman, and a challenge to California's ban on gay marriage.      Depending on how broadly the court wants to tailor its decisions, they could affect the status of gay rights in all states.      With Thursday's action, Colorado will join eight U.S. states that have civil unions or similar laws. Nine states and the District of Columbia allow gay marriage. The law takes effect May 1.      Hundreds looked on as Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper signed the bill, with many chanting \\"Equal! Equal!\\"      \\"There is no excuse that people shouldn't have all the same rights,\\" Hickenlooper told the crowd.      Civil unions grant gay couples rights similar to marriage, including enhanced inheritance and parental rights. People in civil unions also would have the ability to make medical decisions for their partners.      \\"It means I can change my name finally,\\" said 21-year-old Amber Fuentes, who plans to have a civil union with Yolanda Martinez, 34.      \\"It's not marriage, but it still gives us a lot of the rights,\\" Martinez said.      A Pew Research Center survey found that 49 percent of Americans favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally, and 44 percent are opposed. A decade ago, 58 percent opposed it and a third supported it.      \\"It's really meaningful. To have the recognition of your love and relationship just like any other relationship by the state is an important both legal and symbolic thing,\\" said Democratic House Speaker Mark Ferrandino, a sponsor of the bill and the first openly gay lawmaker to hold the title of speaker in Colorado.      Most Republicans opposed the bill, saying they would've liked to see religious exemptions to provide legal protections for those opposed to civil unions. Churches are shielded under the new law, but Democrats rejected protections for businesses and adoption agencies, arguing the Republican suggestions were too broad and could provide legal cover to discriminate.      ___      Find Ivan Moreno on Twitter: http://twitter.com/IvanJourno ||||| Amid cheers and tears, Gov. John Hickenlooper on Thursday signed a civil-unions bill into law, erasing a generation of anguish for supporters of gay rights in what once was dubbed \\"the hate state.\\"      \\"Unbelievable,\\" Hickenlooper said, looking at the gays and straight allies who were crammed into the History Colorado Center to watch history being made.      Sen. Pat Steadman of Denver, one of four gay Democrats who sponsored Senate Bill 11, recalled that \\"painful\\" night when voters approved Amendment 2, which prohibited laws from protecting gays from discrimination.      \\"I was there on election night in 1992 with many of you, and I see your faces in this room,\\" he said. \\"That was a very tragic moment, and yet it gave us so much hope and so much momentum moving forward. We didn't take that defeat sitting down. We were in the streets, and we were in the courtrooms, and we were in the halls of the Capitol building.\\"      Steadman quoted from U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion in 1996 that overturned Amendment 2.      \\"He wrote, 'A state cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws,' \\" Steadman said.      The atmosphere at the bill-signing was electric, with huge cheers when lawmakers and the governor took to the small stage. Senate Bill 11 gives same-sex couples many but not all of the rights and responsibilities of marriage. It goes into effect May 1.      \\"Dearly beloved,\\" Steadman said before the crowd erupted, forcing him to pause before he continued, \\"we're going to make history.\\"      Steadman and another gay Denver Democrat, Rep. Mark Ferrandino, have sponsored the civil measures for three years, but the bills died in the previous two sessions when Republicans controlled the House. Last year's bill died a dramatic death although Democrats had enough votes to get it passed through the House.      Democrats won back the House majority in November. This year, Steadman and Ferrandino were joined by two other gay sponsors: Rep. Sue Schafer, D-Wheat Ridge, and Sen. Lucia Guzman, D-Denver.      \\"What a great day to be a Coloradan,\\" Schafer said.      Ferrandino, who now is the House speaker, recognized the \\"courageous Republicans in the House and the Senate who were willing to stand up and do the right thing.\\"      The GOP senators who voted for civil unions last year, this year or both are Ellen Roberts of Durango, Jean White of Hayden and Nancy Spence of Centennial. The GOP House supporters are Reps. B.J. Nikkel of Loveland, Don Beezley of Broomfield, Cheri Gerou of Evergreen and Carole Murray of Castle Rock.      PHOTOS: Colorado Gov. Hickenlooper signs the civil unions bill      Gerou waved at Ferrandino when he called her name.      \\"I kept saying it wasn't a matter of if; it was a matter of when,\\" Ferrandino said. \\"It's an amazing day to be here.\\"      The speaker said the bill has always been personal but that it has ever more meaning now that he and his partner, Greg Wertsch, have a 15-month-old foster daughter.      \\"When I wake up and I go and take her out of her crib and see that smiling face, to know that after the governor signs (the bill) she's going to have the protections just like every other family makes my heart warm,\\" Ferrandino said.      Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper planned a news conference at the History Colorado Center. (Craig F. Walker, The Denver Post)      Hickenlooper, a former geologist who started Wynkoop Brewing Co. after the oil bust in the 1980s, said that in the early 1990s a gay employee was promoted to general manager. When a couple of customers asked to speak to the owner about the manager, Hickenlooper thought they were going to say what a good job the manager was doing.      \\"They said they weren't going to come to our business anymore,\\" the governor recalled. \\"One of our waitresses was standing beside me, and she said, 'You know, that's not going to bother any of us at all.' \\"      The anecdote drew laughs, but Hickenlooper talked about how attitudes have changed over time.      \\"It is a moment that the whole community has waited for for so long,\\" the governor said.      One of his staffers tweeted: \\"From hate state to great state?\\"      But Steadman said the civil-unions bill is \\"admittedly imperfect.\\"      \\"It is not an extension of equal rights. It is not something that includes us fully and on equal footing with others in society,\\" he said. \\"There is still much to do.\\"      Full equality is marriage, Steadman, Ferrandino and others have said, but a constitutional amendment voters passed in 2006 recognizes marriage as only between a man and a woman.      Steadman deliberately chose the number of this year's civil-unions measure: Senate Bill 11.      His partner, Dave Misner, who died last September after a brief battle with pancreatic cancer, was born on May 11. They had been together 11 years. Some of those who attended the civil-unions signing wore the same purple ribbons they wore at Misner's funeral.      After civil unions passed this year, Steadman wrote a poem:      11 is a prime number.      Eleven is a lovely word.      It's binary; a pair of ones.      It's two like things, bound together,      to make a whole of ones.

If your baby can fit something in his mouth, there is a chance he could choke on it. Make sure any small objects are kept up off the floor and out of your baby's reach. Possible answers:  + Regularly vacuum your living room floor to pick up any small items you might not notice visually. Even items like deflated latex balloons or forgotten paperclips could lead to a choking hazard if they are left on the floor for your baby to find and ingest.  + Nothing will induce the baby to eat down if something gets in his mouth. Some appliance manufacturers use extra-strong adhesives, like polypropylene, that will get under the cords.  + You can also protect your baby from small objects by placing toy legos out of reach. Another option you can try is to purchase an empty toy box, or cardboard box, that you can use as a mattress.  + Tiny items that he could sip from can help release the child's gas. Provide a safe bench for your baby to sit on.","output":"One of the essential aspects of childproofing a living room is ensuring that all potential hazards are addressed to create a safe environment for your child. In addition to keeping floors and low surfaces free of small objects, there are several other steps you can take to further childproof your living room: 1. Cover electrical outlets: Use outlet covers or safety plugs to prevent your child from inserting their fingers or other objects into electrical outlets. 2. Secure heavy furniture: Anchor large furniture such as bookcases, TVs, and cabinets to the wall to prevent them from tipping over if your child attempts to climb on them. 3. Install safety gates: Install baby gates at the entrances to the living room to prevent your child from wandering into other areas of the house unsupervised. 4. Cushion sharp edges: Use corner guards or padding to cover sharp edges on furniture to minimize the risk of injury if your child accidentally bumps into them. 5. Remove dangling cords: Secure cords from blinds, curtains, and appliances to prevent your child from becoming entangled in them or accidentally pulling something onto themselves. 6. Store dangerous items out of reach: Keep items such as matches, lighters, and cleaning products in locked cabinets or on high shelves that your child cannot access. 7. Clear pathways: Ensure that walkways are free from clutter and tripping hazards, such as cords, toys, and shoes. 8. Secure rugs and mats: Use non-slip pads or double-sided tape to secure rugs and mats to the floor, preventing your child from slipping and potentially injuring themselves. 9. Install window locks and guards: To prevent falls, lock windows and install window guards or stops that prevent windows from opening more than a few inches. 10. Childproofing fireplace: If you have a fireplace, use a fireplace screen or gate to keep your child at a safe distance. Make sure any fireplace tools or accessories are stored securely out of reach.

Question: You are given a new situation: Due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere more an more carbon dioxide is mixing with ocean water - thus increasing the acidity of the world's oceans. Rob is a climate scientist. He is measuring the acidity of the Atlantic ocean and the Pacific Ocean. To determine ocean water acidity he performed an acid-base titration. His conclusion is that Atlantic Ocean's acidity reached higher level than Pacific Ocean's acidity.  and a hint : To determine the concentration of an acid in an aqueous solution, an acid-base titration is commonly performed. A strong base solution with a known concentration, usually NaOH or KOH, is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added.[7] The titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes, with the base volume on the x-axis and the solution's pH value on the y-axis. The pH of the solution always goes up as the base is added to the solution.  Please answer this question : In which ocean's acidity test Rob would have to add less base, Atlantic Ocean or Pacific ocean? Answer:","output":"In Rob's acidity test, he would have to add less base in the Atlantic Ocean's sample. This is because the acidity level in the Atlantic Ocean is higher than that of the Pacific Ocean, as mentioned in the given situation. When an acid is titrated with a base, the goal is to neutralize the acid with the base until an equivalent point is reached, which is when equal amounts of acid and base have reacted with each other. Given that the Atlantic Ocean has a higher acidity level, it would therefore contain a higher concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) and, consequently, a stronger acidic solution. When titrating this ocean water sample, the stronger acidity of the solution would mean that fewer moles of base (either NaOH or KOH) are needed to react with the acid in order to reach the equivalent point and neutralize the acidity. As a result, a lesser amount of base would be added in this titration process. On the other hand, the Pacific Ocean has a lower acidity level, indicating a lower concentration of hydrogen ions and a weaker acidic solution. To neutralize its acidity during titration, more moles of base would be required to react with the acid present in this solution, resulting in a greater volume of base being added. In conclusion, Rob would have to add less base when conducting the acid-base titration in the Atlantic Ocean's water sample, due to its higher acidity level compared to the Pacific Ocean. The greater acidity in the Atlantic Ocean requires fewer moles of the strong base to reach the equivalent point, subsequently neutralizing the solution's acidity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Bad stuff Review: Growing up, I was exposed to a good deal of Gordon Lightfoot from my parents. No Lightfoot album got played more than this. It might explain why I dislike Lightfoot today. His folksy ramblings and easy-to-mock voice are slight annoyances. If you combine them with a horrid must-be-the-'80s adult contemporary sound, you got something bad: this album. While some tunes are passable, like \\"Tag Along\\", others sound dated as all out. Most offensive are \\"Stay Loose\\", \\"You Just Gotta Be\\", \\"Ecstasy Made Easy\\". The WORST tune on here has got to be \\"Anything For Love\\", with the worst elements of a/c: faceless synths, back-ups, and the rest. It was co-written with David Foster, which would explain the track's similarities to his icky Love Theme from St. Elmo's Fire. If Lightfoot had a worst album ever, it would be this one.

Corker: Obama 'irresponsible' with Congress House Speaker John Boehner invited the Israeli prime minister to address Congress next month without either side consulting the White House before Netanyahu accepted the invitation, setting off sparks in an Obama administration that felt snubbed. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest called the planning for the visit a \\"departure\\" from protocol and comes amid tensions between the White House and Senators of both parties who want to pass a bill authorizing new sanctions on Iran -- a harder line Netanyahu has publicly supported. But Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, also suggested Tuesday that Netanyahu's visit would be less divisive by the time he arrives for his joint address to Congress. Corker wouldn't take a firm position on whether the unilateral invitation -- orchestrated by aides in Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's offices -- was the right thing to do. RELATED: Netanyahu coming to Congress in March \\"At the end of the day, that's not my call,\\" he told CNN's \\"New Day\\". \\"There's a lot of water that will go under the bridge between now and the time that he arrives and my guess is we may be in a place where thing are aligned in a very good way.\\" Corker is currently leading the push for a bill in the foreign affairs committee that would require Congressional oversight over an eventual deal with Iran while Sens. Bob Menendez (D-New Jersey) and Mark Kirk (R-Illinois) will push another bill through the banking committee next week that would hang a new set of sanctions on Iran's head if a deal isn't reached by the July deadline. Sens. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) and Barbara Boxer (D-California) also announced Wednesday that they are crafting a more moderate sanctions bill to counter the Kirk-Menendez bill. But by the time Netanyahu comes to visit, Corker suggested that Congress, the White House and Israel's conservative leader would likely be more in sync over how to strengthen the U.S.'s negotiating position with Iran ahead of an initial March 1 and final July 1 deadline for Iran to deal with the U.S. and five other world powers regarding its nuclear program. \\"He's incredibly concerned about a bad deal with Iran, very concerned about where these negotiations are going,\\" Corker said. \\"I don't know that he'll be necessarily going against the President.\\" That may be even more likely as Boehner's office announced Thursday morning that Netanyahu asked to push his visit back a month, now set to speak on March , giving him a chance to also address the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's high-profile annual conference. His speech to Congress will now come just 12 days before Netanyahu appears on ballots in Israeli elections -- a visit that will bolster his status as a strong leader with firm backing in the United States for his policies. Netanyahu may also have to come to terms with information from his own intelligence service, which told a group of U.S. senators visiting Israel last week, including Corker, that a sanctions bill would threaten negotiations, according to a Bloomberg report and similar remarks made by Secretary of State John Kerry.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Plants start growing on or near the rocks - The roots of the growing plants start to break up the rock - The plant acids dissolve the rock - The rock is broken down into smaller pieces - Erosion begins.  suppose more acid dissolves rock happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER erosion of rocks.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation in the given scenario of more acid dissolving the rock can be described as directly impacting a step of the process. To understand why this is classified as a direct impact, let's analyze the steps involved in the erosion process and how the increased amount of acid can lead to more or faster erosion of rocks. The process of erosion in relation to plants growing on or near rocks can be broken down into the following steps: 1. Plants start growing on or near the rocks: In the initial stage, plants find suitable locations to grow, often on or near rocky surfaces where competition for resources is low or limited. 2. The roots of the growing plants start to break up the rock: As the plants grow, their roots penetrate the rocky substrate, exerting pressure and mechanically fragmenting the rock into smaller pieces. 3. The plant acids dissolve the rock: Many plants produce organic acids that can help dissolve or chemically weather the minerals in the rock, further breaking it down into smaller particles. 4. The rock is broken down into smaller pieces: As a result of the mechanical and chemical weathering caused by plant growth and plant acids, the rock fragments into smaller and more manageable pieces. 5. Erosion begins: Once the rock has been broken down, various natural forces such as water, wind, and gravity can transport and redistribute the smaller particles, leading to erosion. In the proposed scenario, more acid dissolves the rock, indicating an increase in the production or amount of plant acids. Considering that plant acids play a significant role in dissolving and chemically weathering the rock (as seen in step 3 of the process), an increase in their concentration will directly impact the rate at which rocks are broken down. This will, in turn, lead to an accelerated rate of erosion, as smaller rock particles are more susceptible to erosion than larger, more cohesive rocks. In summary, the supposed perturbation of more acid dissolving the rock can be identified as directly impacting a step of the process, specifically the step where plant acids dissolve the rock. By increasing the rate of chemical weathering, the increased amount of plant acids contributes to more or faster erosion of rocks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

These two questions do not have the same meaning but are, in fact, related to the same concept within the Harry Potter series. They address different aspects of the concept of a Horcrux. Let's dive into the details of each question to understand their differences. Question 1: Why did Harry become a Horcrux? This question seeks to understand the reason and circumstances that led to Harry Potter inadvertently becoming a Horcrux. To answer this question, we need to delve into the backstory of Harry Potter and how he came to be a Horcrux. In the Harry Potter series, a Horcrux is an object that contains a piece of a dark wizard's soul. The main antagonist, Lord Voldemort, created multiple Horcruxes in a bid to achieve immortality. By splitting his soul and hiding the pieces in different objects, he ensured that if one part of his soul was destroyed, the other parts would keep him alive. The circumstances of Harry becoming a Horcrux were accidental. When Voldemort tried to kill baby Harry, the Killing Curse rebounded, destroying Voldemort's body and causing part of his torn soul to latch onto the only living thing in the room - Harry. Unknowingly, Harry carried the piece of Voldemort's soul inside him throughout his life until the Battle of Hogwarts when the Horcrux was ultimately destroyed. Question 2: What is a Horcrux? This question aims at understanding the general concept of a Horcrux within the Harry Potter universe. A Horcrux, in J.K. Rowling's created world, is an object or living being in which a responsible dark wizard hides a fragment of his or her soul. By doing this, they aim to achieve immortality and protect themselves from death. Creating a Horcrux involves committing murder, which is considered the most heinous of acts, as it rips the soul apart, allowing a part of it to be stored in the designated object. To sum up, the two questions have distinct meanings. Question 1 looks into the specific scenario of why Harry Potter became a Horcrux, while Question 2 seeks a general definition and explanation of what a Horcrux is in the Harry Potter series. They are related but are not synonymous in their meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

If your cat is vomiting, has diarrhea, isn’t breathing normally, or has an irregular heartbeat, get to the vet’s office as quickly as possible.  If you see your cat licking itself before you have a chance to remove the motor oil, go to the vet. If your vet’s office isn’t open, go to an emergency vet clinic. Do not attempt to make your cat vomit before you visit the vet! Some products can actually permanently damage your cat’s esophagus. Your cat will be clipped and bathed at the vet’s office, just as it would have been at home. Depending on your cat’s condition, your vet will either do this right away or take care of urgent medical issues first. The vet may also provide you will topical antibiotics that you’ll need to put on your cat’s skin to prevent infection. The vet will order a complete blood profile, a urine test, and an electrolyte panel. Each of these tests will help your vet determine which of your cat’s organs are being affected by the motor oil. Since motor oil can sometimes cause pneumonia in cats, your vet may also order an X-ray to see if your cat has built-up fluid in its lungs. If your cat vomited at home, take a sample of the vomit for your vet to test. You can collect it with a resealable plastic bag. Be sure to wash your hands after you’ve gotten the sample. This may help your vet treat your cat more quickly. The charcoal will help absorb the motor oil and halt any damage it’s causing in your cat’s system. If your cat ate the motor oil recently, your vet may also flush your cat’s stomach. If your cat is struggling to breathe, oxygen therapy may help stabilize it while the motor oil is removed from its system. This treatment can only be given at your vet’s office, so your cat will need to stay there for as long as the oxygen therapy is necessary. Sometimes IV fluids will also be given to support the cat's internal organs. If your vet allowed you to take your cat home, you’re probably in the clear. However, it’s a good idea to monitor them closely for the next several days to make sure they’re healing from their ordeal. If you see them panting, coughing, or if they have an increased heart rate, take them back to the vet right away.

Options: a ) 4096 , b ) 4098 , c ) 5000 , d ) 5096 , e ) can not be determined Student:","output":"Let the side of the square of the garden last year be x units, and the side of the square this year be y units. Then, the area of the garden last year was x^2 square feet, and the area of the garden this year was y^2 square feet. Since the lady increased her output by 127 cabbages, so the difference in the area is 127 square feet. This can be represented as: y^2 - x^2 = 127 We can rewrite the equation as a difference of squares: (y + x)(y - x) = 127 Now, we have to find two factors of 127 that have a difference equal to the number of cabbages added. Since 127 is a prime number, the only factors are 1 and 127. So, y + x = 127 and y - x = 1 Solve these two equations for y and x: y = 64 x = 63 So, last year's garden had a side of 63 feet, and this year's garden had a side of 64 feet. Number of cabbages produced this year = y^2 = 64^2 = 4096. Thus, the answer is a) 4096 cabbages."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Paragraph: Bacterial and viral infections often present with similar symptoms. Etiologic misdiagnosis can alter the trajectory of patient care, including antibiotic overuse. A host-protein signature comprising tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), interferon gamma-induced protein-10 (IP-10), and C-reactive protein (CRP) was validated recently for differentiating bacterial from viral disease. However, a focused head-to-head comparison of its diagnostic performance against other biomarker candidates for this indication was lacking in patients with respiratory infection and fever without source. We compared the signature to other biomarkers and prediction rules using specimens collected prospectively at two secondary medical centers from children and adults. Inclusion criteria included fever > 37.5°C, symptom duration ≤ 12 days, and presentation with respiratory infection or fever without source. Comparator method was based on expert panel adjudication. Signature and biomarker cutoffs and prediction rules were predefined. Of 493 potentially eligible patients, 314 were assigned unanimous expert panel diagnosis and also had sufficient specimen volume. The resulting cohort comprised 175 (56%) viral and 139 (44%) bacterial infections. Signature sensitivity 93.5% (95% CI 89.1-97.9%), specificity 94.3% (95% CI 90.7-98.0%), or both were significantly higher (all p values < 0.01) than for CRP, procalcitonin, interleukin-6, human neutrophil lipocalin, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and prediction rules. Signature identified as viral 50/57 viral patients prescribed antibiotics, suggesting potential to reduce antibiotic overuse by 88%. The host-protein signature demonstrated superior diagnostic performance in differentiating viral from bacterial respiratory infections and fever without source. Future utility studies are warranted to validate potential to reduce antibiotic overuse.

The book was started by Hugh Beaver from Britain. In 1951, he went shooting birds and talked with his friends about the fastest bird in Europe. Three years later, they were still talking about it. So Beaver believed that people must have different ideas. So, he decided to start a book to record the world's truly greatest people and things in it! The newest book came out last Tuesday.

President Xi Jinping in his opening speech paid tribute to \\"the Chinese people who unwaveringly fought hard and defeated aggression\\" from Japan. He also said the People's Liberation Army would be reduced by 300,000 personnel, but gave no timeframe. China's growing military power is being keenly watched amid regional tensions. China has several territorial disputes with neighbours in the South China Sea, as well as with Japan in the East China Sea. Ahead of the parade, the US said five Chinese ships had been spotted in the Bering Sea off Alaska for the first time. China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is the world's largest military, with 2.3 million members. China also has the second biggest defence budget after the US. More than 30 foreign government officials and heads of state including Russia's President Vladimir Putin and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon attended the event. But many Western leaders and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have stayed away. Some 12,000 troops and 200 aircraft, as well as tanks and missiles, were on display in Tiananmen Square, including the anti-ship \\"carrier killer\\" missile Dongfeng-21D. Most of the war machinery on display was being shown to the general public for the first time, according to state media. Mr Xi, also the commander of the armed forces, was centre stage at the parade's proceedings. Despite the repeated assurances from China that the message of today was one of peace, the crowd seemed to see a different symbolism in the V-shaped lines of jets and bombers. \\"We have the ability to announce to the world that we are a big country, we are a great country,\\" one onlooker told me. \\"It is the proper time to show to the world that we are strong now,\\" a young woman agreed. China believes that its suffering and sacrifice during World War Two have been largely forgotten. But 70 years on there are questions over whether the Communist Party is basking in reflected glory - after all it was the Nationalists who did most of the fighting and dying - and whether a contribution to world peace is really best marked by such an extraordinary display of military might. Mr Xi made the troop reduction announcement in a speech where he reassured the global community that \\"China will remain committed to peaceful development\\". \\"No matter how strong it becomes, China will never seek hegemony or expansion. It will never inflict its past suffering on any nation,\\" he said. BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie, who was at the parade, says the army cuts will not mean a weaker China. It is also upgrading its naval and air forces, she says, so does not need as many boots on the ground to project its power around the world. Alexander Neill from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in Singapore, says the move shows China's \\"determination to have a modern fighting force\\". In the build-up to the event, state media have published commentaries reinforcing Chinese patriotism and views on historical events. Entertainment shows were also suspended on television to make way for the coverage. Beijing's normally smoggy skies were unusually blue, after factories were closed, barbecues banned and cars stopped from travelling to reduce pollution. But concerns about China's growing military assertiveness and the tone of the parade meant many Western and Asian leaders stayed away from the event. \\"During a period of strained relations between China and Japan, as well as increasing military tension in the Asia-Pacific region, some leaders are reluctant to be associated with what they may view as a nationalistic, anti-Japanese mass rally,\\" says Mr Neill. Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China in 1937 and, according to Beijing, eight years of fighting claimed 14 million Chinese lives. China also claims that it is the \\"forgotten ally\\" and that its role in defeating Japan has been underplayed in the post-war narrative. Nationalist forces led the fight against Japan in China. They were defeated by Mao Zedong's Communists who proclaimed a people's republic in 1949.

A more detailed and appropriate answer to the question would be as follows: Eton College, an independent boarding school in Eton, Berkshire, England, features numerous learning buildings designed by various architects over the centuries since its founding in 1440 by King Henry VI. The earliest buildings, including the iconic College Chapel, were originally designed by architect Henry Yevele, although the Chapel was later modified by multiple architects throughout its history. In the late 17th century, Eton's Christopher Wren-designed School Yard and Upper School were constructed. Sir Christopher Wren, a prolific English architect and scientist, was responsible for numerous famous buildings, including St. Paul's Cathedral in London. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Eton College campus expanded further with the construction of several new buildings. One such building is the Lower School, designed by Edward Blore, an English architect known for his work on Buckingham Palace and Lambeth Palace.

Options:  A. police officer's belt  B. police station  C. traffic  D. war  E. pants The answer to this question is:","output":"D. War Desertion typically refers to the act of abandoning one's duty or post without permission, particularly in the context of military service. In some cases, officers may be tasked with carrying a pistol to shoot deserters in times of war, should they attempt to leave their post or flee the battlefield. The term \\"deserters\\" is not generally used in association with police officers, traffic situations, or other everyday circumstances. Historically, some military forces have employed harsh tactics, including execution, to discourage desertion and maintain discipline among their troops during wartime. However, it is important to remember that shooting deserters is a controversial and ethically complex issue, and modern approaches to handling desertion may involve legal and administrative processes rather than lethal force."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Title: excellent for children and parents alike Review: I first heard this book used in our children's church.

Just as he attempts to leap off the bridge, he is distracted by Milt Manville, an old friend from fifteen years ago. Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him.  As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does. As Milt and Linda start to settle down as a couple, she quickly realizes that he has an addiction to selling household items and junk for a quick buck, something that she is strongly against. She immediately dumps him, which leads to Milt to want Ellen back when he realizes how much he loves her for real. She admits that she doesn't really love Harry as much as she thought, as his bizarre day-to-day activities get to her.

(March 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) At Chicago O'Hare International Airport, a group of Marines have just returned to the US from Iraq. As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis (Manny PÃ©rez), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Alexis, and Alexis stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Alexis, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back then they make their way to Edy's store. Jesse's sister Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito) arrives by taxi, although everyone assumes she came in a limo because they all assume that she made it big in Hollywood as an actress.

Jeffrey Leonard Jarrett (born July 14, 1967) is an American professional wrestler, professional wrestling promoter and businessman. Beginning his career in his father's Continental Wrestling Association (CWA), in 1986, Jarrett first came to prominence upon debuting in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1992. Over the next nine years, he alternated between the WWF and its main competitor, World Championship Wrestling (WCW). After WCW was purchased by the WWF in 2001, Jarrett joined the upstart World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) promotion. In April, WCW was \\"rebooted\\" by Eric Bischoff and Vince Russo, with all titles vacated as a result. Bischoff and Russo also created The New Blood, a stable of younger wrestlers who feuded with the Millionaire's Club, made up of the older members of the WCW roster. Jarrett joined The New Blood, and at Spring Stampede on April 16, he defeated Millionaires Club member Diamond Dallas Page to win the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Page regained the title on April 24, and on April 25, the title was contested in a tag team match pitting Jarrett and Bischoff against Page and actor David Arquette. Arquette won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship after pinning Bischoff. Jarrett hit Page with the championship belt while special referee Kimberly Page's back was turned; WCW official Mickie Jay counted Bischoff out while Jarrett had Page pinned, who kicked out. At Slamboree on May 7, Jarrett defeated Page and Arquette in a three way triple cage match to win his second WCW World Heavyweight Championship after Arquette turned on Page.  In May, Jarrett won and lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on two further occasions, regaining the title from Ric Flair both times. Jarrett feuded with Nash and Hulk Hogan throughout June 2000, and on July 9 at Bash at the Beach, he faced Hogan with the world championship on the line; the match ended swiftly after Jarrett immediately laid down, allowing Hogan to rest a boot on his chest and win the title, with Hogan commenting, \\"That's why this company is in the damn shape it's in--because of bullshit like this!\\". Vince Russo subsequently came to the ring and delivered a profanity-laced interview in which he accused Hogan of politicking and claimed that Hogan had used his creative control to refuse to lose to Jarrett. Russo then stated that, while Hogan was free to keep the title belt he had just won (the \\"Hulk Hogan Memorial Belt\\"), Jarrett would wrestle Booker T for the official WCW World Heavyweight Championship later that night. Booker T won the resultant match and Hogan did not appear in WCW again. It is disputed whether the situation was a shoot, a work, or some combination of the two.  In the following months, Jarrett briefly feuded with Booker T, Mike Awesome, Sting, Buff Bagwell, and Flair. In late 2000, he joined forces with the Harris Brothers once more, with the trio defeating The Filthy Animals at Starrcade on December 17. In the same evening, Jarrett aligned himself with WCW World Heavyweight Champion Scott Steiner by helping Steiner defeat Sid Vicious.  In 2001, Jarrett and Steiner became members of The Magnificent Seven, a large stable headed by Flair. Flair and Jarrett feuded with Dusty and Dustin Rhodes until March, when WCW was purchased by the WWF.  Uninterested in Jarrett, the WWF neglected to acquire his contract, leaving him without a job. On the March 26 episode of the WWF's Raw program (which coincided with the final episode of Nitro), company owner Vince McMahon was seen watching Jarrett within the WCW venue on a television set. McMahon announced Jarrett's real-life firing on air, mocking his trademark taunt of distinctly spelling out his name by saying that he would now be known as \\"Capital G, Double-O, Double-N, Double-E - GOONNEE!\\" Entity:","output":"The text is about Jeffrey Leonard Jarrett, an American professional wrestler, professional wrestling promoter, and businessman."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Andrea Chisholm, 54, pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting wrongfully obtained public assistance, claiming that her husband, Colin Chisholm III, filled out the bogus welfare applications. Despite living a lavish lifestyle that included a lakefront home, a 1.2 million yacht, and a kennel that bred elite Cavalier King Charles spaniels, the Chisholms shamelessly took advantage of public assistance programs. Prosecutors noted that the couple collected a staggering 167,000 in food stamps and medical claims through these fraudulent applications. During the sentencing, Andrea Chisholm expressed remorse for her actions, stating that it was her husband who should bear most of the blame for the deception. Regardless of who completed the false applications, however, the case stands as a stark reminder that people of all backgrounds and social classes can commit fraud and misuse public funds. The sentencing of Andrea Chisholm reinforces the importance of vigilance in detecting and deterring welfare fraud. Safeguarding public funds is a critical responsibility, as these resources are intended to provide essential assistance to the most vulnerable members of society. Cases like that of the Chisholms serve as a reminder of the need to continue fighting against fraud in public benefit programs and ensuring those who truly need support can receive it."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Aubrey kept an eye on Ash's things when he was away from town.

She pulled out the elegant white tablecloth reserved for special occasions and began to ponder the details for an attractive table setting. The warmth and happiness of their guests was important to both Christine and Lindsey. Lindsey started by spreading the tablecloth smoothly over their large oak dining table. The fabric cascaded effortlessly over the edges, giving the area a sophisticated feel. She took a moment to appreciate the transformation before proceeding to the next step. Next, Lindsey went to their mother's china cabinet and retrieved the precious blue and white porcelain dinner set that had been handed down through generations. The delicate plates, adorned with intricate patterns, had a timeless quality to them. As she placed them on the table, she couldn't help but think of all the cherished family memories and gatherings that had surrounded these heirlooms. The silverware was the next item on her list. She found the antique set her parents received as a wedding gift, polished it, and began arranging it on the table. The forks, knives, and spoons shone brightly as they caught the light streaming in from the large bay window in the dining room. Lindsey then shifted her attention to glassware. She picked out a set of sparkling crystal wine glasses, a gift from Christine's in-laws that had never been used. They had been waiting for the perfect occasion to showcase their beauty and elegance, and tonight seemed like the ideal opportunity. Now that the table setting essentials were in place, Lindsey moved on to the decorative aspects. She went out into their garden and picked a handful of fresh flowers, a mixture of roses, daisies, and lavender, to create an aromatic and visually stunning centerpiece. The colorful arrangement brightened up the table and added a touch of natural beauty. She also decided to light a few scented candles to evoke a cozy and inviting ambiance. Lindsey could hear Christine bustling around in the kitchen, preparing an array of delicious dishes for their guests. The aroma of baked garlic bread, chicken parmesan, and mushroom risotto wafted into the dining room, making her mouth water in anticipation. Completing the table, Lindsey added a few more personalized touches. She handpicked elegant cloth napkins in a shade of blue that complemented the porcelain dinnerware and tied them with strips of white satin ribbon. For a final touch, she wrote out name cards for each guest and set them down in their allotted spots. As Lindsey stepped back to take in her masterpiece, Christine appeared at the doorway with a satisfied smile. Their combined efforts had created a warm, welcoming atmosphere, and they both knew their guests would be thrilled with the results. And as the doorbell rang, both sisters exchanged excited glances, ready to embark on a memorable evening filled with laughter, love, and good company."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The second group of antelope, group B, have shorter necks and weaker teeth. Because of their longer necks and stronger teeth, the antelope from group A are more easily able to pick fruit and leaves from the tall trees in the region compared to antelope from group B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which group of antelope is less adapted to the environment? The answer is:","output":"Group B. Step-by-step justification: 1. Read and understand the given question and paragraph: The paragraph describes two groups of antelope and their distinct physical features that affect their ability to adapt to their environment. 2. Identify the key features of each group: Antelope from group A have long necks and strong teeth, while antelope from group B have shorter necks and weaker teeth. 3. Consider how these features might affect the groups' abilities to survive in the sub-Saharan Africa environment: Antelope from group A can more easily pick fruit and leaves from tall trees in the region due to their longer necks and stronger teeth. These features give them an advantage in obtaining food resources and overall survival. 4. Compare the adaptation of both groups to the environment: The described environment has tall trees and, likely, abundant fruit and leaves. Antelope from group A are better suited to obtain food sources in this environment, given their physical characteristics. Conversely, antelope from group B struggle to reach food from tall trees, making them less adapted to the prevailing environmental conditions. 5.

By Julian Robinson A previously unseen letter by Albert Einstein has revealed the genius was once corrected - by a 23-year-old student. Herbert Salzer was studying for a Master’s degree in physics when he wrote to Einstein to point out that an equation in one of his published papers was actually wrong. The eminent German physicist initially politely dismissed the claim, replying to the young student with a long-winded and mathematical defence of his work. In a previously unseen letter, Albert Einstein, pictured right, admitted to Herbert Salzer, pictured left, that he had made a mistake He concluded ‘I will now show that equation is really, really not the equation you specified’ before signing off 'Yours respectfully, A. Einstein'. 'The tone of the second letter is not of annoyance but one of excitement that OPTIONS: - A.

As it turns out, Salzer's correction to Einstein's equation was indeed valid, and the two continued to correspond with each other for several weeks, exchanging ideas, theories, and mathematical proofs. Salzer's aptitude for unraveling complex ideas caught the attention of Einstein, who recognized the potential in the young student's work. Over time, the conversations between Einstein and Salzer evolved into a mentoring relationship, wherein Einstein offered guidance, criticism, and encouragement to the aspiring physicist. As Salzer continued to progress academically, he began contributing to Einstein's ongoing research on the elusive unified field theory. This theory aimed to combine the fundamental forces of the universe, namely gravity and electromagnetism, into a single, comprehensive framework. During their collaboration, the pair uncovered new possibilities and drew closer to the realization of a unified field theory. Their efforts, however, were interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, as scientific resources and priorities shifted across the globe. As a result, their work was put on hold, and the two gradually lost touch with one another. Despite the setbacks, both Einstein and Salzer remained dedicated to the pursuit of a unified field theory, working independently throughout the remainder of their respective careers. Although neither of them succeeded in fully developing a cohesive framework for the forces of the universe, their contributions to the world of physics remain significant and noteworthy. In the decades following the war, Salzer emerged as a respected figure within the scientific community and advanced in his career through research and teaching positions at various institutions. While he always remained grateful for the opportunity to work with Einstein, he continued to forge his own path within the field of theoretical physics. The recently discovered letter serves as a testament to the inquisitive and intellectually humble nature of Einstein, who openly admitted and corrected his mistake after engaging in a detailed exchange with a young student. Furthermore, the story of the relationship between Einstein and Salzer highlights the importance of open dialogue, collaboration, and the ongoing pursuit of knowledge in the realm of scientific discovery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bush told skeptical foreign leaders and envoys Tuesday that Iraq was on its way to stability and democracy and called for  quot;a new definition of security  What best summarizes the content of the above article?","output":"The article primarily discusses President George W. Bush's address to foreign leaders and representatives, aiming to assuage their doubts regarding the political and social state of Iraq. President Bush expresses his optimistic view that Iraq is on the pathway to realizing stability and democracy. Beyond an update on Iraq's progress, his address also includes a call for a reimagined understanding of security in global politics. President Bush's message underscores the shift in the U.S. foreign policy towards nation-building and democracy promotion, particularly in the context of the post-9/11 era and the Iraq War. His comments reveal a belief that Iraq is successfully navigating its way towards becoming a stable democratic nation despite skepticism from the international community. In doing so, he is not only justifying the U.S. intervention in Iraq but also highlighting its potential positive outcomes. Moreover, by urging for \\"a new definition of security,\\" Bush is essentially asking global partners to reconsider their conceptions of international security to account for non-conventional threats such as terrorism, and perhaps to also consider the role of democratic institutions in enhancing global stability. This suggests a more holistic, preventative approach to international security that goes beyond traditional military power and includes political stability, democracy, and socio-economic development as key components of global security. It is important to note that the audience for Bush's address are skeptical foreign leaders and envoys, implying some prevailing doubts or disagreements about the trajectory of Iraq or the effectiveness of U.S. policies. The message, therefore, serves a dual purpose – to relay reassurances about Iraq's progress, and to encourage a revision of global security norms to include a wider range of considerations.    However, without more specific content from the article, key details—such as the nature of the skepticism from foreign leaders, the specific indicators of progress in Iraq that Bush cites, and the precise changes to the definition of security that Bush proposes—remain unknown.

Alex Werner, the curator of the Museum of London's \\"Dickens and London\\" exhibition, says the city was \\"absolutely central\\" to Dickens' work.  \\"It triggered his imagination,\\" he told CNN. \\"He called it his 'magic lantern', and would spend hours pacing the streets, drawing inspiration from what he saw around him.\\"  Read more: Dickens admirers mark bicentenary  London was Dickens' muse, helping to spark his creativity and provide ideas for some of the most memorable characters, settings and plot twists in English literature.

Please answer the following question: Q: The accumulation of what cells begin the development of the vertebral column and thoracic cage?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Development of the Vertebral Column and Thoracic cage Development of the vertebrae begins with the accumulation of mesenchyme cells from each sclerotome around the notochord. These cells differentiate into a hyaline cartilage model for each vertebra, which then grow and eventually ossify into bone through the process of endochondral ossification. As the developing vertebrae grow, the notochord largely disappears. However, small areas of notochord tissue persist between the adjacent vertebrae and this contributes to the formation of each intervertebral disc. The ribs and sternum also develop from mesenchyme. The ribs initially develop as part of the cartilage model for each vertebra, but in the thorax region, the rib portion separates from the vertebra by the eighth week. The cartilage model of the rib then ossifies, except for the anterior portion, which remains as the costal cartilage. The sternum initially forms as paired hyaline cartilage models on either side of the anterior midline, beginning during the fifth week of development. The cartilage models of the ribs become attached to the lateral sides of the developing sternum. Eventually, the two halves of the cartilaginous sternum fuse together along the midline and then ossify into bone. The manubrium and body of the sternum are converted into bone first, with the xiphoid process remaining as cartilage until late in life.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Reading is one of the most important keys for language development. Reading out loud teaches children what words are supposed to sound like: it teaches them to connect sounds with letters. The more words a baby hears, for example, the broader their vocabulary at age 3. Yes, you can simply talk to your infant to boost how many words they hear, but reading gives you words so that you don't have to think of things to say, and it teaches the baby new words. When you read to your child one-on-one, it adds to their perception of reading as a positive, nurturing activity. Not only that, it has been proven that reading out loud helps children cope with trauma. Reading out loud helps children return to reading later in life, both because it reminds them of happy times with parents and because it helped them through a hard time. Difficulty reading leads to failure in school, which of course leads to problems later in life. Exposing children to reading even before they can read exposes them to words and experiences they would have never received in daily life, which lays the foundation for them to be familiar with concepts they will later learn in school. Failure in school leads to social problems like delinquency, teen pregnancy, and substance abuse. Reading out loud familiarizes children with experiences they would not otherwise be exposed to, giving them knowledge before they ever enter school. It also teaches them to have a bigger vocabulary, which can help them get further in life. For example, teachers tend to pay attention to kids who have better reading comprehension than the rest of class, and often provide them with access to books at higher levels of reading, giving a child more knowledge than other students. Reading to a child provides you with an opportunity for a child to look up to you because when you are excited about reading, a child will be too. You set the example for your child to become a reader, and when they engage with reading over time, they turn to you for help. Reading out loud provides children with a world they can imagine, even when the book already contains pictures. Books give children ideas, characters, and settings outside of their experience, which they often will explore when playing “pretend.”","output":"Reading is really important for kids to learn words and how they sound. When you read out loud to little kids, it helps them learn new words and enjoy reading. Reading can also help them feel better during hard times and do better in school. When you're excited about reading, it makes kids want to read too! Reading out loud lets kids imagine new worlds and play pretend with new ideas and characters. So, reading to kids is a really good thing to do."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The marriage caused consternation from Mary , Queen of Scots , as the couple had married without having obtained royal consent .  - The Church of Scotland, known informally by its Scots language name, the Kirk, is the national church of Scotland. Protestant and Presbyterian, its longstanding decision to respect \\"liberty of opinion in points which do not enter into the substance of the Faith.\\" means it is relatively tolerant of a variety of theological positions, including those who would term themselves conservative and liberal in their doctrine, ethics and interpretation of Scripture.  - John Knox (c. 1513  24 November 1572) was a Scottish minister, theologian, and writer who was a leader of the Reformation and is considered the founder of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. He is believed to have been educated at the University of St Andrews and worked as a notary-priest. Influenced by early church reformers such as George Wishart, he joined the movement to reform the Scottish church. He was caught up in the ecclesiastical and political events that involved the murder of Cardinal Beaton in 1546 and the intervention of the regent of Scotland Mary of Guise. He was taken prisoner by French forces the following year and exiled to England on his release in 1549.  - Mary of Guise (20 November 1515  10 June 1560) was Queen of Scots from 1538 to 1542 as the second wife of King James V. She was the mother of Mary, Queen of Scots, and served as Regent of Scotland in her daughter's name from 1554 to 1560. A native of Lorraine, she was a member of the powerful House of Guise, which played a prominent role in 16th-century French politics.

In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician. It appears to me then that virtuous happiness being our lawful aim in life, that having Academic Rank and Fame the next thing to be considered (if God approve) is to seek that Decent Competency which shall make my latter days comfortable...

Sahara struggles to live a normal life while being haunted by a dark past, which becomes entwined with her present investigation and reveals a shocking twist. Plot: Sahara Connor, a woman in her mid-30s, had a promising career as a psychic, aiding the police in solving multiple cold cases. However, a traumatic event from five years ago led her to abandon her psychic profession, and she now works as a private investigator under the pseudonym \\"Private Sahara.\\" One day, she receives a mysterious letter from a man named David Mason, who reveals that his sister, Emily, had gone missing. He believes her disappearance is connected to a series of unexplained crimes plaguing the city and requests Sahara's help, due to her unique talent for uncovering hidden truths. Reluctant to use her psychic abilities, Sahara delves into the case using her skills as an investigator to examine the victims' backgrounds and find the correlation between the crimes. As she pieces together the puzzle, Sahara discovers that each victim had a history of violent behavior or criminal activity. She begins to suspect that the perpetrator is a vigilante seeking vengeance. Meanwhile, Sahara is haunted by fragments of her own past – a series of memories involving deception, betrayal, and a life-threatening event. As the investigation intensifies, these memories start to resurface more frequently, forcing Sahara to face the pain that led her to abandon her psychic abilities. In her pursuit of justice, Sahara encounters a shadowy figure at the heart of the criminal underworld. This elusive figure, known only as \\"The Oracle,\\" seems to possess psychic abilities far more potent than hers and appears to be orchestrating the entire vigilante operation.  As she confronts this enigmatic figure, Sahara discovers that they share a dark and secret connection. The Oracle is, in fact, the person who betrayed her years ago and pushed her away from her psychic career. He reveals that he framed Emily for a crime she didn't commit; this revelation forces Sahara into a moral dilemma. Torn between her desire for justice and the realization that she cannot escape her psychic nature, Sahara must decide whether to bring down The Oracle, risking Emily's life, or to use her abilities to expose the truth and save her, putting an end to the vigilantism. In the film's climax, Sahara faces The Oracle in a battle of wits and psychic power, ultimately choosing to use her abilities once again for justice. She outsmarts The Oracle and exposes the true mastermind behind the crimes, saving Emily and causing The Oracle's downfall. The film closes with Sahara embracing her psychic abilities and rediscovering her purpose in life as she continues her work as a private investigator.

Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\".   - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics.  - The Penguin Guide to Jazz is a reference work containing an encyclopedic directory of jazz recordings on CD which are currently available in Europe or the United States. The first nine editions were compiled by Richard Cook and Brian Morton, two well known chroniclers of jazz resident in the United Kingdom.  - Thelonious Sphere Monk (October 10, 1917  February 17, 1982) was an American jazz pianist and composer.

In a technical context, this can mean adapting a device for some use other than that which it was designed for, or building a device from unusual components in an ad-hoc fashion. Improvisation, within the context of performing arts, is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties, across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines.  - Ragtime  also spelled rag-time or rag time  is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.  - John William Coltrane, also known as \\"Trane\\" (September 23, 1926  July 17, 1967), was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes in jazz and was later at the forefront of free jazz. He led at least fifty recording sessions during his career, and appeared as a sideman on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk.  - Roscoe Mitchell (born August 3, 1940 in Chicago, Illinois) is an American composer, jazz instrumentalist, and educator, known for being \\"a technically superb  if idiosyncratic  saxophonist.\\" \\"The Penguin Guide to Jazz\\" described him as \\"one of the key figures\\" in avant-garde jazz; All About Jazz states that he has been \\"at the forefront of modern music\\" for the past 35 years. Critic John Pareles in \\"The New York Times\\" has mentioned that Mitchell \\"qualifies as an iconoclast.\\" In addition to his own work as a bandleader, Mitchell is known for cofounding the Art Ensemble of Chicago and the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM).  - The saxophone (also referred to as the sax) is a family of woodwind instruments. Saxophones are usually made of brass and played with a single-reed mouthpiece similar to that of the clarinet. The saxophone family was invented by the Belgian instrument maker Adolphe Sax in 1840. Adolphe Sax wanted to create a group or series of instruments that would be the most powerful and vocal of the woodwinds, and the most adaptive of the brass instruments, that would fill the vacant middle ground between the two sections. He patented the saxophone on June 28, 1846, in two groups of seven instruments each. Each series consisted of instruments of various sizes in alternating transposition. The series pitched in B and E, designed for military bands, have proved extremely popular and most saxophones encountered today are from this series. Instruments from the so-called \\"orchestral\\" series, pitched in C and F, never gained a foothold, and the B and E instruments have now replaced the C and F instruments when the saxophone is used in an orchestra.  - Muhal Richard Abrams (born September 19, 1930, in Chicago, Illinois) is an American educator, administrator, composer, arranger, clarinetist, cellist, and jazz pianist in the free jazz medium.  - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S.  - Jack DeJohnette (born August 9, 1942) is an American jazz drummer, pianist, and composer.  - Lester Bowie (October 11, 1941  November 8, 1999) was an American jazz trumpet player and composer. He was a member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and cofounded the Art Ensemble of Chicago.  - The avant-garde (from French, \\"advance guard\\" or \\"vanguard\\", literally \\"fore-guard\\") are people or works that are experimental, radical, or unorthodox, with respect to art, culture, and society. It may be characterized by nontraditional, aesthetic innovation and initial unacceptability, and it may offer a critique of the relationship between producer and consumer.  - The Moers Festival is an international jazz festival in Moers, Germany, happening yearly every Whitsun.  - The Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) is a non-profit organization, founded in Chicago, Illinois, United States, by pianist/composer Muhal Richard Abrams, pianist Jodie Christian, drummer Steve McCall, and composer Phil Cohran. Early members included Henry Threadgill, Anthony Braxton, Jack DeJohnette, Wadada Leo Smith, Leroy Jenkins, Amina Claudine Myers, Adegoke Steve Colson, Chico Freeman, George Lewis and the Art Ensemble of Chicago: Lester Bowie, Roscoe Mitchell, Joseph Jarman, Famoudou Don Moye, and Malachi Favors. The AACM is devoted \\"to nurturing, performing, and recording serious, original music,\\" according to its charter. It supports and encourages jazz performers, composers and educators. While founded in the Jazz tradition, the groups outreach and influence has, according to Larry Blumenfeld, \\"touched nearly all corners of modern music.\\"  - A trumpet is a musical instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group contains the instruments with the highest register in the brass family. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC; they began to be used as musical instruments only in the late-14th or early 15th century. Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music. They are played by blowing air through almost-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a \\"buzzing\\" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape.   - Kelan Phil Cohran (born in Oxford, Mississippi on May 8, 1927) is a jazz musician. He is known most for his trumpet contributions in the Sun Ra Arkestra in Chicago during 1959-1961 and for his involvement in the foundation of the AACM.  - New Orleans (or ) is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana. The population of the city was 343,829 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The New Orleans metropolitan area (New OrleansMetairieKenner Metropolitan Statistical Area) had a population of 1,167,764 in 2010 and was the 46th largest in the United States. The New OrleansMetairieBogalusa Combined Statistical Area, a larger trading area, had a 2010 population of 1,452,502.  - Free jazz is an approach to jazz music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s as musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down jazz convention, often by discarding fixed chord changes or tempos. Though the music of free jazz composers varied widely, a common feature was dissatisfaction with the limitations of bebop, hard bop, and modal jazz that had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Often described as avant-garde, free jazz has also been described as an attempt to return jazz to its primitive, often religious, roots and emphasis on collective improvisation.  - A rhythm section (also called a backup band) is a group of musicians within a music ensemble or band who provide the underlying rhythm and pulse of the accompaniment, providing a rhythmic reference and \\"beat\\" for the rest of the band. Many of the rhythm section instruments, such as keyboard instruments and guitars, are also used to play the chord progression upon which the song is based. The bass instrument (either double bass or electric bass, or another low-register instrument, such as synth bass, depending on the group and its style of music) plays the low-pitched bassline that supports the chord progression, typically by emphasizing the roots of the chords (and to a lesser degree the fifths and thirds of the chords).  - Joseph Jarman (born September 14, 1937 in Pine Bluff, Arkansas), is a jazz musician, composer, and Shinshu Buddhist priest. He was one of the first members of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and a member of the Art Ensemble of Chicago.  - A big band is a type of musical ensemble associated with playing jazz music and which became popular during the Swing Era from the early 1930s until the late 1940s. Big Bands evolved with the times and continue to today. A big band typically consists of approximately 12 to 25 musicians and contains saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and a rhythm section. The terms jazz band, jazz ensemble, stage band, jazz orchestra, and dance band are also used to refer to this type of ensemble. This does not, however, mean that each one of these names is technically correct for naming a \\"big band\\" specifically.  - Eric Allan Dolphy, Jr. (June 20, 1928  June 29, 1964) was an American jazz alto saxophonist, flautist, and bass clarinetist. On a few occasions, he also played the clarinet and piccolo. Dolphy was one of several multi-instrumentalists to gain prominence in the 1960s. He was one of the first important bass clarinet soloists in jazz, extended the vocabulary and boundaries of the alto saxophone, and was among the earliest significant jazz flute soloists.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Miles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926September 28, 1991) was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th century music. With his ever-changing directions in music, Davis was at the forefront of a number of major stylistic developments in jazz over his five-decade career.  - The piccolo (Italian for \\"small\\", but named \\"ottavino\\" in Italy) is a half-size flute, and a member of the woodwind family of musical instruments. The modern piccolo has most of the same fingerings as its larger sibling, the standard transverse flute, but the sound it produces is an octave higher than written. This gave rise to the name \\"ottavino\\" (Italian for \\"little octave\\"), the name by which the instrument is referred to in the scores of Italian composers. Piccolos are now only manufactured in the key of C ; however, they were once also available in D. It was for this D piccolo that John Philip Sousa wrote the famous solo in the final repeat of the closing section (trio) of his march \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\".  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Whitsun (also Whitsunday, Whit Sunday or Whit) is the name used in Britain and Ireland, and among Anglicans throughout the world, for the Christian festival of Pentecost, the seventh Sunday after Easter, which commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Christ's disciples (Acts of the Apostles chapter 2). In England it took on some characteristics of Beltane, which originated from the pagan celebration of Summer's Day, the beginning of the summer half-year, in Europe. Whitsuntide, the week following Whitsunday, was one of three vacation weeks for the medieval villein; on most manors he was free from service on the lord's demesne this week, which marked a pause in the agricultural year. Whit Monday, the day after Whitsun, remained a holiday in the UK until 1978 when the movable holiday was replaced with the fixed Spring Bank Holiday in late May. Whit was the occasion for varied forms of celebration. In the North West of England, church and chapel parades called Whit Walks still take place at this time (sometimes on Whit Friday, the Friday after Whitsun). Typically, the parades include brass bands and choirs; girls attending are dressed in white. Traditionally, Whit fairs (sometimes called Whitsun ales) took place. Other customs such as Morris dancing were associated with Whitsun, although in most cases they have been transferred to the Spring bank holiday. Whaddon, Cambridgeshire has its own Whitsun tradition of singing a unique song around the village before and on Whit Sunday itself.

The verb \\"he went\\" translates to \\"Odešel\\", used for past tense and masculine gender. 2. \\"Away on a business trip\\" can be translated as \\"na služební cestu\\". 3. The \\"... and she had his Labrador put down by the vet\\" part of the sentence requires some attention to correctly translate to Czech. In English the sentence is indirect, but Czech does not express this indirectness in similar fashion, hence the translation of this sentence part is more literal than would normally be in English. 4. \\"And she had\\" translates to \\"a ona měla\\". The verb \\"had\\" usually translates as \\"měla\\" or \\"měl\\" depending on the gender.  5. \\"His Labrador put down\\" means that the Labrador was euthanised, in Czech, this concept is expressed by the phrase \\"jeho labradora uspat\\", which literally means \\"his Labrador was put to sleep\\". 6. \\"By the vet\\" translates to \\"u veterináře\\". Justifying: The correct expression of indirect actions in different languages can be difficult as each language has developed different ways to express indirectness. Therefore, it is important to try to stick to the original meaning of the sentence as much as possible rather than trying to render the exact structure.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: It was one of the first times the horrors of World War One had emerged from the columns of the newspapers and into the homes of ordinary people. But the Germans had actually set out to bomb Liverpool, 100 miles to the northwest, according to historians. Loughborough, where 10 died and an estimated 150 were injured, is likely to have been an entirely unintended target. Historian Robert Knight said warnings were issued when the zeppelins were spotted off the east coast. A blackout was ordered in cities across England, including Leicester, but in nearby Loughborough - a town of about 20,000 people - many lights were left on. \\"Just imagine the shock and horror, the sheer surprise people must have felt, when suddenly out of the blue came this absolutely enormous zeppelin the size of two football pitches,\\" he said. \\"They must have been terrified out of their minds and very curious.\\" Rather than seeking cover, that curiosity brought people out to see the shiny, cigar-shaped airships roll in overhead. Margaret Woolley, who was 12 at the time, told the University of Leicester in the 1980s about the bomb that landed in The Rushes, near her home. \\"We rushed out on to street and everything seemed to be in confusion,\\" she said. \\"The next morning, we went out into The Rushes to see where the bomb had dropped - my goodness, it was absolute chaos. \\"All the windows broken, curtains hanging out, all the roofs off, a big hole in the road. Of course it was really very frightening.\\" Historians disagree as to whether the bombers believed they had hit the northern cities they were aiming for or whether their plans changed due to the foggy weather. Bob Stephens believes Loughborough was identified as a target as the airships travelled west. \\"I'm absolutely staggered [the pilot] didn't hit the railway installations but he knew where the factories were and the gas and electricity works and I think he was aiming for both of those,\\" he said. But Andrew McWilliam, who is part of a campaign to commemorate the raid, said that view was a \\"conspiracy theory\\". \\"They thought they'd hit Liverpool and Sheffield, in fact they'd hit Loughborough and Burton-upon-Trent,\\" he said. A performance event in Loughborough is planned for May to remember the raid, and a plaque is to be erected in The Rushes, part-funded by a Heritage Lottery grant. Another probably unintended target that night was Ilkeston, Derbyshire, where two ironworkers were killed. One victim was Walter Wilson, who was on his way home from work. \\"He ducked behind the church wall just as a bomb struck the parish room,\\" said Stephen Flinders from the town's historical society. \\"He was hit in the back by a fragment of shrapnel, conveyed to Ilkeston Hospital and died the following day. \\"Wilson's name appears on the cenotaph on Ilkeston Market Place. Despite the fact he wasn't a serviceman, he was deemed to have died through enemy action.\\" A plaque is being unveiled in the town on Monday.","output":"In WWI, a German zeppelin intended to bomb Liverpool mistakenly targeted Loughborough, killing 10 and injuring an estimated 150. Historians believe that the zeppelin was diverted due to foggy weather, and some argue that it intentionally targeted factories and electrical works in Loughborough as an alternative. Residents were caught off guard as they had not been warned of the incoming airships. The event brought the horrors of war into the homes of ordinary people for one of the first times. A performance event is planned to commemorate the raid and a plaque will be erected in Loughborough. Another unintended target that night was Ilkeston, Derbyshire, where two ironworkers were killed.

Historically attested Native American populations, such as the Sierra Miwok, Mono and Paiute, belong to the Uto-Aztecan and Utian phyla. In the mid-19th century, a band of Native Americans called the Ahwahnechee lived in Yosemite Valley. The California Gold Rush greatly increased the number of non-indigenous people in the region.  Tensions between Native Americans and white settlers escalated into the Mariposa War. As part of this conflict, settler James Savage led the Mariposa Battalion into Yosemite Valley in 1851, in pursuit of Ahwaneechees led by Chief Tenaya.  Accounts from the battalion, especially from Dr. Lafayette Bunnell, popularized Yosemite Valley as a scenic wonder. In 1864, Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoia trees were transferred from federal to state ownership. Yosemite pioneer Galen Clark became the park's first guardian. Conditions in Yosemite Valley were made more hospitable to people and access to the park was improved in the late 19th century. Naturalist John Muir and others became increasingly alarmed about the excessive exploitation of the area. Their efforts helped establish Yosemite National Park in 1890. Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were added to the national park in 1906. The United States Army had jurisdiction over the national park from 1891 to 1914, followed by a brief period of civilian stewardship. The newly formed National Park Service took over the park's administration in 1916. Improvements to the park helped to increase visitation during this time. Preservationists led by Muir and the Sierra Club failed to save Hetch Hetchy Valley from becoming a reservoir in 1923. In 1964, 89 percent of the park was set aside in a highly protected wilderness area, and other protected areas were added adjacent to the park. The once-famous Yosemite Firefall, created by pushing red hot embers off a cliff near Glacier Point at night, was discontinued in the mid-to-late 20th century along with other activities that were deemed to be inconsistent with protection of the national park.

Curiosity is set to take its first Martian drive today, mission controllers have confirmed. The Mars rover Curiosity has been investigating the Martian weather around it and the soil beneath it, as its controllers prepare for the car-size vehicle's first drive on Mars. Last night the rover wiggled its wheels to test its motor system, and Nasa was set to send the rover its first driving commands. Scroll down for video. Handling's out of this world: Nasa's Curiosity Rovers tests its steering during final checks before it sets off across the surface of Mars. 'Late tonight, we plan to send Curiosity. the commands for doing our first drive tomorrow,' Curiosity. Mission Manager Michael Watkins of JPL said last night. 'We'll. drive about three meters forward, and then turn, and then drive back a. little less than that ... We don't back up right to the same location. that we are in right now.' If. the test, set to last around 90 minutes, is a success, Curiosity will. leave its landing spot in three or four days, Mr Watkins said. If all goes to plan Curiosity will end up parked at 90 degrees to its. original touchdown position. 'We want to park in a place we've exactly. examined. 'We just want to be extra safe,' said Mr Watkins. 'We have a couple more activities to complete before we start driving,' he said. Curiosity. will first head in the direction of Glenelg, a spot in Gale Crater less. than 500 meters (yards) away from its current position. The site. contains three different kinds of terrain that NASA scientists aim to. explore. Preparing to drive: Nasa released high resolution images of the rover's extended arm as it sent the rovers commands for its first drive on the red planet. It checks air temperature,. ground temperature, air pressure, wind and other variables every hour at. the landing site in Gale Crater. On a typical Martian day, or \\"sol,\\"  based on measurements so far in the two-week old mission, air temperatures swing from 28 degrees to minus 103 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2 to minus 75 Celsius), Nasa said. Ground temperatures change even more between afternoon and pre-dawn morning, from 37 degrees to minus 132 degrees Fahrenheit (3 to minus 91 Celsius). 'We will learn about changes from day to day and season to season,' said Javier Gómez-Elvira of the Centro de Astrobiología, Madrid, Spain, principal investigator for the suite of weather sensors called the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS). Within a week or so, daily Mars weather reports from Curiosity will become available. However, the mission also hit its first problem as scientists found one of the two sets of wind sensors is not providing data. 'One possibility is that pebbles lofted during the landing hit the delicate circuit boards on one of the two REMS booms,' said Curiosity Deputy Project Scientist Ashwin Vasavada of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. Another new image of Curiosity's extended arm surveying the Martian landscape. Researchers found one of two wind sensors on it had not survived the landing, and believe it may have been broken by a pebble. 'We will have to be more clever about using the remaining wind sensor to get wind speed and direction.' An instrument provided by Russia is checking for water bound into minerals in the top three feet (one meter) of soil beneath the rover. It employs a technology that is used in oil prospecting on Earth, but had never before been sent to another planet. 'Curiosity has begun shooting neutrons into the ground,' said Igor Mitrofanov of Space Research Institute, Moscow, principal investigator for this instrument, called the Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons, or DAN. 'We measure the amount of hydrogen in the soil by observing how the neutrons are scattered, and hydrogen on Mars is an indicator of water.' The most likely hydrogen to be found in shallow ground of Gale Crater, near the Martian equator, is in hydrated minerals. These are minerals with water molecules, or related ions, bound into the crystalline structure of rocks. They can tenaciously retain water from a wetter past after all free water has gone. Images released last night show theCuriosity Rover is seen wiggling its wheels back and fourth during final checks before it sets off across the surface of Mars. Engineers at mission control have been running a series of tests before the one-ton vehicle's first drive which is expected in the next couple of days. The images were taken by one of Curiosity's navigation cameras. Curiosity, a six-wheeled. vehicle the size of a compact car, landed inside a vast, ancient impact. crater near Mars' equator on August 6 after an eight-month,. 354-million-mile voyage through space. Scroll down for video. Nasa's Curiosity rover has unfurled its robotic arm for the first time as scientists continue to tests its systems. The numbers around the edge are degrees of the compass and degrees below or above horizontal. The seven foot long robot arm contain a plethora of instruments, including:. A camera to capture images for analysis. A drill to get under the martian surface. A spectrometer to analyse samples. A scoop and mechanisms for sieving and portioning samples of powdered martian rock and soil. Earlier the Martian motor was shown. flexing its extending robotic arm for the first time. The 7-foot-long. (2.1-meter-long) arm maneuvers a turret of tools including a camera, a. drill, a spectrometer, a scoop and mechanisms for sieving and portioning. samples of powdered rock and soil. The view (above)is a mosaic of low-resolution thumbnail images returned to Earth a few hours after the activity on Mars, with higher resolution versions set to follow. Curiosity landed on Mars two weeks ago to begin a two-year mission using. 10 instruments to assess whether a carefully chosen study area inside. Gale Crater has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for. microbial life. The Mars rover Curiosity zapped its first rock on Sunday with a high-powered laser gun designed to analyze Martian mineral content, and scientists declared their target practice a success. The robotic science lab aimed its laser beam at the fist-sized stone nearby and shot the rock with 30 pulses over a 10-second period, NASA said in a statement issued from mission control at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory near Los Angeles. Each pulse delivers more than 1 million watts of energy for about five one-billionths of a second, vapourising a pinhead-sized bit of the rock to create a tiny spark, which is analyzed by a small telescope mounted on the instrument. The ionized glow, which can be. observed and recorded from up to 25 feet away, is then split into its. component wavelengths by three spectrometers that give scientists. information about the chemical makeup of the target rock. Curiosity has begun its science mission on Mars by 'zapping' a rock with its laser analysis equipment. The combined system, called the Chemistry-and-Camera instrument, or ChemCam, is capable of discerning more than 6,000 different wavelengths in the ultraviolet, infrared and visible light spectrum and is designed to take about 14,000 measurements throughout Curiosity's Mars mission. The purpose of Sunday's initial use of the laser, conducted at roughly 3 a.m. Pacific time (7.00 a.m. EDT), was as 'target practice' for the instrument. But scientists will examine the data they receive to determine composition of the rock, which they dubbed 'Coronation,' NASA said. 'We got a great spectrum of Coronation - lots of signal,' said ChemCam principal investigator Roger Wiens of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where the instrument was developed. 'After eight years of building the instrument, it's payoff time.' Curiosity's two-year mission is aimed at determining whether or not the planet most like Earth could have hosted microbial life.

The square inset is further magnified and processed to show the difference between images taken before and after the test. The rover's primary target is Mount Sharp, a towering mound of layered rock rising from the floor of Gale Crater. But mission controllers are gradually checking out Curiosity's sophisticated array of instruments before sending it on its first road trip across the Martian landscape. The 2.5 billion Curiosity project marks NASA's first astrobiology mission since the Viking probes to Mars during the 1970s and the most advanced robotic science lab sent to another world. The technique employed by ChemCam has been used to examine the composition of materials in other extreme environments, such as inside nuclear reactors and on the sea floor. Curiosity rover has also sent back its sharpest image of the 3-mile-high (5-kilometer-high) mountain, called Mount Sharp. The technology also has experimental applications in environmental monitoring and cancer detection. But Sunday's exercise, conducted during Curiosity's 13th full day on Mars, was the first use in interplanetary exploration, NASA said. Before Curiosity embarks on its 4.3-mile (7-km) trek to the foot of Mount Sharp, a journey that could take six months, mission controllers plan to send it out on a shorter jaunt to a spot 1,600 feet from its landing site.

Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The Mars rover Curiosity is a big robot, like a car, that was sent to Mars, a planet far away from Earth. Its job is to study Mars and see if it could have had tiny living things called microbes in the past. Curiosity has been checking the weather and the soil on Mars and getting ready for its first drive there. It will drive forward a little, turn, and then drive back a tiny bit. If everything goes well, Curiosity will move to a new spot to start exploring more. It has special tools like a camera, a drill, and other things to help it learn about Mars. One of the things the Mars rover did was to use a powerful laser to shoot at a rock and analyze what the rock is made of.

John Vass, appointed head gardener in 1939, left in 1957. Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a \\"Mecca\\" and a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators.

Write an article based on this \\"The owner of a private Tunisian TV station has been fined for showing a controversial animated film.\\"","output":"Title: A TV Station Owner in Tunisia Gets Fined for Showing a Tricky Cartoon Movie Hello little friends! Today, we are going to tell you an interesting story about a man who owns a TV station in a faraway country called Tunisia. This man got into a little bit of trouble because he showed a movie on his TV channel that some people thought was not okay. First, let's find out where Tunisia is. Tunisia is a small country in North Africa, near the big blue sea called the Mediterranean Sea. They have their own language, which is called Arabic, and people in Tunisia enjoy watching TV like we do here. Now, we must understand what a private TV station is. You see, some places have TV channels that are owned and run by the government, while others are owned by regular people or companies. This story is about a TV station that is owned by someone who is not a part of the government. One day, the man who owns this private TV station decides to show an animated film, or if you'd like to think of it, a cartoon movie. However, this cartoon movie was not like the ones we watch on Saturday mornings. Instead, some people in Tunisia believed that it had things in it that were not good for kids or grownups to see. These things, they said, were against the values and rules of the people living in Tunisia. When these people found out about the cartoon movie being shown on the TV station, they were very upset, and they told the government about it. The government looked into the matter and decided that the owner of the TV station had broken some rules by showing that movie. Because of that, the government told the TV station owner that he had to pay some money for the mistake he made. This is called a fine. It's like when you do something wrong and your parents ask you to apologize or do extra chores to make up for it. In the end, the TV station owner learned his lesson: he had to be more careful about the movies he chooses to show on his TV channel, so that everyone watching at home can enjoy fun, friendly, and respectful programs! And that's the story, little friends. We learned about a faraway country called Tunisia and how the owner of a TV station got fined for showing a controversial cartoon movie. So remember, it's always important to show respect towards the values and rules that people follow, no matter where they live."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Formed in 1982 as Hellhammer, the band became Celtic Frost in 1984 and was active until 1993. It re-formed in 2001 and disbanded following frontman Tom Gabriel Fischer's departure in 2008. Celtic Frost's frontman, guitarist and singer Tom Gabriel Fischer, adopted the alias Tom Warrior. With Steve Warrior on bass, he formed one of the earliest extreme metal bands, Hellhammer, in 1981. Steve Warrior was later replaced by Martin Eric Ain - also a pseudonym. The band attracted a small international fan-base, got signed to Noise Records in Germany and recorded their debut EP Apocalyptic Raids in March 1984, now a rare find on eBay or second-hand record stores around the world.  Metal publications were also skeptical of Hellhammer's musical endeavor. Metal Forces loathed the group; that started a long-lasting feud between that zine and Warrior, which kept Celtic Frost from playing in England for a couple of years. Rock Power was not fond of Hellhammer either - they considered it \\"the most terrible, abhorrent, and atrocious thing 'musicians' were ever allowed to record\\". In fact, they were \\"receiving miserable reviews everywhere\\", Warrior concluded.  Regarding the controversial status of his former band, Thomas said:  Way back in 1984 and 85, when Martin Eric Ain and I recorded Celtic Frost's first two albums Morbid Tales and To Mega Therion, Hellhammer lasted on us almost like a curse. Even though Hellhammer was the very reason we had thought over our goals and conceived the Frost, HH's left-overs kept being mighty rocks in our way. Many voices saw Frost as the same band with just a name-change. The lack of musical quality in HH made it almost impossible for us to get an unbiased reaction for Frost. To make a long story short, it almost killed all our work and dreams.  By May 1984, Hellhammer had disbanded. Fischer and Ain, along with session drummer Stephen Priestly, regrouped as Celtic Frost. Their 1984 debut mini-LP, Morbid Tales was a hit in the underground metal scene, and the band set out on its first tour, through Germany and Austria. This was followed with an EP Emperor's Return. Both early releases are now available on the one CD. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What instrument did Steve Warrior play?","output":"Steve Warrior played bass in Hellhammer, the earliest extreme metal band, which later transformed into Celtic Frost."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"First question: What would have happened if Germany had won WWII? It is vital to note that any discussion about such an alternate history is purely speculative in nature. However, if Nazi Germany had emerged victorious in World War II, the consequences would have been profound and far-reaching. Several possible outcomes can be hypothesized: 1. Europe and Beyond: Nazi Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, was driven by the goal of establishing a racially pure, unified Greater German Reich. If Germany had won, they would have turned most of Europe into their subjugate and there would be massive forced deportations, exterminations or enslavement of people they deemed as racially \\"undesirable\\". The Holocaust, which led to the extermination of millions of Jews, would have continued unchecked, and its scope likely broadened to include Romani people, Slavs, and other marginalized populations. A brutal fascist regime would rule Europe under the iron grip of the Nazi Party. 2. Economic Impact: A victorious Germany would have aggressively plundered the resources and wealth of European countries, leading to potentially devastating economic consequences for much of the continent. Enslaving conquered populations would create a forced labor force that would contribute to rebuilding the German military and infrastructure. 3. Geopolitical Consequences: The Soviet Union and communism would likely have been defeated and disintegrated under a German conquest. As a result, the Cold War may not have taken place in the same way, or at all, in the absence of a strong communist presence. The United States would have emerged from WWII as the primary power balancing against Nazi Germany, and the global power structure would be completely different from the one we know today. 4. Science, technology, and culture: Nazi Germany placed a strong emphasis on technological advancements, especially in the military field. In a victorious scenario, the German war machine would have likely continued to innovate, with potential advancements in jet engines, rocketry, and perhaps even nuclear weapons. Cultural outputs, including art, literature, and cinema, would have been tightly controlled and censored by the Nazi regime, potentially stifling creativity and free expression across a vast portion of the world. Second question: Why did Germany lose WWII? There are multiple reasons why Germany ultimately lost World War II: 1. Strategic Errors: Adolf Hitler made several strategic errors, such as invading the Soviet Union in 1941. The invasion, Operation Barbarossa, led to a prolonged and costly war on the Eastern Front that severely depleted Germany's military and economic resources. 2. War on Multiple Fronts: Germany had to fight against the Allied forces on multiple fronts, stretching its resources thin. After the United States entered the war in December 1941, Germany had to confront the combined efforts of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, which ultimately overwhelmed German forces. 3. Economic Limitations: Although Germany had a strong and advanced military, it did not have the economic resources to match the United States and other Allied powers. The expansion of the war across multiple fronts and the need to maintain a vast army, navy, and air force drained the German economy, and by 1944, the Third Reich was in an economically precarious position. 4. Increased Allied Cooperation: The Allies worked closely together and coordinated their efforts against Germany in the latter stages of the war. This united front allowed them to effectively push the Germans back on both Eastern and Western fronts. 5. Technological Superiority: The Allied powers, particularly the United States, began to surpass Germany in terms of technological advancements. This proved decisive during the later stages of the war, especially in the air and naval battles. In conclusion, while these two questions are related, they are not asking precisely the same thing. The first question deals with a speculative alternate history in which Germany emerged victorious in WWII, and the potential consequences of that victory. The second question examines the real-world reasons why Germany lost WWII and the Allied powers triumphed. The connection between the two questions lies in their exploration of how Germany's victory or defeat shaped the world at large and the course of history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Take 2 plastic connectors with a  3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) diameter and align the threaded side with the opening of the ball valve. Attach a connector to each side of the ball valve by turning them clockwise until they’re tight. You won’t be able to screw the connector all the way in, so make sure it’s tight and securely connected. Take another hose clamp and fit it onto the other end of the tubing so it will be in place to clamp over the connector. Leave it on the tubing so you can move it into place when you attach the valve. Let the hose clamp hang loosely on the tubing so you can move it into position after you attach the funnel to the valve.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the persont that painted Charles IV of Spain and His Family? , can you please find it?   In 1692, the Neapolitan painter Luca Giordano  became one of the few allowed to view paintings held in Philip IV's private apartments, and was greatly impressed by Las Meninas. Giordano described the work as the \\"theology of painting\\", and was inspired to paint A Homage to Velázquez (National Gallery, London). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of Italian art was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as Las Meninas.An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Mazo of subjects depicted in Las Meninas, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink.  Mazo's painting of The Family of the Artist also shows a composition similar to that of Las Meninas. Francisco Goya etched a print of Las Meninas in 1778, and later used Velázquez's painting as the model for his Charles IV of Spain and His Family. As in Las Meninas, the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. Goya, however, replaces the atmospheric and warm perspective of Las Meninas with what Pierre Gassier calls a sense of \\"imminent suffocation\\". Goya's royal family is presented on a \\"stage facing the public, while in the shadow of the wings the painter, with a grim...

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. While not as famous as some of their other collaborations (such as THE BLACK CAT and THE BODY SNATCHER), this is a dandy little horror film even though the casting decisions were a bit odd. Boris Karloff plays Dr. Janos Rukh, a weird scientist who lives in the Carpathian mountains--near where the Dracula character's home town. Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Benet--whose nationality was never discussed though the name certainly sounds French. I really think it would have made sense to have the two switch roles, as the Carpathian role seems tailor made for Lugosi--especially with his accent. However, despite this unusual twist, the two still did excellent jobs. Karloff's was definitely the lead role, but Lugosi acquitted himself well as a relatively normal person--something he didn't play very often in films!! It seems that Dr. Rukh is a bit of a pariah, as other scientists (especially Benet) think his theories are bizarre and nonsensical. However, over the course of the film, Rukh turns out to be right and Benet is especially generous in his new praise for Rukh. But, unfortunately, the wonderful new element that Rukh discovered has the nasty side effect of turning him into a crazy killing machine (don't you hate it when that happens?). While this could have just been a simple nice scientist turned mad story, the plot was well constructed, the characters nicely developed and the mad Rukh was NOT a one-dimensional killer, but complex and interesting. This film is bound to be enjoyed by anyone except for people who hate old horror films. You can really tell that Universal Pictures pulled out all the stops and made a bigger-budget film instead of the cheap quickies both Lugosi and Karloff unfortunately gravitated in later years. Good stuff. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"This review thought positively of the movie. The reviewer praised the performances of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, appreciated the well-constructed plot and character development, and noted that the film was a higher-budget production compared to some of their later works.

Information:  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - The Tharsis Montes are three large shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. From north to south, the volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons. Mons (plural \\"montes\\") is the Latin word for mountain. It is a descriptor term used in astrogeology for mountainous features in the Solar System.  - Biblis Tholus is an extinct Martian volcano located at 2.55 ° N 235.62 ° E , one of two volcanoes near the center of the Tharsis volcanism . Along with Ulysses Tholus , it is almost midway between Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes . It is approximately 170 kilometers ( 110 mi ) long and 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) wide , rising about 3 kilometers ( 1.9 mi ) from its surroundings . In the middle of the volcano is a caldera , named Biblis Patera , believed to have formed as the result of collapse of the magma chamber during eruptions of the volcano . The caldera is 53 kilometers ( 33 mi ) in diameter and four kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) in depth .  - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.  - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from .   - Mount Everest, also known in Nepal as Sagarmth and in China as Chomolungma/, is earth's highest mountain. Its peak is above sea level. Mount Everest is in the Mahalangur Range. The international border between China (Tibet Autonomous Region) and Nepal runs across Everest's summit point. Its massif includes neighbouring peaks Lhotse, ; Nuptse, , and Changtse, .  - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.  - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers.  Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground.  - The Tharsis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Tharsis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-9 (Mars Chart-9).  - Ascraeus Mons is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the northernmost and tallest of three shield volcanoes collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The volcano's location corresponds to the classical albedo feature Ascraeus Lacus.  - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.  - Olympus Mons (Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. By one measure, it has a height of nearly 22 km (13.6 mi). Olympus Mons stands about two and a half times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level. It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period. It is currently the largest volcano discovered in the Solar System and had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for \\"Olympic Snow\\"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain.  - A space probe is a robotic spacecraft that leaves Earth orbit and explores space. It may approach the Moon; enter interplanetary space; flyby, orbit, or land on other planetary bodies; or approach interstellar space.  - Magma (from Ancient Greek  (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock.  - Pavonis Mons (Latin for \\"peacock mountain\\") is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the middle member of a chain of three volcanic mountains (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes) that straddle the Martian equator between longitudes 235°E and 259°E. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971 and was originally called Middle Spot. Its name formally became Pavonis Mons in 1973.  - Ulysses Tholus is a Martian volcano. It is located in the Tharsis quadrangle at 2.89° north latitude and 121.55° west longitude. It is 58 km across and is named after a classical albedo feature name. Ulysses Tholus is immediately east and slightly north of another volcano, Biblis Tholus.   - Mount Olympus (also transliterated as Olympos, and on Greek maps, Oros Olympos) is the highest mountain in Greece and the second highest mountain in the Balkans. It is located in the Olympus Range on the border between Thessaly and Macedonia, between the regional units of Pieria and Larissa, about southwest from Thessaloniki. Mount Olympus has 52 peaks, deep gorges, and exceptional biodiversity. The highest peak \\"Mytikas\\", meaning \\"nose\\", rises to . It is one of the highest peaks in Europe in terms of topographic prominence.  - Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world.  - Arsia Mons is the southernmost of three volcanos (collectively known as Tharsis Montes) on the Tharsis bulge near the equator of the planet Mars. To its north is Pavonis Mons, and north of that is Ascraeus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is to its northwest. Its name comes from a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which he named in turn after the legendary Roman forest of Arsia Silva.  - Tarshish occurs in the Hebrew Bible with several uncertain meanings, most frequently as a place (probably a large city or region) far across the sea from the Land of Israel and Phoenicia. Tarshish was said to have supplied vast quantities of important metals to Israel and Phoenicia. The same place-name occurs in the Akkadian inscriptions of Esarhaddon (the Assyrian king, d. 669 BC) and also on the Phoenician inscription on the Nora Stone, indicating that it was a \\"real\\" place; its precise location was never commonly known, and was eventually lost in antiquity. Legends grew up around it over time so that its identity has been the subject of scholarly research and commentary for more than two thousand years. Its importance stems in part from the fact that Hebrew biblical passages tend to understand Tarshish as a source of King Solomon's great wealth in metals - especially silver, but also gold, tin and iron (Ezekiel 27). The metals were reportedly obtained in partnership with King Hiram of Phoenician Tyre (Isaiah 23), and the fleets of Tarshish-ships. However, Solomon's Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians, thus archaeological evidence has been difficult to uncover.

Through the centuries, the cathedral has undergone various restoration projects due to different reasons, such as damage inflicted during the English Civil War in the 17th century, or to maintain and enhance the structure and its intricate features. The position of the bishop evolved and changed over time as well, with Michael Ipgrave being the 99th and current Bishop of Lichfield. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Lichfield Cathedral was founded by the Bishop in 2016\\" does not accurately follow the information provided in the preceding text. The cathedral was constructed in the medieval period, and the date 2016 only refers to the appointment of the current bishop."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\" are completely different?, using the article: Soon after composing \\"Halo\\", Tedder worked with Kelly Clarkson on her fourth studio album, All I Ever Wanted (2009), for which they wrote \\"Already Gone\\" together. When the song came out, critics noted a resemblance to Beyoncé's \\"Halo\\". Clarkson, however, initially stated that she was unaware of any similarities between the two songs. She eventually realized their resemblance when she listened to both recordings closely; the similarities are most notable in the backing tracks, which in both cases feature a melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps. Clarkson tried to prevent \\"Already Gone\\" from being included on All I Ever Wanted, but it was impossible to make last minute changes, as her album was already being printed when I Am... Sasha Fierce was released. She accused Tedder of using the same arrangement on both \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\", and complained that people would, incorrectly, assume she was stealing it from Beyoncé.Clarkson was furious, and confronted Tedder on the phone. In response, Tedder commented that he would never give two artists the same musical arrangement, and that her criticism was \\"hurtful and absurd\\". He asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\" are completely different. Calling \\"Already Gone\\" one of the best songs he had ever composed, Tedder challenged people to \\"listen [to the two ballads] and form their own opinions\\". Clarkson also tried to stop her label, RCA, from releasing \\"Already Gone\\" as a single because she respected Beyoncé, but they went against her will and released it. She said, \\"It's one of those things I have no control over. I already made my album. At this point, the record company can do whatever they want with it.\\" Clarkson later told James Montgomery of MTV News that it was unfortunate \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\" sound so similar, but noted that at least they have different vocal melodies., what would be the answer ?","output":"The name of the person who asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of \\"Already Gone\\" and \\"Halo\\" are completely different is Ryan Tedder, the composer and songwriter involved in the creation of both songs.

The Pacific ocean has less phytoplankton and nutrients for marine life.  Which ocean experiences a stronger coastal upwelling?  Hint: Among the tropical oceans, the western Indian Ocean hosts one of the largest concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer, due to the strong monsoon winds. The monsoonal wind forcing leads to a strong coastal and open ocean upwelling, which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. These phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem, as the base of the marine food web, and eventually the larger fish species. The Indian Ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna.Research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the marine ecosystem. A study on the phytoplankton changes in the Indian Ocean indicates a decline of up to 20% in the marine phytoplankton in the Indian Ocean, during the past six decades. The tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.Endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales.An Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010 covering at least 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles). Riding the southern Indian Ocean Gyre, this vortex of plastic garbage constantly circulates the ocean from Australia to Africa, down the Mozambique Channel, and back to Australia in a period of six years, except for debris that get indefinitely stuck in the centre of the gyre.The garbage patch in the Indian Ocean will, according to a 2012 study, decrease in size after several decades to vanish completely over centuries.  Over several millennia, however, the global system of garbage patches will accumulate in the North Pacific.In 2016 six new animal... A:","output":"The Indian Ocean experiences a stronger coastal upwelling due to the strong monsoon winds that lead to coastal and open ocean upwelling, which introduces nutrients into the upper zones for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production.

Fact 2: Sunlight is composed of photons, or particles of solar energy.  Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What does a plant need in order to grow?\\" with the following options:  - body water  - rocks  - wind  - nutrients  - photons  - sugar  - sound waves  - cells Answer:","output":"In order to grow, plants require primarily sunlight, water, nutrients, and cells. These are not the only requirements but they are the primary ones.  From the options given, photons and nutrients are directly relevant. This is because photons, which make up sunlight, are absorbed by the plant for the process of photosynthesis. The process of photosynthesis is vital for plant growth as it allows plants to convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy that can be later used to fuel the plant's activities. As per Fact 1 provided, a plant requires sunlight to grow, and according to Fact 2, sunlight is composed of photons. Therefore, the photons are playing a key role for plants growth. Nutrients are also essential for plant growth. They absorb these from the soil through their roots. These nutrients, like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, are important because they contribute to different aspects of the plant's growth and health. For instance, nitrogen is central to the creation of protein essential for new tissues. Phosphorous plays a key role in the process of photosynthesis, nutrient transportation, and energy transfer. Potassium promotes overall plant vigor. Apart from sunlight (photons) and nutrients, plants also need water which comprise a major part of a plant's body and are involved in almost every function of its growth and development. While it's not directly mentioned in this list as \\"body water\\", water is absolutely critical for a plant's growth.  Cells are also essential. Plant cells have unique features that distinguishes them from animals cells, such as a cell wall and chloroplasts, which are involved in photosynthesis. Plant cells divide and differentiate to allow for growth in size and complexity in different parts of the plant. While elements like rocks and wind can indirectly influence a plant's growth by affecting factors like soil quality and pollination, they are not direct growth requirements. Sugar, produced by the plant itself through photosynthesis, is a source of energy that contributes to the growth of the plant. Sound waves do not significantly contribute to plant growth under normal circumstances.  To summarize, the answer to \\"What does a plant need in order to grow?\\" from the given options would be photons (from sunlight), nutrients, and cells. Even not listed in the options, water is also a primary essential factor needed by plants for their growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the best known non-vocal piece by Massenet?, using the article: Massenet was a fluent and skilful orchestrator, and willingly provided ballet episodes for his operas, incidental music for plays, and a one-act stand-alone ballet for Vienna (Le carillon, 1892). Macdonald remarks that Massenet's orchestral style resembled that of Delibes, \\"with its graceful movement and bewitching colour\\", which was highly suited to classical French ballet. The Méditation for solo violin and orchestra, from Thaïs, is possibly the best known non-vocal piece by Massenet, and appears on many recordings. Another popular stand-alone orchestral piece from the operas is Le dernier sommeil de la Vierge from La Vierge, which has featured on numerous discs since the middle of the 20th century.A Parisian critic, after seeing La grand' tante, declared that Massenet was a symphonist rather than a theatre composer. At the time of the British premiere of Manon in 1885, the critic in The Manchester Guardian, reviewing the work enthusiastically, nevertheless echoed his French confrère's view that the composer was really a symphonist, whose music was at its best when purely orchestral.  Massenet took a wholly opposite view of his talents. He was temperamentally unsuited to writing symphonically: the constraints of sonata form bored him. He wrote, in the early 1870s, \\"What I have to say, musically, I have to say rapidly, forcefully, concisely; my discourse is tight and nervous, and if I wanted to express myself otherwise I would not be myself.\\" His efforts in the concertante field made little mark, but his orchestral suites, colourful and picturesque according to Grove, have survived on the fringes of the repertoire.  Other works for orchestra are a symphonic poem, Visions (1891), an Ouverture de Concert (1863) and Ouverture de Phèdre (1873). After early attempts at chamber music as a student, he wrote little more in the genre. Most of his early chamber pieces are now lost; three pieces for cello and piano survive., what would be the answer ?

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  Manchester  for the following movie plot:  This article needs an improved plot summary. (November 2015) Eric Bishop is a football fanatic postman whose life is descending into crisis. Looking after his granddaughter is bringing him into contact with his ex-wife, Lily, whom he abandoned after the birth of their daughter. At the same time, his stepson Ryan is hiding a gun under the floorboards of his bedroom for a violent drugs baron. At his lowest moments Bishop considers suicide. But after a short meditation session with fellow postmen in his living room, and smoking cannabis stolen from his stepson, hallucinations bring forth his footballing hero, the famously philosophical Eric Cantona, who gives him advice. His relationship with Lily improves dramatically. Bishop finds the gun and confronts his stepson. Ryan admits to his involvement with the drugs gang, and Bishop attempts to return the gun to the gangster. He is forced to keep it himself, however, when a Rottweiler is set on him in his car. The gangster then posts footage on YouTube of Bishop's humiliation. The entire family is then arrested by the police on a tip-off but they fail to find the gun as it is hidden in the fridge, under a chicken. Eric Cantona then advises Bishop to seek help from his friends and to 'surprise' himself. Bishop organises 'Operation Cantona', sneaking dozens of fellow Manchester United fans â wearing Cantona masks â into the gangster's house and humiliating him and his family, threatening to put the video of their operation onto YouTube, in turn.

Solve -68 + 24 = -22*k for k.","output":"To solve the equation -68 + 24 = -22 * k for k, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation. First, simplify the left side of the equation by adding -68 and 24. -68 + 24 = -44 So, the simplified equation becomes: -44 = -22 * k Step 2: Isolate the variable k. To find the value of k, we need to isolate it by getting rid of the coefficient -22. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -22. -44 / -22 = (-22 * k) / -22 Step 3: Solve for k. Divide -44 by -22. -44 / -22 = 2 So, the value of k is: k = 2 Step 4: Verify the solution. To check if our solution is correct, we can substitute the value of k back into the original equation. -68 + 24 = -22 * k -68 + 24 = -22 * 2 -44 = -44 The original equation is true, which confirms that our solution is correct: k = 2"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  After Shackleton left with the James Caird, Frank Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: Lewis Rickinson had suffered a suspected heart attack; Perce Blackborow was unable to walk, due to frostbitten feet; Hubert Hudson was depressed. The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of George Marston and Lionel Greenstreet, a hut—nicknamed the \\"Snuggery\\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.Wild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.As the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.By 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed. The surrounding sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship,...  answer the following question:  What is the first name of the person who established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium?

This means the dog generates less heat through the (A) tall grass or (B) short grass  Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"short grass\\" and  \\"tall grass\\".","output":"The dog generates less heat when running through short grass. The reason behind this lies in the factors that affect heat generation in a dog when running through grass of different heights. First, let's understand the association between speed, friction and heat production. When a dog runs through short grass, it can maintain a faster pace as there is a reduced resistance. The blades of grass offer comparatively less friction against the dog's body, specifically its legs and underbelly, as it moves through the short grass. Less friction equals less energy expenditure, which consequently results in a reduced amount of heat generated by the dog's muscles. On the other hand, when a dog runs through tall grass, it faces increased resistance due to the height and density of the blades of grass, which disrupt its movement. Consequently, the dog experiences a higher amount of friction as it constantly pushes against the grass, forcing it to use more energy to maintain its pace. In this scenario, the dog's muscles will work harder to overcome the resistance, and as a result, the dog generates more heat. Additionally, the dog's body posture in both cases can also indicate the heat generation. In short grass, the dog can maintain an efficient and natural posture, with proper distribution of force and muscle work. However, in tall grass, the dog might adapt an unnatural posture and gait to navigate through the grass, causing it to use its muscles inefficiently and generate more heat. Taking all these factors into account, it is evident that a dog generates less heat when running through short grass than it does when running through tall grass."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Betty needed to get measured for a new bra and Angela said she could help.","output":"Betty and Angela made plans to meet at the local department store, where they knew there was a reliable and experienced bra-fitting specialist. Step 1: The first step is to meet up at the department store. It is always better to get measured in person and have a professional fitting to ensure the correct size and shape for the best support and comfort. As Betty strolled through the store, she spotted Angela in the lingerie section, already browsing through various styles of bras. The two friends exchanged greetings and decided to look for the expert. Step 2: Ask a store employee for assistance. A store employee can direct them to the bra-fitting specialist, saving them time. Angela confidently approached a sales associate and inquired about the bra-fitting specialist. The employee happily led them to a small, private room, where the fitting specialist, Susan, awaited them. Step 3: Listen to the expert's advice. The professional bra fitter would determine the perfect bra size and offer recommendations on the best styles for Betty's body shape. Susan greeted them warmly and began to explain the process of measuring for a new bra. With her tape measure in hand, she accurately measured Betty's bust and underbust, ensuring that the measurements were correct. Susan mentioned that it was common for women to wear the wrong size bra and how important it was to re-measure from time to time. Step 4: Try on different styles of bras. It is essential to try on various bras to figure out which ones offer the best support, comfort, and aesthetic for the person. Once Susan determined Betty's correct size, she brought in an assortment of bras for her to try. Throughout the fitting, Susan guided Betty on how to adjust the straps and position the cups correctly so that each bra provided optimal support. Step 5: Make a decision and shop for bras. After trying on several options and considering the expert's suggestions, it's time to choose which bras are best tailored to Betty's needs. Angela, who was patiently waiting outside the fitting room, joined Betty in selecting the most comfortable and supportive bras that would suit her daily wear and specific occasions according to her preferences. Together, they picked out a few practical bras that were both stylish and offered the right level of support. Step 6: Thank the specialist and spend time with friends. To wrap up the day, express gratitude to the expert for the help offered and use the opportunity to bond with friends over the shopping experience. Once they made their purchases, Betty and Angela thanked Susan for her expertise and assistance. They decided to celebrate Betty's newfound comfort and support by grabbing a coffee at a nearby cafe, chatting about their experience and catching up on each other's lives.

Given the question: Information:  - Somalia ( '), officially the Federal Republic of Somalia , is a country located in the Horn of Africa. It is bordered by Ethiopia to the west, Djibouti to the northwest, the Gulf of Aden to the north, the Indian Ocean to the east, and Kenya to the southwest. Somalia has the longest coastline on Africa's mainland, and its terrain consists mainly of plateaus, plains and highlands. Climatically, hot conditions prevail year-round, with periodic monsoon winds and irregular rainfall.  - Aden (, ; \\"\\" ) is a port city in Yemen, located by the eastern approach to the Red Sea (the Gulf of Aden), some east of Bab-el-Mandeb. Its population is approximately 800,000 people. Aden's ancient, natural harbour lies in the crater of a dormant volcano which now forms a peninsula, joined to the mainland by a low isthmus. This harbour, Front Bay, was first used by the ancient Kingdom of Awsan between the 5th and 7th centuries BC. The modern harbour is on the other side of the peninsula. Aden gives its name to the Gulf of Aden.  - Swayne 's hartebeest ( Alcelaphus buselaphus swaynei ) is an endangered antelope native to Ethiopia . Two of the largest remaining populations are located in Senkelle Swayne 's Hartebeest Sanctuary and Maze National Park . It has been extirpated from Somalia . It is named after British officer H. G. C. Swayne ( 1860 -- 1940 ) .  - Bison are large, even-toed ungulates in the genus \\"Bison\\" within the subfamily Bovinae.  - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla.  - Ethiopia ('), officially known as the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia\\"' (   , \\"yetiyoya Fdralaw Dmokirasyaw Rpebilk\\" ), is a country located in the Horn of Africa. It shares borders with Eritrea to the north and northeast, Djibouti and Somalia to the east, Sudan and South Sudan to the west, and Kenya to the south. With nearly 100 million inhabitants, Ethiopia is the most populous landlocked country in the world, as well as the second-most populous nation on the African continent after Nigeria. It occupies a total area of , and its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa.  - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - The domestic goat (\\"Capra aegagrus hircus\\") is a subspecies of goat domesticated from the wild goat of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe.  - An antelope is a member of a number of even-toed ungulate species indigenous to various regions in Africa and Eurasia. Antelopes comprise a wastebasket taxon (miscellaneous group) within the family Bovidae, encompassing those Old World species that are not cattle, sheep, buffalo, bison, or goats. A group of antelope is called a herd.  - The sheep (\\"Ovis aries\\") is a quadrupedal, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name \\"sheep\\" applies to many species in the genus \\"Ovis\\", in everyday usage it almost always refers to \\"Ovis aries\\". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a \\"ewe\\", an intact male as a \\"ram\\" or occasionally a \\"tup\\", a castrated male as a \\"wether\\", and a younger sheep as a \\"lamb\\".  - A herd is a social grouping of certain animals of the same species, either wild or domestic.

After moving to Havana in the sixties to continue his studies, Reinaldo begins to explore his ambitions, as well as his sexuality. After receiving an honorary mention in a writing contest, Arenas is offered the chance to publish his first work. Through his work and friendships with other openly gay men (such as Pepe Malas and Tomas Diego), Arenas manages to find himself. The political climate in Cuba becomes increasingly dangerous, and in the early seventies Arenas is arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting minors, and for publishing abroad without official consent. In the next decade, Arenas is in and out of prison, attempting and failing to leave the country several times. In 1980, Arenas finally leaves Cuba for the US, starting a new life with his close friend Lazaro Gomez Carriles.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Questions 1 and 2 are indeed asking the same thing but in slightly different ways. Both questions are seeking information about countries' flags that have interesting stories or histories behind them. To provide a comprehensive answer to both questions, I will detail a few examples of countries with intriguing stories behind their flags. 1. United States of America - The Stars and Stripes The flag of the United States, commonly known as the Stars and Stripes, has 13 horizontal red and white stripes, representing the 13 original colonies. The blue rectangle in the canton holds 50 white, five-pointed stars, representing the current 50 US states. The legend of Betsy Ross creating the first American flag is widely known; however, it is disputed among historians. The design now attributed to Ross, chosen in 1777, has gone through 27 different versions as new states joined the Union. The current version was adopted on July 4, 1960, after Hawaii became the 50th state. 2. Brazil - The Yellow Diamond and Blue Circle The flag of Brazil features a green field with a large yellow diamond in the center, inside of which is a blue circle with 27 white, five-pointed stars arranged in the shape of the night sky as it appeared over Rio de Janeiro on November 15, 1889. The stars represent the 26 Brazilian states and the Federal District. The flag's green and yellow colors represent the House of Braganza and the House of Habsburg, the two royal houses of Pedro I and his wife Maria Leopoldina, who declared Brazil's independence from Portugal. 3. South Africa - The Multicolored Flag The South African flag is a vibrant and unique design, representing the diverse nature of the nation. Adopted in 1994, following the end of apartheid, the flag's six colors symbolize unity and progress. The Y-shaped design combines the red, white, and blue colors of the Dutch and British flags (acknowledging their part in South African history) with the green, black, and gold of the African National Congress, which played a significant role in ending apartheid. The flag thus celebrates the convergence of multiple cultural, historical, and political influences. 4. United Kingdom - The Union Jack The Union Jack is a combination of three different flags: England's St. George's Cross (red cross on a white field), Scotland's St. Andrew's Cross (white diagonal cross on a blue field), and Ireland's St. Patrick's Cross (red diagonal cross on a white field). The flag represents the unity of these three countries under the United Kingdom. However, the Welsh flag is notably absent from the design as, by the time the Union Jack was created, Wales had already been annexed by England and was thereby represented by the St. George's Cross. Due to this complex history, the Union Jack is an excellent example of a flag with a compelling backstory. These are just a few examples of countries with interesting stories behind their flags. There are countless other flags with fascinating histories reflecting each nation's unique cultural, political, and historical influences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Streets of Fire Movie plot: In an unnamed city in a time period that resembles the 1950s (referred to within the film as 'another time, another place'), Ellen Aim (Diane Lane), lead singer of Ellen Aim and The Attackers, has returned home to give a concert. The Bombers, a biker gang, led by Raven Shaddock (Willem Dafoe), kidnap Ellen. Witnessing this is Reva Cody (Deborah Van Valkenburgh), who hires her brother Tom (Michael ParÃ©), an ex-soldier and Ellen's ex-boyfriend, to rescue her. Tom returns and checks out the local tavern, the Blackhawk. He is annoyed by a tomboyish ex-soldier named McCoy (Amy Madigan), a mechanic who \\"could drive anything\\" and who is good with her fists. They leave the bar and later Tom hires McCoy to be his driver. That night, Tom and Reva plan to rescue Ellen; Reva contacts Billy Fish (Rick Moranis), Ellen's manager and current boyfriend. While Reva and McCoy go to a diner to wait for Billy, Tom acquires a cache of weapons, including a pump action shotgun, a revolver, and a lever action rifle. Tom and Billy meet at the diner and Tom agrees to the rescue for 10,000, and that Billy goes with Tom back into \\"the Battery\\" to get Ellen. In the Battery, they visit Torchie's, where Billy used to book bands. They wait until nightfall under an overpass, watching bikers come and go. Raven has Ellen tied up in an upstairs bedroom. As Tom, Billy, and McCoy approach, Tom directs Billy to get the car and be out front in fifteen minutes. McCoy enters and is stopped by one of the \\"Bombers\\". McCoy, pretending to like him, follows him to his special \\"party room,\\" close to where Raven is playing poker. McCoy knocks him out. Tom finds a window and, as a distraction, starts shooting the gas tanks on the gang's motorcycles; he then reaches Ellen's room, cuts her free and, with McCoy's help, escapes just as Billy arrives at the front door.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Joel has just started his first day working as a scientist in a laboratory. The first task he was given is to look at two atoms and to jot down as much information about the two as he can. First, he needs to come up with an identification for these atoms. Since he is new, he decides to keep it professional and simply call the larger of the two atoms \\"atom L\\" and the smaller one \\"atom S\\". Now that he's taken care of that he can get down to work.  and a hint : The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. This is particularly easy to see in the alkali metals, where the single valence electron is shielded by all of the inner core electrons.  Please answer this question : Is the shielding effect in atom S higher or lower than in atom L? Answer:","output":"The shielding effect in atom S is higher than in atom L. To understand why, let us first briefly discuss what the shielding effect is and how it relates to the overall atomic structure. The shielding effect refers to the phenomenon where the attraction between an electron and the nucleus is partially \\"shielded\\" or weakened due to the presence of other electrons, particularly those in the inner electron shells. These inner electrons essentially block some of the attractive force from the nucleus, making it more challenging to remove an electron in the outer shells. This effect has strong implications on ionization energies, which represent the energy required to remove an electron from an atom. Now, let's go back to the hint given. It discusses ionization energies of representative elements in a group of elements, stating that the ionization energies generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. The reason behind this decrease in ionization energy is due to the increasing atomic size as well as the increasing shielding effect for larger atoms within the group. When comparing atom L and atom S, atom L is larger than atom S. As a result, the valence electrons in atom L are further from the nucleus, and the shielding effect increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. The increased shielding effect in atom L subsequently weakens the attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus. On the other hand, atom S is smaller than atom L, meaning its valence electrons are closer to the nucleus. As a consequence, the shielding effect in atom S is lower than in atom L because there are fewer inner electrons to shield the attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus. In conclusion, the shielding effect in atom S is lower than in atom L, as atom S is smaller with fewer inner electrons, resulting in a more significant attractive force between its valence electrons and the nucleus than in atom L. This difference in shielding effect also contributes to the variation in ionization energies between the two atoms, with atom S having a higher ionization energy than atom L due to its lower shielding effect and stronger electron-nucleus attraction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

Write a text based on \\"australian dollar continues falling\\" Text:","output":"Title: Australian Dollar's Ongoing Descent: Analyzing Potential Influences and Possible Impacts Introduction: The Australian Dollar (AUD) has faced a constant downward trajectory in recent times, causing concerns and speculation among investors, businesses, and citizens alike. This fall in value has sparked discussions on the possible reasons behind the decline and potential implications for Australia's economy, international trade, and the global financial situation. In this article, we will delve deeper into these aspects to obtain a better understanding of the ongoing depreciation of the Australian Dollar. Reasons for the Australian Dollar's Decline: 1. Economic Slowdown: The slowdown in the Australian economy has played a significant role in driving down the value of the Australian Dollar. Factors like weak consumer spending, slow wage growth, and lower business investments have contributed to this slowdown. Additionally, falling property prices have also negatively impacted the country's economic growth. 2. Global Uncertainty: The ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China have led to uncertainty in the global market, affecting the value of currencies worldwide. As Australia strongly depends on its trade with China, any slowdown in Chinese economic growth is likely to affect the Australian economy, and in turn, the Australian Dollar. 3. Interest Rate Cut: The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has cut interest rates multiple times in recent months to counter the economic slowdown. A lower interest rate generally signifies a weaker economy, hence putting downward pressure on the AUD. 4. Strength of the US Dollar: The US Dollar has strengthened significantly over recent years, leading to the depreciation of other currencies, including the Australian Dollar. Investors often prefer to hold assets in a strong currency, causing a shift in investments away from the AUD. Implications of the Falling Australian Dollar: 1. International Trade: A weaker Australian Dollar can lead to mixed outcomes in international trade. While a lower AUD makes Australian exports more competitive, it also increases the cost of imports, which could lead to inflationary pressures. 2. Tourism and Education: A weaker Australian Dollar makes the country more attractive for international tourists, providing an opportunity to boost the nation's tourism industry. Additionally, it makes studying in Australia more affordable for international students, potentially increasing Australia's education sector revenue. 3. Australian Businesses and Investors: For Australian businesses and investors holding assets overseas, the depreciation of the AUD can translate into increased wealth when converting foreign earnings back into Australian Dollars. However, businesses that mostly rely on imported goods will face higher input costs. 4. Consumer Spending: As the purchasing power of the Australian Dollar is reduced, Australians may experience higher prices on imported goods. This can affect consumer spending patterns and potentially cause a further slowdown in the economy. Conclusion: The continuing fall of the Australian Dollar serves as a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can boost the competitiveness of exports, tourism, and the education sector. On the other hand, it can increase the cost of living, affecting consumer spending and businesses relying on imports. Despite the negative effects, if managed well, the depreciation of the AUD presents an opportunity for the country to strengthen its economic domains and remain resilient in times of global uncertainty. Financial institutions, policymakers, and leaders must closely monitor the situation to mitigate adverse impacts and capitalize on possible benefits."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

OPTIONS: (I) movement of water away from the equator (II) cyclical variations in the height of high tides (III) reduction in velocity with distance from Earth's poles (IV) deflection of water toward the direction of airflow Answer:","output":"The drag of wind on the ocean surface plays a significant role in the formation and behavior of ocean surface currents. This force, along with other factors like the Coriolis Effect, temperature and salinity differences, and the Earth's rotation, influences the properties of ocean surface currents. Examining the given options, the correct answer can be deduced: (I) Movement of water away from the equator: While the drag of wind does move water, it is not specifically responsible for moving water away from the equator. This movement is driven by a combination of factors, including the trade winds and westerly winds near the equator, which cause water to move poleward through Ekman Transport. (II) Cyclical variations in the height of high tides: Tides are primarily influenced by the gravitational forces exerted by the moon and the sun on Earth. Although wind can influence the movement of water near the coast and sometimes intensify storm surges, the cyclical variations in tidal heights are not caused by wind. (III) Reduction in velocity with distance from Earth's poles: Although the wind has a considerable influence on the velocity of ocean surface currents, it does not entirely account for the reduction in velocity with distance from the Earth's poles. Some amount of velocity reduction is due to a combination of the drag of wind and the Coriolis Effect, but it's not exclusively responsible for this phenomenon. (IV) Deflection of water toward the direction of airflow: Wind causes the ocean surface to move, and the drag of wind on the ocean exerts a force on the water, ultimately transferring energy from the atmosphere to the ocean. This force creates surface currents that move in the same direction as the wind. The deflection of water towards the direction of airflow is the most accurate feature of ocean surface currents that results from the drag of wind on the ocean surface. Therefore, answering the question posed, the drag of wind results in the following feature of ocean surface currents: deflection of water toward the direction of airflow (Option IV)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers  and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\".  In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\".

That's a good question. Many people insist that ideas about right and wrong are merely personal opinions. Some voices, though, are calling Americans back to traditional moral values. William J. Bennett, former U.S. Secretary of Education, edited the Book of Virtues in 1993 to do just that. Bennett suggests that great moral stories can build character. The success of Bennett ' s book shows that many Americans still believe in moral values. But what are they?     One of the most basic moral values for Americans is honesty. The well-known legend about George Washington and the cherry tree tells this value clearly. Little George cut down his father's favorite cherry tree while trying out his new axe. When his father asked him about it, George said honestly, \\"I can not tell a lie. I did it with my axe.\\" Instead of punishment, George received his father's praise for telling the truth.  Sometimes American honesty-being open and direct-can offend people.  But Americans still believe that \\"honesty is the best policy.\\"      Another virtue Americans respect is perseverance. Remember Aesop's fable( )about the rabbit and the turtle that had a race? The rabbit thought he could win easily, so he took a nap. But the turtle finally won because he didn't give up.      Sympathy may be the queen of American virtues. The story of \\"The Good Samaritan\\" from the Bible describes a man who showed sympathy. On his way to a certain city, a Samaritan man found a poor traveler lying on the road. The traveler had been beaten and robbed. The kind Samaritan, instead of just passing by, stopped to help this person in need.      In no way can these brief descriptions cover all the moral values honored by Americans. Responsibility, loyalty, courage, gratitude and many others could be discussed. In fact, Bennett's bestseller-over 800 pages-highlights just 10 virtues. Even Bennett admits that he has only covered the surface. But no matter how long or short the list is, moral values are invaluable, they are the...

The story about George Washington and the cherry tree emphasizes the importance of telling the truth. Step 3: Eliminate irrelevant options We can eliminate options C) and D) because they don't address honesty as a moral value. Step 4: Choose the correct answer based on the text Between options A) and B), B) better captures the importance of honesty as an American moral value. Though option A) may be true, it doesn't focus on the core value of honesty.

Though there're many kinds of resources, with the fast increase of population and the increase of many more factories, the more we use, the fewer there will be left for the future. Oil is getting less and less year after year. It's said that oil can last for only 50 years. Natural gas perhaps will last about 38 years. Oil can be used in many ways and it's difficult to imagine what the modern world will be like without oil. But oil isn't easy to find and get out of the earth. Men must study the rocks. When they think the rocks in a certain place may have oil, a metal tower is built. A machine in the tower cuts a hole down into the ground. At the same time, a steel pipe is pushed down to stop the sides from falling in and to keep out water. At last if the men are right, usually the oil rushes up the sides with great force by the pressure of the gas in the top of the rock, and it rushes high into the air. If the oil catches a light, there will be a terrible fire. So a kind of cover is fixed on the top of the pipe, and the oil can run out through taps . If we are near the middle of the oil field, we can also get gas. Such gas is sent through pipes to towns far away and used in houses and factories like coal gas. Today oil is under pressure as never before. The price of oil keeps rising all the time. In many countries, the governments encourage people to save oil as much as possible. Question: Which of the following can be true according to  the passage? Options: A: Coal gas can't be used in houses and factories. B: Oil is very important in the modern world.

Always check up on the food, and remove it when it's gone bad. Skip onions, pasta (starchy foods), and anything with salt in it. Make sure to scrub your snail's food thoroughly before giving it to your snail. You want to make sure any pesticides are washed off so that your snail doesn't eat them. Place a shallow water dish in the snail's container for the snail to drink. This dish has the added benefit of providing humidity to the tank. Be sure to change it out once a day. Snails need a steady supply of calcium to maintain their shells. An easy way to provide it is to place a cuttlefish bone in the tank, which can be found at most pet stores.

In 1933, during the Great Depression, New York City vaudeville actress Ann Darrow is hired by financially troubled filmmaker Carl Denham to star in a film with Herb, Carl's cameraman, Mike, Carl's soundman, Preston, Carl's assistant, and actor Bruce Baxter. Ann learns her favorite playwright, Jack Driscoll, is the screenwriter. As their tramp steamer, the SS Venture, journeys to the mysterious Skull Island, Ann and Jack fall in love. The people on the ship consist of Englehorn the captain and his crew, including Hayes, a World War One veteran, Lumpy the cook, Choy the janitor, and the Venture's lookout Jimmy. Captain Englehorn has second thoughts about the voyage, prompted by Lumpy and Hayes' speculation of trouble ahead. Deep in the southern waters, the Venture receives a radio message informing Englehorn there is a warrant for Carl's arrest due to his defiance of the studio's orders to cease production. The message instructs Englehorn to divert to Rangoon, but the ship becomes lost in fog and runs aground on the rocky shore of Skull Island. Carl and his crew explore the island and are attacked by natives, who kill Mike as well as one of the sailors. Ann screams as she is captured, and a loud roar is heard beyond a wall. After this, the matriarch of the tribe targets Ann, muttering the word \\"Kong\\". Englehorn kills one of the natives and his crew break up the attack. Back on the ship, they lighten their load to float off the rocks and carry out repairs, but Jack discovers Ann has been kidnapped and another sailor has been killed. The natives offer Ann as a sacrifice to Kong, a 25 feet (7.6 m) tall gorilla. The crew returns fully armed, but is too late as Kong takes Ann and flees into the jungle.

However it is not easy to rely on tree and shrub roots to remove water from slopes and consequently help ensure slope stability. The ability to transpire in wet conditions is severely reduced and therefore any increase in soil strength previously gained in evaporation and transpiration will be lost or significantly reduced, consequently the effects of transpiration cannot be taken into account at these times. However it can be assumed that the chance of slope failure following saturation by storm event or periods of extended rainfall will be lessened as a result of transpiration. Moreover, although changes in moisture content will affect the undrained shear strength, the effective shear stress parameters as commonly used in routine slope stability analysis are not directly influenced by changing moisture content, although the water pressures (suctions) used in the analysis will change.[2][3].  Story: The two teams took different approaches in reinforcing the highway embankment slopes when building segments of the interstate. Team A led by Chuck relied almost entirely on inspiration and good building materials therefore decreasing slope stability, while team B lead by Mike used nature as an ally by planting tens of thousands of trees and shrubs to prevent slope failures and moderate soil transpiration and evaporation.

A:","output":"Skylar's decision to tilt Kendall's head back to kiss her on the mouth could have been motivated by various factors, which can be emotional, physical, or circumstantial. It is essential to understand that this analysis is speculative, as we cannot accurately assess Skylar's intentions without direct insight. That said, some possible reasons for Skylar's actions include: 1. Comfort and ergonomics: By tilting Kendall's head back, Skylar might have been aiming to make it more comfortable for both of them during the kiss. Depending on their height difference, this might have helped align their faces better, ensuring that their lips met at a comfortable angle. 2. Intimacy and deep connection: Skylar could have been seeking a deeper sense of emotional and physical intimacy with Kendall. Tilting someone's head back during a kiss can be a tender and caring gesture, suggesting that the person values close connection and wants to create a genuinely shared moment. 3. Dominance and assertiveness: In some cases, this gesture can represent an attempt to establish dominance or a more assertive role within the relationship or interaction. By tilting Kendall's head back, Skylar may have been displaying a subtle desire to take control and lead the particular situation. 4. Expression of passion and desire: Tilting Kendall's head back might have been a way for Skylar to demonstrate their passion and enthusiasm for the relationship. It could signal that Skylar feels a strong attraction to Kendall and wanted to establish a passionate and intense moment. 5. Surprising Kendall with a romantic gesture: Sometimes, people will tilt their partner's head back during a kiss to catch them off-guard and create a memorable, romantic moment. Skylar may have wanted to surprise Kendall and make the kiss feel more special and memorable to both of them. 6. Following cues from pop culture: Movies, television shows, and other forms of media often depict romantic encounters in specific ways to evoke emotion. Skylar might have mimicked this gesture from a favorite romantic scene, believing it would create a similarly passionate experience for Kendall and themselves. In conclusion, it is difficult to pinpoint why Skylar tilted Kendall's head back to kiss her on the mouth without more context and understanding of their relationship dynamic.

Several states enacted laws which required executions to be conducted within a \\"wall\\" or \\"enclosure\\" to \\"exclude public view.\\" For example, in 1919, the Missouri legislature adopted a statute (L.1919, p. 781) which required, \\"the sentence of death should be executed within the county jail, if convenient, and otherwise within an enclosure near the jail.\\" The Missouri law permitted the local sheriff to distribute passes to individuals (usually local citizens) whom he believed should witness the hanging, but the sheriffs – for various reasons – sometimes denied passes to individuals who wanted to watch. Missouri executions conducted after 1919 were not \\"public\\" because they were conducted behind closed walls, and the general public was not permitted to attend.

Write an article based on this summary: Transport officials in Washington DC have blocked plans by an American free speech pressure group to have a controversial cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad displayed on the subway. Article:","output":"Title: Washington DC Transport Officials Reject Display of Controversial Muhammad Cartoon on Subway Introduction Transport officials in Washington DC recently decided to block the request made by an American free speech pressure group who wanted a controversial cartoon depicting Prophet Muhammad placed in the city's subway system. The situation has raised widespread debates on the importance of free speech and the difference between promoting free expression and propagating hate speech or offensive material. This article will examine the circumstances around this decision, the opinions of both opponents and proponents, and some potential implications of this controversial situation. Background The American free speech pressure group attempting to place the contentious cartoon advertisement in the subway system is the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI). The organization is classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center and is known for troublesome, anti-Islamic activities. AFDI had hoped to use the publicity from displaying the cartoon as a means of promoting their mission and stance on free speech, a move deemed to be offensive and provoking by many. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's Decision In response to the request made by AFDI, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) rejected the application, citing safety concerns and the potential for inciting violence as the primary reasons behind their decision. WMATA stated that the display of the controversial cartoon on the subway could lead to public unrest, hostile sentiments, and even acts of terror, prompting them to prioritize the safety of commuters and staff. According to their guidelines, the transit authority holds the right to decline any advertising campaign that is deemed to incite or provoke violence, or which has the potential to harm or disrupt public order. In this case, the content's inflammatory nature and the potential backlash were determined to be reason enough to deny the capabilities of showcasing the cartoon in the transit system. Debate: Free Speech vs. Hate Speech This situation has sparked a significant debate regarding the boundaries of free speech in a democratic society. Proponents of featuring the cartoon argue that the rejection of the display undermines the freedom of expression and sets a dangerous precedent for censorship. They maintain that the mere existence of a controversial and offensive image should not be grounds for suppressing it. Conversely, opponents believe that the AFDI's attempt to display the cartoon of Prophet Muhammad in the subway system was not a genuine effort to promote free speech, but rather a calculated provocation aimed at one specific religious group. They point out that there is a significant difference between advocating for free speech and actively promoting hate speech, and that the latter should never be encouraged or tolerated. Conclusion The decision made by the WMATA to block the display of the controversial cartoon raises important questions about the limits of free speech and the role of public institutions in ensuring the safety and well-being of the public. While upholding the right to free expression is fundamental in a democratic society, it is crucial to strike a balance between this right and the protection of individuals from hate speech or offensive content that could provoke violence and endanger public order. It is essential that freedom of speech is maintained and supported, but the WMATA decision serves to remind us that there may be instances where safety concerns and the potential for hate speech to incite violence must be examined and addressed. As societies continue to grapple with these complex issues, it is crucial to engage in open, respectful dialogue about the balance between free speech, personal liberties, and social responsibilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
