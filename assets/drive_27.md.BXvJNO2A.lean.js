Summarize the following: Go online and take notes on information about how to protect yourself from scams and identity theft. This information will be essential when it comes time to discuss the possibility of getting a Facebook account. Look for apps and firewall software that will monitor risky activity on your computer to prevent viruses and malware. Your parents may want additional protection if they agree to let you use social media. You have to be at least 13 years old to create a Facebook Account. This limit may be different in certain countries. Before you talk to your parents about getting a Facebook account, jot down all of the reasons that you want to make a profile on a piece of paper. Consider which reasons your parents are likely to agree with, and focus on those. Write out a few points that you can make when talking to your parents.  “Because it’s fun” or “I want one” are not good reasons for getting a profile. Think about the features that you plan on using and focus on those. “I need a Facebook account to remember birthdays,” “I want to talk to my friends outside of school,” and “I can be invited to important events” are all valid reasons for wanting a Facebook profile. Facebook may have a reputation as a waste of time, but there are plenty of valid reasons to get a Facebook page. When building an argument, focus on how easy Facebook makes it easy to talk to people that you would otherwise lose touch with. If you have family members on Facebook, say that you want to get closer to them. If you’re almost at the age where you can get a job, point out that Facebook is an excellent way to network and learn about new opportunities. Your parents may not know that Facebook is used as a networking site. Find a public Facebook group that focuses on job hunting. Show it to them, and explain that Facebook can serve as a positive tool if you use it correctly. before presenting your argument. One of the worst things that you can do is get up in front of your parents without having practiced your speech. Once you’ve identified some reasons that you should have a Facebook, practice explaining them out loud in your room. Look at yourself in a mirror as you speak to see how your body language is influencing your argument. Practicing your presentation is a good way to figure out which arguments you feel confident about, which can give you a clue about where to start your speech. Your parents are likely going to raise concerns about your privacy and safety when you’re online. To respond to this counterargument, explain to them that you can block strangers on Facebook. You can also change your privacy settings to keep people from finding you in searches. Your parents may not know about the privacy features on Facebook. Don’t assume that they know how to change them, even if they have profiles themselves. Summary:","output":"To protect oneself from scams and identity theft, it is important to research apps, firewall software, and practices to prevent viruses and malware. Before discussing getting a Facebook account with parents, one should write down valid reasons for wanting a profile, focusing on features and benefits such as remembering birthdays, communication, and event invitations. Networking and job opportunities can also be highlighted. Practicing the presentation and discussing privacy settings and safety features on Facebook will help address any concerns parents may have."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who resented the marriage? from the following article ?  Ottavio's marriage troubled Alessandro; he struggled with the burden of chastity and entertained fantasies of marrying a princess. He resented his younger brother's arrangement; during the wedding ceremony he \\"became more deathly pale than death itself, and, so they say, is unable to bear this thing, that he, the first-born, should see himself deprived of such splendid status and of the daughter of an Emperor.\\" In 1546 Paul gave Pier Luigi the duchies of Parma and Piacenza as papal fiefs, a highly political move by the pope: in doing so he gave titles and wealth to Pier and appointed a lord who was subservient and owed a debt of gratitude, guaranteeing that the duchies would remain under papal control. At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.Titian was a personal friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death. Ottavio excelled as a military commander and was awarded the Golden Fleece by the emperor. While the post had been given as a means to strengthen the family position, it did not come without cost. His success bred resentment amongst his family, as he began to see himself unaccountable to Rome.At the time of the portrait Paul had convinced Alessandro to retain the post, hinting that he would later succeed him as pope – an aspiration that was ultimately...

Paul is a young womanizer living in a small Southern town, where he earns a living fixing cars for his uncle. Paul still lives with his mother, Elvira, who works as a clown cheering up children at the local hospital. He spends most of his time hanging out with his best friend and self-proclaimed partner-in-crime, Tip, and their friends Bo and Bust-Ass.

Let's look at the different parts of the phrase to break it down: 1. \\"Created a provocative, absorbing drama\\": This part of the phrase is primarily positive. It praises the work being described as thought-provoking and engaging. It suggests that the creator managed to craft something that elicits intellectual or emotional responses and holds the audience's attention. In this context, it serves as a compliment. 2. \\"Reveals the curse of a self-hatred\\": This part of the phrase indicates a negative subject matter or theme being presented in the drama. The phrase describes the \\"curse\\" or detrimental effect associated with self-hatred. Although the content discussed may be somber or disturbing, it is not necessarily a negative assessment of the work itself. It merely highlights that the drama explores these darker aspects of the human experience. 3. \\"Instilled by rigid social mores\\": This part of the phrase offers insight into the source or cause behind the self-hatred depicted in the drama. It points to inflexible social norms that contribute to the feeling of self-hatred experienced by the characters. It serves as a social critique, showcasing how societal expectations and rules can negatively impact individuals. Taking all parts of the phrase into account, it is evident that it provides a comprehensive assessment of the drama being discussed. Although certain elements of the phrase focus on negative subject matters or themes, the overall evaluation of the work is positive. The phrase commends the creator for successfully producing a captivating and evocative drama, while also shedding light on the darker side of the human psyche caused by constrictive social mores. In essence, the phrase's positive aspect lies in how the drama is able to captivate and provoke audiences, while the negative aspect pertains to the subject matter being explored within the drama. Ultimately, it can be inferred that the phrase demonstrates appreciation for the creator's ability to address serious and somber themes effectively, thus allowing for a more profound understanding of human emotions and societal impacts."},{"instruction":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

In 1483, a conspiracy arose among a number of disaffected gentry, many of whom had been supporters of Edward IV and the \\"whole Yorkist establishment\\". The conspiracy was nominally led by Richard's former ally and first cousin once removed Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, although it had begun as a Woodville-Beaufort conspiracy (being \\"well under way\\" by the time of the duke's involvement). Indeed, Davies has suggested that it was \\"only the subsequent parliamentary attainder that placed Buckingham at the centre of events\\", in order to blame a single disaffected magnate motivated by greed, rather than \\"the embarrassing truth\\" that those opposing Richard were actually \\"overwhelmingly Edwardian loyalists\\". It is possible that they planned to depose Richard III and place Edward V back on the throne, and that when rumours arose that Edward and his brother were dead, Buckingham proposed that Henry Tudor should return from exile, take the throne and marry Elizabeth of York, elder sister of the Tower Princes. However, it has also been pointed out that as this narrative stems from Richard's own parliament of 1484, it should probably be treated \\"with caution\\". For his part, Buckingham raised a substantial force from his estates in Wales and the Marches. Henry, in exile in Brittany, enjoyed the support of the Breton treasurer Pierre Landais, who hoped Buckingham's victory would cement an alliance between Brittany and England.  Some of Henry Tudor's ships ran into a storm and were forced to return to Brittany or Normandy, while Henry himself anchored off Plymouth for a week before learning of Buckingham's failure. Buckingham's army was troubled by the same storm and deserted when Richard's forces came against them. Buckingham tried to escape in disguise, but was either turned in by a retainer for the bounty Richard had put on his head, or was discovered in hiding with him. He was convicted of treason and beheaded in Salisbury, near the Bull's Head Inn, on 2 November. His widow, Catherine Woodville, later married Jasper Tudor, the uncle of Henry Tudor, who was in the process of organising another rebellion.  Richard made overtures to Landais, offering military support for Landais's weak regime under Duke Francis II of Brittany in exchange for Henry. Henry fled to Paris, where he secured support from the French regent Anne of Beaujeu, who supplied troops for an invasion in 1485. The French government, recalling Richard's effective disowning of the Treaty of Picquigny and refusal to accept the accompanying French pension, would not have welcomed the accession of one known to be unfriendly to France.

[I] no; [II] yes;","output":"[I] no Sickle cell anemia, also known as sickle cell disease, is a genetic disorder affecting the shape and functionality of red blood cells. The origin of sickle cell anemia can be traced back to a genetic mutation in the HBB gene, which codes for the production of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein responsible for transporting oxygen in the blood. The HBB gene mutation responsible for sickle cell anemia occurred thousands of years ago in parts of Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Arabian Peninsula. The mutation provided a selective advantage in areas where malaria was prevalent because individuals with one copy of the mutated gene (heterozygous) were less likely to suffer severe complications from the disease. This heterozygous advantage meant that the mutated gene was passed down through generations and spread throughout the populations in those regions. Historically, malaria was a significant cause of death in these regions, and the partial protection against it provided by the sickle cell trait gave carriers a survival advantage. As a result, the genetic mutation persisted even though it can cause sickle cell anemia in individuals who inherit two copies of the mutated gene. Over time, the spread of populations and migration led to the distribution of the sickle cell trait to various parts of the world. Sickle cell anemia is transferred from one generation to another through autosomal recessive inheritance. Each individual has two copies of the HBB gene – one from each parent. If both parents are carriers of the mutated HBB gene, there is a 25% chance that their children will inherit two copies of the mutation, resulting in sickle cell anemia. In contrast, there is a 50% chance the child will inherit one copy of the mutation and one normal gene, making them a carrier, and a 25% chance that they will inherit two normal genes, resulting in no sickle cell trait. The questions are not the same as the first one asks about the origin of sickle cell anemia, while the second question focuses on its mode of transmission through generations. Understanding the origin of the disease helps us trace its historical background and evolutionary context, while knowing how it is transferred gives us insight into the genetics and inheritance patterns of sickle cell anemia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington. The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set With the Lights Out, while shorter clips are included on the Nevermind Classic Albums DVD, as well as the documentary film Hype! As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \\"Come out and play, make up the rules\\" instead of the eventual opening of \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\". A recording of the earlier version appears on With the Lights Out and again on Sliver: The Best of the Box. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke, filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth. Nirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \\"our little group has always been\\" changed to \\"our little tribe has always been\\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah. Rolling Stone remarked that the Wishkah version of \\"Teen Spirit\\" \\"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\\". A notable alternate performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" occurred on BBC's Top of the Pops in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain sang in a deliberately low voice and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \\"Load up on guns, bring your friends\\" became \\"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\\").   Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When Top of the Pops was cancelled in 2006, The Observer listed Nirvana's performance of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" as the third greatest in the show's history. This performance can be found on the 1994 home video Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!.

In summer, one basic play of about half an hour is performed on beaches all around Britain .Mr. Punch, who has an enormous nose and wears a curved hat, gets into trouble and has argumentswith his wife, Judy. A policeman , a crocodile, and a hangman, and all of them run after Mr. Punch .He ,of course, _ manages to survive to fight another day . In Belgium wooden puppets first appeared in the 1820s in cities like liege . The liege puppetsare in fact string puppets without strings!They have a single rod attached to their heads, whichmeans the puppeteers aren't able to raise the arms and legs, but can move the body up and down and the head from side to side. Many of the stories used to be historical or religious but it is Tchantches,a comic character wit patched trousers and a big black hat, who is the best loved character today.

Lovering then joined Santiago's band The Martinis, appearing on their song \\"Free\\" on the soundtrack of Empire Records. However, he soon left the band to become a touring drummer for Cracker. Lovering moved from band to band, drumming with Tanya Donelly's group on 1997's Lovesongs for Underdogs and with Boston band Eeenie Meenie. After facing difficulty finding new work, Lovering gave up the drums and moved into a rented house that banned drumming.Towards the end of the 1990s, Lovering's friend Grant-Lee Phillips took him to a magic convention. Lovering was very impressed by some of the illusions, and later said \\"I had to learn how to do it\\". Mutual friend Carl Grasso invited them to a show at the Magic Castle, a magic-oriented nightclub in Los Angeles. There Lovering met Possum Dixon frontman Rob Zabrecky, and the pair soon became friends. Zabrecky convinced Lovering to apply for a performers' membership to the Magic Castle. After gaining his membership, Lovering reinvented himself as \\"The Scientific Phenomenalist\\". His act combined his electrical engineering knowledge with his stage performance experience.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Article: \\"Keep out or I'll chase you out! This is my property!\\" You hear this every spring. It is a long musical sound --- a bird song! Birds use their songs to communicate different messages to one another. People who study bird sounds are learning their meanings. Usually it is the male that sings. Early in spring he sings to say that he has picked out a piece of property. He sings to attract a female of his same kind. Together they will raise a family in his territory  . He sings to tell all other birds of his kind to keep out. Each kind of bird has its own type of song. Cardinals sing something that sounds a little like \\"What cheer, cheer, cheer.\\" Towhees sing, \\"Drink your tea.\\" Most of the time, birds pay attention only to the songs of birds of their own kind. Cardinals answer cardinals, and song sparrows answer song sparrows. A cardinal knows that a song sparrow will not try to steal its mate. So you can see one reason why a cardinal may chase away another cardinal but will not bother a song sparrow. Most different kinds of birds eat different things. To find enough to eat, a bird needs a big piece of land to search in. Many kinds of birds have some ways of dividing up the land into territories. Song sparrows, cardinals ovenbirds, and white-throated sparrows are some of the birds that have territorial systems. Especially in early spring, birds work out the boundaries between their territories by singing \\"keep out\\" threats and by chasing and fighting each other. The birds continue singing to tell females that they have set up territories. Neighboring birds seem to agree that there are make believe fences between their pieces of property. Then they do not have to waste energy chasing each other instead of taking care of their young. Scientists guessed that some birds could recognize their neighbors by small differences in their songs. Two scientists who studied white-throated sparrows found that these birds can even tell the difference between songs of individual birds of their own kind. White-throated sparrows...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Louis Leo Holtz (born January 6, 1937) is a former American football player, coach, and analyst. He served as the head football coach at The College of William & Mary (1969-1971), North Carolina State University (1972-1975), the New York Jets (1976), the University of Arkansas (1977-1983), the University of Minnesota (1984-1985), the University of Notre Dame (1986-1996), and the University of South Carolina (1999-2004), compiling a career record of 249-132-7. Holtz's 1988 Notre Dame team went 12-0 with a victory in the Fiesta Bowl and was the consensus national champion. Holtz is the only college football coach to lead six different programs to bowl games and the only coach to guide four different programs to the final top 20 rankings. After two seasons as a commentator for CBS Sports, Holtz came out of retirement in 1999 and returned to the University of South Carolina, where he had been an assistant in the 1960s. The year before Holtz arrived, the Gamecocks went 1-10, and the team subsequently went 0-11 during Holtz's first season. In his second season, South Carolina went 8-4, winning the Outback Bowl over the heavily favored Ohio State Buckeyes. The eight-game improvement from the previous year was the best in the nation in 2000 and the third best single-season turnaround in NCAA history. It also earned National Coach of the Year honors for Holtz from Football News and American Football Coaches Quarterly. In his third season, Holtz's success continued, leading the Gamecocks to a 9-3 record and another Outback Bowl victory over Ohio State. The nine wins for the season were the second highest total in the history of the program. Under Holtz's leadership, the Gamecocks posted their best two-year mark in school history from 2000 to 2001, going 17-7 overall and 10-6 in SEC play.  After consecutive 5-7 campaigns in 2002 and 2003, Holtz finished his South Carolina tenure on a winning note with a 6-5 record in 2004. Holtz's time in Columbia saw the resurrection of Gamecock Football, as the program had only one bowl win and no Top 25 finishes in the ten years before his hire. Upon his exit, USC had posted AP Top 25 finishes in 2000 and 2001 (#19 and No. 13 respectively) and had made consecutive New Year's Day bowls for the first time in its history. Holtz finished his six-year tenure at South Carolina with a 2-4 record versus his former team, Arkansas, beating the Razorbacks in Columbia, SC in 2000 and 2004.  In 2005, the NCAA imposed three years probation and reductions in two scholarships on the program for ten admitted violations under Holtz, five of which were found to be major. The violations involved improper tutoring and off-season workouts, as well as a lack of institutional control. No games were forfeited, and no television or postseason ban was imposed. Holtz issued a statement after the sanctions were announced stating, \\"There was no money involved. No athletes were paid. There were no recruiting inducements. No cars. No jobs offered. No ticket scandal.\\" What were the violations for?","output":"The violations were for improper tutoring and off-season workouts, as well as a lack of institutional control.

A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

Join the divestment movement.\\"","output":"Title: The Power of Unity: How Talking, Contacting, and Joining Forces Can Create Change Introduction In today's fast-paced society, it's easy to feel disconnected from our communities and the people around us. When we're surrounded by pressing problems such as climate change, social inequality, and a plethora of political issues, it's all too tempting to bury our heads in the sand and hope that someone else will fix things. But change begins at the grassroots level, and we must seize every opportunity to work together to make a real difference. This article will delve into the incredible potential and importance of talking to friends and neighbors, contacting elected officials, and joining the divestment movement. Step 1: Talk to Your Friends and Neighbors Begin by fostering conversations within your circles of trust and within your community. Communication is vital to gaining a comprehensive understanding of the issues and challenges that people face daily. Consider the following steps as you engage with friends and neighbors: - Research top-of-mind issues; - Share information you've learned; - Encourage open and respectful dialogue; - Offer personal perspectives without imposing your beliefs on others; and - Create a space where everyone can voice their opinions. Not only will these conversations help expand your knowledge about ongoing issues, but they'll also create a ripple effect, spreading awareness and motivating action in your community. Step 2: Contact Your Elected Officials Elected officials are the individuals entrusted with representing their constituents. By contacting them, you can share your concerns and provide input on policy-making. Here's how to effectively engage with your elected officials: - Identify your local, state, and national representatives; - Research their voting records and focus areas; - Craft a clear and concise message detailing your concerns or support; - Use different channels to reach out, such as emails, phone calls, and social media; and - Be respectful and professional, regardless of your personal opinions. Regular contact with your elected officials is important because it allows your voice to be heard and contributes to democratic accountability. Step 3: Join the Divestment Movement Finally, consider joining the divestment movement to show your support for a sustainable, equitable future. Divestment is the act of removing investments from organizations that contribute to social, environmental, and ethical issues. These may include fossil fuel industries, tobacco companies, or manufacturers of controversial weapons. Here's how to become part of the divestment movement: - Educate yourself about the different causes, ethical investments, and ongoing campaigns; - Identify where your personal, pension, or institutional investments lie; - Reach out to organizations, community groups, and networks advocating for divestment; - Attend divestment events, demonstrations, and workshops; and - Share your experiences and knowledge with others, fostering change within your spheres of influence. Joining the divestment movement amplifies your impact and demonstrates to the global community that people are demanding change. Conclusion The power of unity in creating change is immense, and even small, individual actions can significantly contribute to affecting positive change. By talking to your friends and neighbors, reaching out to elected officials, and supporting the divestment movement, you're not only taking a stand but also motivating others to join you. The more we collaborate, communicate, and act in solidarity, the closer we come to achieving a fair, just, and sustainable world for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said it would be \\"a real challenge to keep people safe\\" if front-line officers are reduced. The Met believes it will face cuts of up to Â£1bn when a spending review looking at funding levels beyond 2015/16 is announced on 25 November. The Home Office said forces would still have the resources to do their work. London mayor Boris Johnson said policing in the capital would not see cuts \\"anything like the order\\" of those suggested by Britain's most senior officer. He said while Mr Hogan-Howe's comments were \\"sensible\\", he did not think the cuts will be so severe. Mike Penning, minister for policing, crime, criminal justice and victims, said no final decisions had been made. However, he said how officers were deployed was what was important, \\"not how many of them there are in total.\\" But, Sir Bernard said as London was expected to grow by one million people over the next 10 to 15 years, cuts would make the police's job much more difficult. \\"We are going to see less visibility, we will see less patrolling, and we'll be slower to respond because there will be fewer of us\\", he said. Mr Johnson said he had kept police numbers high during his eight-year tenure despite cuts across the country. \\"It is up to us to make the case for London and that's what we are going to do in the course of the next few weeks. \\"But the case has always been very strong, which is that London's population is growing,\\" he added. Stephen Greenhalgh, deputy mayor for policing and crime in London, said he was \\"extremely concerned\\" by the potential cuts that he said he would fight \\"tooth and nail\\". He blamed the formula used to calculate how policing budgets are allocated across the country, describing it as \\"ill-conceived and poorly thought through\\". However, some groups believe savings could be made by reducing frontline officers because new types of crime had meant policing had changed. Andrew Haldenby, director of the think tank Reform, said forces required a better mix of employees with fewer \\"traditional police officers\\". \\"We need more different kinds of police employees, for example doing cyber crime and domestic violence,\\" he said.","output":"Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe warns that cutting £1 billion from the policing budget would make it harder for the police force to respond quickly and to keep London safe as the population grows."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs.

Q:WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure.

A: Pick your answer from: [-] warning howls [-] ejected quills [-] sweet odor [-] foul smell Answer:","output":"When skunks are in danger, they give off a foul smell. This pungent odor serves as a defense mechanism to deter predators and protect the skunk from harm. Skunks possess specialized glands called anal glands, which produce a highly unpleasant liquid that contains sulfur compounds, such as thiols and thioacetates. These compounds are responsible for the strong, penetrating smell that is difficult to ignore and can linger for days. When a skunk senses danger, it will often raise its tail and display a warning posture to communicate its intention to spray if the threat continues. If the warning is not heeded, the skunk can forcefully eject this noxious substance from its anal glands, aiming it accurately toward the attacker's face. This foul-smelling liquid can cause temporary blindness and severe irritation in the eyes and nasal passages of the affected animal, giving the skunk a chance to escape. It is important to note that using this defense mechanism is not the skunk's first choice, as the process of replenishing their spray can take up to 10 days, during which they are more vulnerable to predators. Skunks are also capable of controlling the amount of spray released, preserving their limited supply for future encounters if needed. In summary, when skunks are in danger, they release a foul smell from their anal glands that serves as a powerful defense mechanism against predators. This highly effective deterrent allows skunks to protect themselves in the wild and maintain their status as a species known for their unique and formidable defenses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a soluble pattern recognition receptor which is classified as a long-pentraxin in the pentraxin family. It is known to play an important role in innate immunity, inflammatory regulation, and female fertility. PTX3 is synthesized by specific cells, primarily in response to inflammatory signals. Among these various cells, neutrophils have a unique PTX3 production system. Neutrophils store PTX3 in neutrophil-specific granules and then the stored PTX3 is released and localizes in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Although certain NET components have been identified, such as histones and anti-microbial proteins, the detailed mechanisms by which NETs localize, as well as capture and kill microbes, have not been fully elucidated. PTX3 is a candidate diagnostic marker of infection and vascular damage. In severe infectious diseases such as sepsis, the circulating PTX3 concentration increases greatly (up to 100 ng/mL, i.e., up to 100-fold of the normal level). Even though it is clearly implied that PTX3 plays a protective role in sepsis and certain other disorders, the detailed mechanisms by which it does so remain unclear. A proteomic study of PTX3 ligands in septic patients revealed that PTX3 forms a complex with certain NET component proteins. This suggests a role for PTX3 in which it facilitates the efficiency of anti-microbial protein pathogen clearance by interacting with both pathogens and anti-microbial proteins. We discuss the possible relationships between PTX3 and NET component proteins in the host protection afforded by the innate immune response. The PTX3 complex has the potential to be a highly useful diagnostic marker of sepsis and other inflammatory diseases.

That's where they were slain, ambush-style -- Saturday afternoon as they sat in their patrol car, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton said at an evening news conference. The gunman approached the passenger side of the patrol car and took a shooting stance, witnesses told police. He opened fire several times, striking both officers in the head, Bratton said. They were \\"shot and killed with no warning, no provocation,\\" Bratton told reporters. \\"They were quite simply, assassinated.\\" The gunman was found dead in a nearby subway station from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Question: What is the name of the band that has received six APRA Awards ?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers.

Is \\"Disappointed by the changes, tens of thousands of defections occurred during the first half of Rutherford's tenure, leading to the formation of several Bible Student organizations independent of the Watch Tower Society, most of which still exist.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What were all members instructed to report weekly to the Brooklyn headquarters?\\"","output":"No, the statement \\"Disappointed by the changes, tens of thousands of defections occurred during the first half of Rutherford's tenure, leading to the formation of several Bible Student organizations independent of the Watch Tower Society, most of which still exist.\\" does not directly answer the question about what all members were instructed to report weekly to the Brooklyn headquarters. To provide a better answer for the question, let's delve into the history and organization of the Watch Tower Society, focusing on the reporting instructions given to its members. The Watch Tower Society, now known as Jehovah's Witnesses, was formed by Charles Taze Russell in the late 19th century. This religious organization has its headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, and is known for its extensive door-to-door ministry and strict organizational structure. During the tenure of Judge Rutherford, the second president of the Watch Tower Society, there were significant changes in the organization's policies, doctrines, and practices. Some of these changes included a centralized hierarchical system, and an increased emphasis on organization and reporting. This period saw the introduction of weekly reporting, wherein all congregation members were instructed to report their preaching and evangelizing activities weekly to the Brooklyn headquarters. The weekly report typically included the following activities: 1. Hours spent in public preaching and door-to-door ministry. 2. Number of pieces of literature, including books, magazines, and tracts, distributed. 3. Amount of time spent in conducting Bible studies with individuals and families. 4. Any other relevant information related to their evangelizing efforts, such as special events or campaigns. The purpose of these weekly reports was to provide the organization with a comprehensive view of the preaching work being done around the world. The reports would help the leadership to assess the growth of the organization, allocate resources more efficiently, and devise strategies for further outreach efforts. It is noteworthy that during Rutherford's leadership, a significant number of members grew dissatisfied with the changes implemented within the organization, as mentioned in the initial statement. This dissatisfaction led to defections and the formation of several Bible Student organizations independent of the Watch Tower Society, some of which still exist today. In conclusion, to answer the question \\"What were all members instructed to report weekly to the Brooklyn headquarters?\\": Members of the Watch Tower Society, under the leadership of Joseph Franklin Rutherford, were instructed to report their evangelizing activities, such as time spent preaching, literature distributed, and time spent conducting Bible studies, to the Brooklyn headquarters on a weekly basis. This reporting system was introduced to better assess the growth of the organization and to allocate resources efficiently."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves,  is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

Based on the premise \\"Although the personal saving rate is low, economists do not agree on whether this is a problem or whether private saving is inadequate to finance domestic investment.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Economists all agree that private savings is a serious problem.\\" is true (see options)? Available options: + yes + it is not possible to tell + no","output":"No, we cannot conclude the hypothesis \\"Economists all agree that private savings is a serious problem.\\" as true, based on the premise given. The premise itself states that economists do not agree on whether the low personal saving rate is a problem or if private saving is inadequate to finance domestic investment. The field of economics encompasses a wide range of theories, methodologies, and perspectives; hence, it is not surprising that there might be varying opinions among economists. This disagreement may stem from multiple factors, such as differing assumptions, analysis methods, priorities, or interpretations of available data. Consequently, it is difficult to establish a consensus on a single hypothesis, especially when the topic is as complex as the relationship between private savings and domestic investment. Some economists argue that a low personal saving rate is an issue since higher private savings can help finance domestic investments, potentially leading to more robust economic growth, increased productivity, and job creation. They may further assert that more considerable savings can provide a cushion for individuals and families during economic downturns, reducing the reliance on public assistance programs. On the other hand, other economists might view the low personal saving rate as less of a concern as they believe that other sources of finance could compensate for the lack of private savings, such as foreign investment, government expenditure, or by borrowing. According to this perspective, the primary focus should be on optimizing economic policies and regulatory frameworks to attract investments, rather than emphasizing private savings. Furthermore, some economists might argue that a low personal saving rate could indicate a high degree of consumer confidence and strong consumption, which can drive economic growth. Thus, they may contend that a low personal saving rate is not inherently problematic. To sum up, the hypothesis that \\"Economists all agree that private savings is a serious problem\\" is not true as it contradicts the given premise. There is no consensus among economists about the severity of the low personal saving rate issue or its impact on domestic investment. The disagreement among economists highlights the complexities and nuances involved in understanding and analyzing the interplay between private savings and investment within an economy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lee, who called him his \\"Old War Horse.\\" He served under Lee as a corps commander for many of the famous battles fought by the Army of Northern Virginia in the Eastern Theater, but also with Gen. Braxton Bragg in the Army of Tennessee in the Western Theater. Biographer and historian Jeffry D. Wert wrote that \\"Longstreet ... was the finest corps commander in the Army of Northern Virginia; in fact, he was arguably the best corps commander in the conflict on either side.\\"  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - Suffolk is an East Anglian county of historic origin in England. It has borders with Norfolk to the north, Cambridgeshire to the west and Essex to the south. The North Sea lies to the east.

The Union faced secessionists in eleven Southern states grouped together as the Confederate States of America. The Union won the war, which remains the bloodiest in U.S. history.  - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC.  - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States.

Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Jeffry D.

Rio's slums the hot World Cup destination? updated 8:14 AM EST, Wed February 26, 2014 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- High above the beaches in Rio de Janeiro's hillside slums, you can get some of the best views in town. And now, they come from some of the cheapest rooms as well. With the World Cup less than four months away, residents in many once infamous favelas are opening their doors to tourists, renting beds, rooms or even entire houses, and building youth hostels. \\"If you want to see the World Cup, see some football matches and experience true Brazilian life you should really check this out,\\" says Michael Blommers, a Dutch backpacker staying at a hostel in the Vidigal shantytown. Beds at hostels in Copacabana and Ipanema beaches, which usually go for around 40 a night, are expected to cost as much as 400 during the World Cup. Hotels are even more expensive, with many requiring multiple-night stays. A tourist in Rio's Vidigal favela calls to a dog on a street. But a bunk at Alto Vidigal Hostel will set guests back just 65 -- four times the usual price, but still a relative bargain. Of course, visitors staying in Rio's favelas will likely be confronted with more than just a modest room. Garbage in these areas often piles up along the roads, while electricity, water and sewage services are spotty at best. Transportation can be precarious. The biggest concern, though, is security. Just a few years ago, Rio's favelas were controlled by drug lords. Police have since stormed many of them, in a process dubbed \\"pacification,\\" driving out armed gangs in an effort to make it relatively safe for residents and visitors. But they've had mixed results. Periodic gun battles continue in many favelas. Just last week, drug traffickers shot at police posts in Rocinha, one of the biggest shantytowns in Rio. Maria Clara dos Santos says she could hear the recent shootouts from her terrace. She rents rooms in her bright yellow house to foreign tourists and says safety depends on knowing where not to go and following rules. \\"Don't use drugs, don't bring girls home, keep it a nice environment,\\" she says. A Los Angeles native, Elliot Rosenberg has launched a website with an eye on the World Cup allowing residents to rent out rooms to foreigners. With some 600,000 foreign fans expected over the course of the tournament, there could be plenty of demand. But Rosenberg believes that many of those looking for rooms will be attracted by more than just the about 50 price tags on many rooms. \\"They want more authentic, lively, meaningful experiences,\\" he says. \\"They want to see the real Rio.\\" And, of course, those great views don't hurt either.

However, visitors staying in Rio's favelas may have to deal with issues such as garbage piles, spotty utility services, and safety concerns.

Summarize this article: Even when it isn’t really necessary, a short trip to the store can do a lot to alleviate boredom. Studies show that time spent walking is more exciting than time spent waiting around for something. It helps if you can accomplish something productive along the way, but if not, it is still better than sitting around at home. Try “gamifying” chores and other work. Give yourself points for each task you accomplish and reward yourself with a night out or new toy when you earn enough points. See how quickly you can clean the kitchen. Keep track of your times and see if you can beat your best! It has become easier than ever before to share your thoughts with the world. Spend your empty time practicing your writing and working out your thoughts. If people listen, you can begin selling advertisements for a bit of extra money or get your name out there as an expert on some topic.  If you have strong opinions about politics, food, or culture, try writing about those things. Otherwise, try writing stories, or just expressing your feelings. Similarly there are some websites that will compensate you for writing short articles. A number of survey websites allow you to make some money—usually not much—by telling them what you think. Some examples include SurveyMonkey, SurveySpot, My Survey, LIghtspeed Consumer Panel, Pinecone Research, Opinion OutPost, MyPoints, Springboard America, and Toluna. This is one way to spend your time and make a bit of cash on the side. Computer programs have bugs. To get out all the glitches and mistakes, programmers need people willing to play around with them. Websites like User Testing, WatusersDo, Enroll, and YouEye will compensate you for playing around with their programs. It isn’t a living, but it is one of the easiest ways to make money while wasting some time. Meditation might not seem like the most exciting activity, but it does increase concentration, which can help push away the sense of agitation that often comes with boredom. Try meditating about 20 minutes daily to increase your focus and clarity of mind. To meditate, close your eyes and clear your mind. Take one thing to focus on, perhaps an image in your head, a word, or a phrase. Think about that and whenever you mind begins to stray bring it back to the object of your attention.","output":"The article suggests various ways to alleviate boredom and make better use of one's time.

It digest food in two ways, mechanically and chemically. Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.

However, alarmed by the mounting losses of their spies, he is visited by the heads of the British ('M' or McTarry; John Huston), French (LeGrand; Charles Boyer), American (Ransome; William Holden) and Russian (Smernov; Kurt Kasznar) Secret Services (collectively driven by M's chauffer John LeMesurier), who petition him to return.

Answer:","output":"At San Quentin is the thirty-first overall album by Johnny Cash, recorded live at San Quentin State Prison on February 24, 1969. To understand the reasoning behind this answer, we need to look into Johnny Cash's discography and how it was arranged chronologically. Prior to \\"A Concert: Behind Prison Walls,\\" Johnny Cash had released numerous albums, with some of them being live performances recorded in prisons such as Folsom and San Quentin. The key phrase in the question is \\"Johnny Cash's conceptual series of live albums recorded before an audience of prison inmates.\\" This gives us the idea that the \\"At San Quentin\\" album is part of a series of prison live albums. By establishing the fifty-fourth album as \\"A Concert: Behind Prison Walls,\\" we can deduce the ordinal numeral of \\"At San Quentin.\\" Although there is no direct information about the exact ordinal numeral of \\"At San Quentin\\" with respect to the entire discography, it is possible to reason about it by looking into the time frame between the two albums' release dates and accounting for other albums in between. \\"At San Quentin\\" was released in 1969, while \\"A Concert: Behind Prison Walls\\" was recorded in 1974. In those five years, Johnny Cash released several more albums, totaling a difference of 23 between the ordinal numerals of the two albums. Since \\"A Concert: Behind Prison Walls\\" is the fifty-fourth album, and we know there is a difference of 23 ordinal numerals between it and \\"At San Quentin,\\" we can simply subtract 23 from 54 to arrive at the ordinal numeral for \\"At San Quentin\\": 54 - 23 = 31 Therefore, \\"At San Quentin\\" is the thirty-first overall album by Johnny Cash, recorded live at San Quentin State Prison on February 24, 1969."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The Rams opened the regular season at home against the Denver Broncos on September 10 with a Rams' 18-10 win. Jeff Wilkins scored all of the Rams' points by kicking six field goals, a franchise record for a single game (from 51, 48, 26, 38, 29 and 24 yards), and became the first Ram player to score 1000 points in a career. Wilkins also tied a franchise record of seven field goal attempts in one game which was first accomplished by Bob Waterfield on December 9, 1951. The Rams were unable to score a touchdown all game and went 0 for 5 in the red zone. The defense allowed just one touchdown and forced five turnovers. Three of these turnovers were interceptions, from a team that only allowed seven interceptions all of last season. First round draft pick Tye Hill intercepted a pass by Jake Plummer with 12:02 in the second quarter. It was his first in his NFL career. The defense also sacked Jake Plummer four times in the game, with Leonard Little accounting for two of them. Isaac Bruce passed Henry Ellard and Shannon Sharpe for 11th most receptions in an NFL career with his five receptions for 64 yards. Center Andy McCollum injured his left knee with 7:39 left in the second quarter and was out for the rest of the game. On September 11, 2006 it was announced that McCollum will miss the entire season and will undergo knee surgery.  With the win, the Rams began their season 1-0. Question: How many field goals between 20 and 30 yards were scored? Answer:","output":"To find the number of field goals scored between 20 and 30 yards, we need to check the distances of the six field goals made by Jeff Wilkins. The field goals were made from the following distances: 51, 48, 26, 38, 29, and 24 yards. Now, we check which of these values lie between 20 and 30 yards (inclusive): - 26 yards: This field goal falls within the range of 20-30 yards. - 29 yards: This field goal falls within the range of 20-30 yards. - 24 yards: This field goal falls within the range of 20-30 yards. There are three field goals that fall within the range of 20-30 yards. Therefore, the answer is: 3"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a question about the following article: The kingdom of Assam was the last conquest of Bodawpaya. In December 1816, he sent a 16,000-strong force to Assam to install his nominee, Chandra Kanta Singh, to the Assamese throne. From their northernmost forts in Hukawng Valley in present-day northern Kachin State, the Burmese army crossed the 9,000-foot high Himalayan Patkai range, and finally entered Assam in early 1817. The army decisively defeated the Assamese army at the battle of Kathalguri, near the Assamese capital Jorhat. A pro-Burmese minister Badan Chandra was installed, with Singh as the nominal king. The army left in April 1817 but instabilities resumed soon after, and Singh had to flee Jorhat. The army had to return in February 1819, and reinstated Singh. A large portion of the army remained in Assam to hunt down the rebels in Upper Assam. The authority rested with the Burmese commanders, not the nominal king. Unhappy with the arrangement, Singh switched his allegiance to the British in April 1821, and tried to drive out the Burmese. His first attack on the Burmese garrison at Gauhati in September 1821 failed. But reinforced by British arms and personnel, Singh took Gauhati in January 1822, and marched to Jorhat. But the capital had been reinforced by a 20,000-strong army led by Bandula, who had just arrived. Bandula defeated Singh on 17 April 1822 at Mahgarh near Jorhat. Singh fell back to Gauhati but was defeated by Gen. Maha Thilawa on 3 June 1822. The fallen king fled to the British territory, and continued to make raids in the years leading to the First Anglo-Burmese War.

(AP) — The parents of a New Jersey boy who was 4 when he fatally shot a 6-year-old neighbor have been ordered to pay nearly 600,000 to the slain youth's family.      Anthony and Melissa Senatore will also have to pay punitive damages to Brandon Holt's parents under the ruling issued Monday. But that amount hasn't been determined.      Anthony Senatore has admitted keeping a loaded .22-caliber rifle unlocked in his bedroom, where his son found it in April 2013. The boy took it outside and shot Brandon Holt once in the head.      Senatore received a three-year prison term last year after he pleaded guilty to child endangerment.      The rulings came in a wrongful death suit brought by Holt's family. The Senatores were ordered to pay 572,588. ||||| TOMS RIVER -- A Superior Court judge ordered the parents of a preschooler who shot his 6-year-old neighbor to death with a loaded rifle they kept under their bed to pay more than 570,000 to the dead boy's parents.      The 572,588.26 award Monday to Christine and Ronald Holt was Judge Robert Brenner's finding in the wrongful death suit the former Toms River couple brought against Anthony and Melissa Senatore in 2013 shooting death of their son Brandon Holt.      Anthony Senatore has not disputed leaving his loaded rifle under his bed before the April 8, 2013, shooting so Brenner was left to determine how much Senatore and his wife should have to pay the Holts for the services and companionship Brandon would have provided his parents in the future, for his pain and suffering before his death and for the family's unpaid medical and funeral expenses.      Brenner found Anthony Senatore 90 percent responsible for Brandon's death and Melissa Senatore 10 percent negligent because, he said, she should have known the weapon was under the bed. Photographs of the dark wood floor under the Senatores' bed showed it was not dusty and appeared to have been cleaned at some point.      Melissa Senatore was not in court and has not responded to the lawsuit, but Brenner said she still would be held responsible for her share of the judgment.      Anthony Senatore pleaded guilty to child endangerment in October 2014 and was sentenced in February 2015 to three years in prison. Under New Jersey's sentencing guidelines, he served nine months of that term before being released on parole.      Brandon, who lived two houses away from the Senatores on McCormick Drive in Toms River, was playing \\"pretend shooting\\" with the Senatores' 4-year-old son on April 8, 2013, when the younger boy grabbed his father's gun and shot his friend in the head outside the Senatores' rented house. Brandon died the following day at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune.      The trial, which lasted slightly less than two hours, included tearful testimony from Christine Holt, who described finding her son struggling to breathe after one of the Senatore told her Brandon was hurt. She said she didn't know he had been shot until she arrived at the hospital.      She described how she tried to comfort him as he lay on the seat of the Senatores' golf cart. His eyes were open, he was bleeding from his mouth and he was gasping for air, she said.      \\"I was rubbing his legs, telling him to breathe,\\" she said. \\"I kept telling him I loved him.\\"      Father of boy, 4, who shot and killed 6-year-old friend sentenced to prison      Anthony Senatore testified he told Ronald Holt that the boy was shot with his rifle, but Ronald Holt adamantly denied Senatore said anything about the weapon.      \\"I asked him what happened and he said his eye got grazed by a pellet gun,\\" Holt said.      \\"Isn't it true he told you your son was shot with a .22 (caliber) rifle,\\" Senatore's attorney, Robert Ebberup asked him on cross-examination.      \\"No,\\" Holt shot back.      Ebberup asked if it was possible Holt could have missed that comment in all the commotion.      \\"What I heard? What he told me? I know what he said,\\" Holt replied.      Brenner still has to rule on punitive damages against the Senatores but he said it would be based on their ability to pay. He gave the attorneys 30 days to determine the Senatores' financial assets.      Since the shooting, the Senatores have moved to Pine Beach and the Holts have moved to the Manahawkin section of Stafford Township. They have an 18-month-old son and Christine Holt started a charitable organization called \\"Brandon's Elves\\" to provide children in Ocean County's social services programs with Christmas gifts.      The trial was much shorter than the average wrongful death case because Senatore did not dispute his responsibility in Brandon's death and because the Senatores, as renters, had no homeowners insurance that would have involved another party.

(CBSNewYork) — It was a tragedy beyond comprehension that shattered the lives of two families in Toms River, New Jersey.      Six-year-old Brandon Holt was shot by his 4-year-old playmate with a gun that had been left unsecured, CBS2’s Christine Sloane reported. For the first time, the public heard from Brandon’s parents who testified Monday in the civil trial of the gun owner.      The mother and father relived the painful moment of running up to their neighbor’s home to find their 6-year-old son accidentally shot in the head by another child. He was still conscious in a gold cart, but later died in the hospital.      “He was laying on the bench like the seat laying down… he was bleeding,” mother Christine Holt said. “I was just rubbing his legs telling him I was there, telling him to breath ’cause he was trying to breath… I just kept telling him I loved him.”      Ronald Hold, the victim’s father, said he “could see [his] son’s eye really swollen and trying to catch his breath.”      Defendant Anthony Senatore confirmed that the gun in his son’s hand was his while testifying in the wrongful death suit against him.      Senatore said he forgot he had placed the .22-caliber rifle under his bed. He’s already served nine months in the criminal case.      “When the gun went off I turned around, realized what gun it had been so I immediately removed it from his hands,” he said. “My daughter had came around the side of my house and said, “Dad, Brandon was shot.'”      The judge is awarding the couple 572,588 dollars, but they say it wasn’t about the money.      “I just want everyone to now just lock up your guns. That’s what it was about today– just lock up your guns,” Christine Holt said.      The Holts told CBS2 they now have an 18-month-old child. Senatore’s attorney said the owner of the gun is suffering too.      The couple was awarded compensatory damages on Monday, but everyone is due back in court in a month for the judge’s punitive damages decision. |||||","output":"This case revolves around an incident that occurred in April 2013 in Toms River, New Jersey, where Anthony and Melissa Senatore's 4-year-old son fatally shot their 6-year-old neighbor, Brandon Holt, with a .22-caliber rifle that was kept unlocked in Anthony Senatore's bedroom. The young boy found the loaded gun, took it outside, and shot Brandon Holt in the head. As a result of this incident, the Senatores were brought to court for a wrongful death suit by the Holt family. In the trial, Judge Robert Brenner found Anthony Senatore to be 90 percent responsible for Brandon's death due to leaving the loaded gun under his bed, and deemed Melissa Senatore 10 percent negligent because she should have known the gun's whereabouts. The trial took less than two hours, and involved testimony from Brandon's mother, Christine Holt, who tearfully recounted the ordeal of discovering her son in a grave condition without initially knowing he had been shot. Anthony Senatore pleaded guilty to charges of child endangerment related to the incident in October 2014 and was subsequently sentenced in February 2015 to serve a three-year prison term. However, under New Jersey's sentencing guidelines, he was released on parole after serving nine months in prison. In addition to this, both Anthony and Melissa Senatore have been ordered to pay 572,588 to the Holt family due to the rulings from the wrongful death suit. This figure represents the compensation the Holts were awarded for the loss of their son, covering services and companionship he would have provided his parents in the future, his pain and suffering, and unpaid medical and funeral expenses of the family.  However, the Senatores' financial obligations are not concluded yet as they also have to pay punitive damages to the Holts. The amount for punitive damages remains undetermined as the court has yet to make a ruling on the matter and will base the amount on the Senatores' ability to pay. Both parties have been given 30 days to evaluate the Senatores' financial assets to help determine this amount. Both families have since moved, with the Holts continuing their life in the Manahawkin section of Stafford Township, where they have an 18-month-old son. In honor of their late son, they have also started a charitable organization called \\"Brandon's Elves\\" that provides Christmas gifts to children in Ocean County's social services programs. Despite the substantial sum awarded to them, the Holts expressed that the lawsuit was not about money, but rather a plea for responsible gun ownership. Christine Holt urged everyone to \\"just lock up your guns\\" to avoid future tragedies. The Senatores' lawyer mentioned that Anthony Senatore, as the owner of the gun involved in the tragic shooting, is also suffering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Where does Larry Wilson work? Title: Weekend at Bernie's Movie plot: Larry Wilson (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard Parker (Jonathan Silverman) are two low-level financial employees at an insurance corporation in New York City. While going over actuarial reports, Richard discovers a series of payments made for the same death. Richard and Larry take their findings to the CEO, Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), who commends them for discovering insurance fraud and invites them to his Hamptons island beach house for the Labor Day weekend. Unbeknownst to Larry and Richard, Bernie is behind the fraud. Nervously meeting with his mob partner Vito (Louis Giambalvo), Bernie asks to have Larry and Richard killed. However, after Bernie leaves, Vito decides Bernie has been attracting too much attention with his greed and his relationship with Vito's girlfriend, Tina (Catherine Parks), and orders that he be killed instead. Bernie arrives at the island before Larry and Richard and plans the murders with Paulie (Don Calfa), the hitman, on the phone, unaware the conversation is being recorded on his answering machine. Bernie then plants cash and a fake confession note implicating Larry and Richard in the insurance fraud. Paulie arrives, killing Bernie with a drug overdose. When Larry and Richard arrive at Bernie's house, they find Bernie's body. Before they can call the police, guests arrive for a party that Bernie used to host every weekend. To Larry and Richard's amazement, the guests are too engrossed in their partying to notice he is dead, with the dopey grin from the fatal injection and his sunglasses concealing his lifeless state.

Alan Pardew is set to drop £12million Remy Cabella as he admits there is one simple solution to easing the pressure on his position – victory at Swansea on Saturday. The Newcastle boss has endured another week of intense speculation regarding his future following Monday’s televised 1-0 loss at Stoke. Fans on the street have started to let their feelings be known and defeat at Swansea would make for an uncomfortable international fortnight. Remy Cabella (left) passes the ball whilst being challenged by Mike Williamson during training on Thursday Newcastle boss Alan Pardewis under intense pressure to turn around the club's fortunes Stoke is a tough game but","output":"Newcastle United have faced an even tougher challenge off the pitch as Alan Pardew has borne the brunt of fans' frustrations. His position as manager has become increasingly precarious due to a series of poor results, leading to intense discussions about his future at the club. In a bid to find a much-needed solution, Pardew has indicated that he is considering dropping Remy Cabella, the club's £12 million summer signing, ahead of Saturday's crucial clash against Swansea City. Arriving from Montpellier with a hefty price tag and high expectations, Remy Cabella has thus far failed to live up to the hype surrounding his transfer. The French international has struggled to adapt to the physicality and pace of the Premier League, and has not contributed the goals or assists that Newcastle so desperately need to climb up the table. It seems that Pardew has recognized the need for a change in his playing personnel, and Cabella's omission from the starting lineup could be the spark that ignites a turn in fortunes for the beleaguered manager and his team. The importance of a victory against Swansea cannot be overstated. Not only would it help to ease the mounting pressure on Pardew, but it would also serve as a morale boost for his players and the fans ahead of the international break. Given the turbulent atmosphere surrounding the club, an extended period without competitive fixtures could further isolate Pardew from his players and exacerbate the sense of dissatisfaction among the supporters. A victory at the Liberty Stadium, then, is of utmost importance, and Alan Pardew will be pulling out all the stops to secure those precious three points. In order to achieve this much-needed victory, Pardew will need to devise a tactical approach that counters Swansea's attacking threat whilst exploiting their defensive vulnerabilities. Swansea, who have enjoyed a relatively strong start to the season under Garry Monk, boast a dangerous attacking trio in Wilfried Bony, Gylfi Sigurdsson, and Jefferson Montero. Pardew must ensure that his defensive unit remains disciplined and well-organized, with captain Fabricio Coloccini playing a key role in marshaling the backline. Offensively, Newcastle must look to capitalize on Swansea's occasional lapses in concentration at the back and exploit the space vacated by their adventurous full-backs. In potentially dropping Remy Cabella, Pardew could be looking to field a more physically imposing player alongside the in-form Papiss Cissé to help unsettle the Swansea defense and hold up the ball for onrushing midfielders. Ultimately, the future of Alan Pardew at Newcastle United hinges on a delicate balancing act, with the pressure from impatient fans and the need for positive results threatening to overwhelm him. By making the bold decision to drop an underperforming Remy Cabella, Pardew has demonstrated that he is not afraid to make tough choices in the pursuit of turning his side's fortunes around. The game against Swansea promises to be a season-defining moment for both the manager and his players, and as they seek to silence their critics with a resounding victory, a challenging test awaits them at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra  Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes.  The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel. Question: What did the reviewer use?

It is in a style and genre that I generally enjoy a great deal. But... there isn't one single character in it I liked. Eddie Bear is probably the nearest it comes, and he's sweet but one-dimensional.

Question: Given the following context:  Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What castle did William the Conqueror give to the king's half brother?  It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were...

Once aboard he seeks out his runaway wife, Julia (Barbara Stanwyck). He discovers she is trying to take their two unsuspecting children, 18-year-old Annette (Audrey Dalton) and ten-year-old Norman (Harper Carter), to her hometown of Mackinac, Michigan, to raise as down-to-earth Americans rather than rootless elitists like Richard himself. As the ship prepares for departure, her captain, E. J. Smith (Brian Aherne), receives a hint from the shipping company representative that a record-setting speedy passage would be welcomed.

Healey (Richard Basehart), a Catholic priest who has been defrocked for alcoholism.

Julia concedes that her daughter is old enough to make her own decisions, but she insists on keeping custody of Norman. This angers Richard, forcing Julia to reveal that Norman is not his child, but rather the result of a one-night stand after one of their many bitter arguments.

Directed by the fearless visionary, Jack Lancaster, this gem of a film pays homage to classic monster movies and high school comedies from a bygone era while simultaneously bringing a fresh spin to the well-trodden genres. The film centers around a group of high school cheerleaders who, after an unfortunate accident involving experimental volcanic energy-infused hair products, begin to transform into enormous, ravenous monsters hellbent on devouring everything in sight and dominating the small, unsuspecting town. The town must rally together to fight off their massive ex-cheerleader foes, and unlikely alliances form as the nerdy science whiz kid (played brilliantly by rising star Charlie Thompson) and a grizzled, emotionally-wounded war veteran (a standout performance by veteran actor, Ron Dundee) team up, along with a ragtag band of townsfolk, to save the day.

Information:  - Physiology is the scientific study of the normal function in living systems. A sub-discipline of biology, its focus is in how organisms, organ systems, organs, cells, and biomolecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system. Given the size of the field, it is divided into, among others, animal physiology (including that of humans), plant physiology, cellular physiology, microbial physiology (microbial metabolism), bacterial physiology, and viral physiology. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded to those who make significant achievements in this discipline by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In medicine, a physiologic state is one occurring from normal body function, rather than pathologically, which is centered on the abnormalities that occur in animal diseases, including humans.  - The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, administered by the Nobel Foundation, is awarded once a year for outstanding discoveries in the fields of life sciences and medicine. It is one of five Nobel Prizes established in 1895 by Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, in his will. Nobel was personally interested in experimental physiology and wanted to establish a prize for progress through scientific discoveries in laboratories. The Nobel Prize is presented to the recipient(s) at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award. The front side of the medal provides the same profile of Alfred Nobel as depicted on the medals for Physics, Chemistry, and Literature; its reverse side is unique to this medal.  - Herbert Spencer Gasser ( 5 July 1888 -- 11 May 1963 ) was an American physiologist , and recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1944 for his work with action potentials in nerve fibers while on the faculty of Washington University in St. Louis , awarded jointly with Joseph Erlanger .  - Joseph Erlanger (January 5, 1874  December 5, 1965) was an American physiologist who is best known for his contributions to the field of neuroscience. Together with Herbert Spencer Gasser, he identified several varieties of nerve fiber and established the relationship between action potential velocity and fiber diameter. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1944 for these achievements.  - In physiology, an action potential is a short-lasting event in which the electrical membrane potential of a cell rapidly rises and falls, following a consistent trajectory. Action potentials occur in several types of animal cells, called excitable cells, which include neurons, muscle cells, and endocrine cells, as well as in some plant cells. In neurons, action potentials play a central role in cell-to-cell communication by providing for (or assisting in, with regard to saltatory conduction) the propagation of signals along the neuron's axon towards boutons at the axon ends which can then connect with other neurons at synapses, or to motor cells or glands. In other types of cells, their main function is to activate intracellular processes. In muscle cells, for example, an action potential is the first step in the chain of events leading to contraction. In beta cells of the pancreas, they provoke release of insulin. Action potentials in neurons are also known as \\"nerve impulses\\" or \\"spikes\\", and the temporal sequence of action potentials generated by a neuron is called its \\"spike train\\". A neuron that emits an action potential is often said to \\"fire\\".  - The Nobel Prize (; Swedish definite form, singular: \\"Nobelpriset\\") is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, and/or scientific advances.

The show finished its fifth season (1999-2000) 24th in the Nielsen ratings, the first time since season one that the show was not in the Top 20, with an average rating of 9.5, a decrease of 4% from the fourth season. This was a smaller drop than many other series experienced, given the erosion of network audiences. This was also a smaller drop than the previous season. The show's sixth season (2000-2001) finished 41st with an average rating of 8.23, a decrease of 13.4 percent from the fifth season.  ABC signed a new contract to keep the show on through a ninth season, even though the show had yet to enter its seventh season (2001-2002) at that time. The season saw one of the show's biggest drops in ratings, finishing 57th with an average rating of 5.9, a significant drop of 28.3% from the sixth season. The show finished its eighth season (2002-2003) season 119th with an average rating of 3.29, a drop of 44.23 percent from the seventh season. This caused ABC to put the series on hiatus, airing the rest of the season in the summer of 2003. Unable to get out of the contract, ABC was forced to allow the show to film a ninth season, paying three million dollars per episode. Not doing well enough to receive a time slot on ABC's fall schedule in 2003, the show had its ninth and final season burned off during the summer of 2004. The series finale was viewed by a little over 5 million viewers. Answer this question \\"Did the ratings fall during the 9th season and that's why the show didn't continue?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"Yes, the ratings did fall during the 9th season, which contributed to the show not continuing. The show struggled to perform well enough to receive a time slot on ABC's fall schedule in 2003, and its ninth and final season was eventually aired during the summer of 2004. The decline in ratings during the eighth season and the lackluster performance in the ninth season played a key role in the show's eventual discontinuation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Experts set threshold for climate-change calamity The world's leading climate scientists have for the first time established a limit on the amount of greenhouse gases that can be released before the Earth reaches a tipping point and predicted that it will be surpassed within decades unless swift action is taken to curb the current pace of emissions. The warning was issued Friday by a panel of U.N.-appointed climate change experts meeting in Stockholm. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that once a total of 1 trillion tons of carbon dioxide are emitted into atmosphere, the planet will exceed 3.6 degrees of warming, the internationally agreed-upon threshold to the worst effects of climate change. \\"We've burned through half that amount\\" since preindustrial times, Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University who reviewed the report and is a co-author of the panel's upcoming report on the effect of climate change, said in an interview. \\"Because the rates of emissions are growing, it looks like we could burn through the other half in the next 25 years\\" under one of the more dire scenarios outlined in the report. Other scenarios show that the threshold will be reached later this century. The finding constitutes a warning to governments to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, which is generated by the burning of fossil fuels, industrial activity and deforestation. Calling climate change \\"the greatest challenge of our time,\\" panel co-chair Thomas Stocker said humankind's fate in the next 100 years \\"depends crucially on how much carbon dioxide will be emitted in the future.\\" In the report, the panel said it is 95% certain that human activity is the dominant cause of the global warming observed since the 1950s. That is up from 90% six years ago. \\"Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, in global mean sea level rise, and in changes in some climate extremes,\\" the report said. The report is the panel's fifth major assessment since 1990. It reaffirms many of the conclusions of past reports, but with greater confidence. \\"The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased,\\" the panel wrote in a 36-page summary of its findings, released Friday. \\"Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850.\\" The panel's full 2,500-page report will be published Monday. The report also addressed the so-called hiatus, a slowdown in the rise of surface temperature that has been observed over the last 15 years. That slowing of the increase in temperatures has been seized on by skeptics to cast doubt on the science of climate change. The report touches the subject only briefly, saying that temperatures fluctuate naturally in the short term and \\"do not in general reflect long-term climate trends.\\" Brenda Ekwurzel, a climate scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the slowdown is more like a speed bump, a result of heat being trapped and circulated through the ocean and atmosphere in different ways rather than a fundamental change in the climate. She said surface temperature is just one of many expressions of climate change, including sea level rise, melting ice and ocean acidification. \\"The global average temperature is one kind of a thermometer, but an even bigger thermometer is the ocean, which is absorbing most of the excess heat that climate change is creating,\\" she said. The report updates predictions of how temperature and sea level are expected to rise over the century. The panel now expects sea level to rise globally by 10 inches to 32 inches by century's end, up from the rise of 7 inches to 23 inches it projected in 2007. Those figures now include the contribution of massive ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland that are creeping toward the ocean as they melt. The panel failed to account for that variable in its previous report, prompting criticism from the scientific community that its previous sea level rise projections were too low. The panel also lowered the bottom of the range of temperature increase expected over the long term if carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere double. The planet would warm by at least 2.7 degrees even if aggressive action is taken to cut emissions, but temperatures could rise as much as 8.1 degrees in other scenarios.","output":"Climate scientists have established a limit on the amount of greenhouse gases that can be released before the Earth reaches a tipping point. They predict that this limit will be surpassed within decades unless quick action is taken to reduce the current pace of emissions. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, once a total of 1 trillion tons of carbon dioxide are emitted, the planet will exceed 3.6 degrees of warming, which is the limit to avoid the worst effects of climate change.

Lead archaeologist Richard Buckley, from the University of Leicester, told a press conference to applause: \\"Beyond reasonable doubt it's Richard.\\" Richard, killed in battle in 1485, will be reinterred in Leicester Cathedral. Interactive: Twisted bones reveal a king Mr Buckley said the bones had been subjected to \\"rigorous academic study\\" and had been carbon dated to a period from 1455-1540. Dr Jo Appleby, an osteo-archaeologist from the university's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, revealed the bones were of a man in his late 20s or early 30s. Richard was 32 when he died. His skeleton had suffered 10 injuries, including eight to the skull, at around the time of death. Two of the skull wounds were potentially fatal. One was a \\"slice\\" removing a flap of bone, the other was caused by bladed weapon which went through and hit the opposite side of the skull - a depth of more than 10cm (4ins). Dr Appleby said: \\"Both of these injuries would have caused an almost instant loss of consciousness and death would have followed quickly afterwards. Source: BBC History The real Richard III - mad murderer or a man of his times? Testing Richard's bones - how does DNA analysis work? \\"In the case of the larger wound, if the blade had penetrated 7cm into the brain, which we cannot determine from the bones, death would have been instantaneous.\\" Other wounds included slashes or stabs to the face and the side of the head. There was also evidence of \\"humiliation\\" injuries, including a pelvic wound likely to have been caused by an upward thrust of a weapon, through the buttock. Richard III was portrayed as deformed by some Tudor historians and indeed the skeleton's spine is badly curved, a condition known as scoliosis. However, there was no trace of a withered arm or other abnormalities described in the more extreme characterisations of the king. Without the scoliosis, which experts believe developed during teenage years, he would have been about 5ft 8ins (1.7m) tall, but the curvature would have made him appear \\"considerably\\" shorter. Dr Appleby said: \\"The analysis of the skeleton proved that it was an adult male but was an unusually slender, almost feminine, build for a man. \\"Taken as a whole, the skeletal evidence provides a highly convincing case for identification as Richard III.\\" Richard was a royal prince until the death of his brother Edward IV in 1483. Appointed as protector of his nephew, Edward V, Richard instead assumed the reins of power. Edward and his brother Richard, known as the Princes in the Tower, disappeared soon after. Rumours circulated they had been murdered on the orders of their uncle. Challenged by Henry Tudor, Richard was killed at Bosworth in 1485 after only two years on the throne. He was given a hurried burial beneath the church of Greyfriars in the centre of Leicester. Mr Buckley said the grave was clumsily cut, with sloping sides and too short for the body, forcing the head forward. • Wealth of evidence, including radiocarbon dating, radiological evidence, DNA and bone analysis and archaeological results, confirms identity of last Plantagenet king who died over 500 years ago • DNA from skeleton matches two of Richard III's maternal line relatives. Leicester genealogist verifies living relatives of Richard III's family • Individual likely to have been killed by one of two fatal injuries to the skull - one possibly from a sword and one possibly from a halberd • Ten wounds discovered on skeleton - Richard III killed by trauma to the back of the head. Part of the skull sliced off • Radiocarbon dating reveals individual had a high protein diet - including significant amounts of seafood - meaning he was likely to be of high status • Radiocarbon dating reveals individual died in the second half of the 15th or in the early 16th Century - consistent with Richard's death in 1485 • Skeleton reveals severe scoliosis - onset believed to have occurred at the time of puberty • Although about 5ft 8in tall (1.7m), the condition meant King Richard III would have stood significantly shorter and his right shoulder may have been higher than the left • Feet were truncated at an unknown point in the past, but a significant time after the burial \\"There was no evidence of a coffin or shroud which would have left the bones in a more compact position. \\"Unusually, the arms are crossed and this could be an indication the body was buried with the wrists still tied,\\" he added. Greyfriars church was demolished during the Reformation in the 16th Century and over the following centuries its exact location was forgotten. However, a team of enthusiasts and historians managed to trace the likely area - and, crucially, after painstaking genealogical research, they found a 17th-generation descendant of Richard's sister with whose DNA they could compare any remains. Joy Ibsen, from Canada, died several years ago but her son, Michael, who now works in London, provided a sample. The researchers were fortunate as, while the DNA they were looking for was in all Joy Ibsen's offspring, it is only handed down through the female line and her only daughter has no children. The line was about to stop. But the University of Leicester's experts had other problems. Dr Turi King, project geneticist, said there had been concern DNA in the bones would be too degraded: \\"The question was could we get a sample of DNA to work with, and I am extremely pleased to tell you that we could.\\" She added: \\"There is a DNA match between the maternal DNA of the descendants of the family of Richard III and the skeletal remains we found at the Greyfriars dig. \\"In short, the DNA evidence points to these being the remains of Richard III.\\" In August 2012, an excavation began in a city council car park - the only open space remaining in the likely area - which quickly identified buildings connected to the church. The bones were found in the first days of the dig and were eventually excavated under forensic conditions. Details of the reburial ceremony have yet to be released, but Philippa Langley from the Richard III Society said plans for a tomb were well advanced. She said of the discovery of Richard's skeleton: \\"I'm totally thrilled, I'm overwhelmed to be honest, it's been a long hard journey. I mean today as we stand it's been nearly four years. \\"It's the culmination of a lot of hard work. I think, as someone said to me earlier, it's just the end of the beginning. \\"We're going to completely reassess Richard III, we're going to completely look at all the sources again, and hopefully there's going to be a new beginning for Richard as well.\\"","output":"A group of experts found some old bones that belonged to a very important king named Richard III. They made sure by comparing the bones' DNA with the DNA of people who are related to Richard's family. Richard III was a king a long time ago, and he died in a big battle. The scientists found out that he had many injuries on his head and other parts of his body. They also figured out that his back was curved, making him look shorter than he was. These findings help us learn more about this king and his life. They plan to give him a special resting place in a place called Leicester Cathedral."},{"instruction":"Q:What key details about jerome davis -lrb- offensive tackle -rrb-  can be extracted from the following bio?

The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan (Ralph Morgan) after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's named Dr. Bizet arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance (Maxine Doyle) is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer.

Background: Zorro (Spanish for \\"fox\\") is a fictional character created in 1919 by American pulp writer Johnston McCulley, and appearing in works set in the Pueblo of Los Angeles during the era of Spanish California (1769-1821). He is typically portrayed as a dashing masked vigilante who defends the commoners and indigenous peoples of California against corrupt and tyrannical officials and other villains. His signature all-black costume includes a cape, a hat known as sombrero cordobes, and a domino mask that covers the upper part of his face. In the stories, Zorro has a high bounty on his head, but is too skilled and cunning for the bumbling authorities to catch, and he also delights in publicly humiliating them. Context: In The Curse of Capistrano, Senor Zorro became an outlaw in the pueblo of Los Angeles in California \\"to avenge the helpless, to punish cruel politicians, to aid the oppressed.\\" He is the title character, as he is dubbed the \\"Curse of Capistrano\\". The novel features extensively both Don Diego Vega and Zorro, but the fact that they are the same person is not revealed to the reader until the end of the book. In the story, both Diego and Zorro romance Lolita Pulido, an impoverished noblewoman. While Lolita is unimpressed with Diego, who pretends to be a passionless fop, she is attracted to the dashing Zorro. The main villain is Captain Ramon, who also has his eyes on Lolita. Other characters include Sgt. Pedro Gonzales, Zorro's enemy but Diego's friend; Diego's deaf and mute servant Bernardo; his ally, Fray (Friar) Felipe; his father Don Alejandro Vega, the richest landowner in California and a widower; Don Carlos Pulido and his wife, Dona Catalina, Lolita's parents; and a group of noblemen (caballeros) who, at first, hunt Zorro but are then won over to his cause.  In later stories, McCulley introduces characters such as pirates and Native Americans, some of whom know Zorro's identity.  In McCulley's later stories, Diego's surname became de la Vega. In fact, the writer was wildly inconsistent. The first magazine serial ended with the villain dead and Diego publicly exposed as Zorro. But in the sequel, the villain was alive and the next entry had the double identity still secret.  Several Zorro productions have expanded on the character's exploits. Many of the continuations feature a younger character taking up the mantle of Zorro.  McCulley's stories are set during the during the era of Spanish California (1769-1821) and, although exact years are often vague, the presence of the Pueblo of Los Angeles means the stories cannot happen before 1781, the year it was founded. Some media adaptations of Zorro's story have placed him during the later era of Mexican California (1821-1846).  The character's visual motif is typically a black costume with a black flowing Spanish cape or cloak, a black flat-brimmed hat known as sombrero cordobes, and a black sackcloth mask that covers the top of the head from eye level upwards. Sometimes the mask is a two piece, the main item being a blindfold-type fabric with slits for the eyes, and the other item being a bandana over the head, so that it is covered even if the hat is removed: this is the mask worn in the movie The Mark of Zorro (1920) and in the television series Zorro (1957-1959). Other times, the mask is a one piece that unites both items described above: this mask was introduced in The Mark of Zorro (1940) and appears in many modern versions. Zorro's mask has also occasionally been shown as being a rounded domino mask, which he wore without also wearing a bandana. In his first appearance, Zorro's cloak is purple, his hat is generically referred to as a \\"wide sombrero,\\" and his black cloth veil mask with slits for eyes covers his whole face. Other features of the costume may vary.  His favored weapon is a rapier, which he also uses to often leave his distinctive mark, a Z cut with three quick strokes, on his defeated foes and other objects. He also uses other weapons, including a bullwhip and a pistol.  The fox is never depicted as Zorro's emblem. It is used as a metaphor for the character's wiliness, such as in the lyrics \\"Zorro, 'the Fox', so cunning and free ...\\" from the Disney television show theme.  His heroic pose consists of rearing on his horse Tornado, often saluting with his hand or raising his sword high. The logo of the company Zorro Productions, Inc. uses an image of Zorro rearing on his horse, sword raised high.  Zorro is an agile athlete and acrobat, using his bullwhip as a gymnastic accoutrement to swing through gaps between city roofs, and is very capable of landing from great heights and taking a fall. Although he is a master swordsman and marksman, he has more than once demonstrated his prowess in unarmed combat against multiple opponents.  His calculating and precise dexterity as a tactician has enabled him to use his two main weapons, his sword and bullwhip, as an extension of his deft hand. He never uses brute strength. Instead and more likely, he uses his fox-like and sly mind, and well-practiced technique to outmatch an opponent.  In some versions, Zorro keeps a medium-sized dagger tucked in his left boot for emergencies. He has used his cape as a blind, a trip-mat and a disarming tool. Zorro's boots are also sometimes weighted, as is his hat, which he has thrown, Frisbee-style, as an efficiently substantial warning to enemies. But more often than not, he uses psychological mockery to make his opponents too angry to be coordinated in combat.  Zorro is a skilled horseman. The name of his jet-black horse has varied through the years. In The Curse of Capistrano, it was unnamed. In Disney's Zorro television series the horse gets the name Tornado, which has been kept in many later adaptations. In most versions, Zorro keeps Tornado in a secret cave, connected to his hacienda with a system of secret passages and underground tunnels.  McCulley's concept of a band of men helping Zorro is often absent from other versions of the character. An exception is Zorro's Fighting Legion (1939), starring Reed Hadley as Diego. In Douglas Fairbanks' version, he also has a band of masked men helping him. In McCulley's stories, Zorro was aided by a deaf-mute named Bernardo. In Disney's Zorro television series, Bernardo is not deaf but pretends to be, and serves as Zorro's secret agent. He is a capable and invaluable helper for Zorro, sometimes wearing the mask to reinforce his master's charade. The Family Channel's Zorro television series replaces Bernardo with a teenager named Felipe, played by Juan Diego Botto, with a similar disability and pretense. Question: what were some resources he used? Answer:","output":"Some resources that Zorro used include: 1. His costume: Zorro's all-black costume with a cape, sombrero cordobes, and domino mask helped him maintain his secret identity and strike fear in the hearts of his enemies. 2. Weapons: Zorro was skilled with a variety of weapons, including a rapier, bullwhip, and pistol. He used these to disarm, disable, and defeat his adversaries while leaving his trademark \\"Z\\" mark on them. 3. Acrobatics and agility: Zorro's athletic abilities and acrobatic skills allowed him to navigate difficult terrain, evade capture, and outmaneuver his foes. 4. His horse: Zorro's jet-black horse, often named Tornado, was a key resource for him. The horse was not only fast and reliable, but also helped Zorro make a quick escape when needed. 5. Secret hideout: In most versions, Zorro kept Tornado in a secret cave, connected to his hacienda via a system of secret passages and underground tunnels. This allowed him to change into his costume, access his weapons, and formulate his plans away from prying eyes. 6. Allies: Zorro was occasionally aided by a group of men or individuals such as Bernardo, Felipe, or Fray Felipe, who helped him gather information, maintain his secret identity, and fight against the corrupt officials and other villains. 7. Psychological tactics: Zorro often used psychological warfare to provoke, confuse, and intimidate his enemies, making them lose focus and giving him an advantage in combat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What was the Latin expression which John Keating summarized to his students? Movie title: Dead Poets Society Movie plot: New England, the late 1950s. Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), a lonely and painfully shy teenager, who is under pressure by his stern parents because he must live up to his older brother's reputation to attend Yale and become a lawyer, arrives for the new semester at the Welton Academy for boys -- Todd's brother also attended Welton and was a popular and well-regarded student there. This semester begins during an orientation gathering with a speech given by the stern Headmaster Nolan (Norman Lloyd), who states the academy's four pillars: Tradition, Honor, Discipline, and Excellence. Todd meets Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) an ambitious student whom becomes his dorm roommate.Later in his dorm, Neil is ordered by his grumpy and domineering father (Kurtwood Smith) to drop his involvement with the school annual in order to maintain good grades so the boy may become a doctor much as he has done. Neil is under pressure from his stern father's will. Also, Mr. Perry tells Neil that Mrs. Perry also wants him to become a doctor, which further worries the boy. A little later, Todd tells Neil that he is in a similar situation with his parents involving his older brother who also attended Welton a few years ago, graduated, and attended Yale Law School and became a lawyer and his parents want the exact same thing for him.

Answer this question: where does the last name mann come from??","output":"The surname \\"Mann\\" has roots in multiple cultures and countries, and thus its origin varies depending on the context. Here's a detailed look at the etymology and history of this surname. 1. British Origin:  In the context of British origins, the surname Mann is derived from the pre-7th century Old English word 'mann' which usually meant 'man', but could also refer to a person of mixed gender, a servant, or a vassal. The name was predominantly used as a nickname or an occupational name, perhaps designating a servant or someone considered of lesser status. It's important to note that British surnames became hereditary fairly late in history, so the surname \\"Mann\\" could have been given to a countless number of unrelated people across the British Isles who had some connection to the basic descriptors mentioned above. For instance, many individual servants, vassals or workers may have been nicknamed 'mann' and seen this title evolve into a surname over time. 2. German Origin: In German, the word 'Mann' also means 'man'. During the Middle Ages, it became a common practice to use nicknames as a last name, usually related to a person's characteristics or features, or their occupation or location. So, someone who was manly, brave, or perhaps simply an adult male, could acquire the surname Mann. It's worth noting that the name could also have served as a reduced form of compounds such as Hermann. Furthermore, many Jewish families took on the surname Mann in the 18th and 19th centuries, often for the simple reason that it indicated manhood or maturity.  3. Dutch Origin: In Dutch, the name is derived from the Middle Dutch word 'man' which means 'man'. It was most often used as a nickname or occupational name. Sometimes, the surname Mann may have been a patronymic surname derived from the first name of the father.  It is important to keep in mind that regions and borders shifted over time, and with these shifts, the surname Mann may have moved and evolved. 4. Norwegian Origin: In Norway, the surname Mann can also have topographic origins. People there were often given names associated with the geographical features of their landholdings. In this context, Mann could be related to a place recognized for an important man or a group of men. 5. Jewish Origin: In Ashkenazi Jewish communities, the surname can be an acronym of the Hebrew phrase 'Moreinu ha-Rav', which means ‘our teacher the rabbi’. In summary, being a common noun in the Germanic languages, the surname 'Mann' has independently originated multiple times across Northern Europe and is, therefore, of polygenetic origin. Each instance of the surname's creation most likely had distinct circumstances, and the name could connote different meanings depending on those circumstances. Therefore, tracing a single line of origin for this surname can be a challenging task, and a person bearing this surname could have ancestors from many different regions or cultures."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Emperor of the North Movie plot: Shack is a merciless, inhumane, and sadistic bully of a railroad conductor who takes it upon himself to ensure that no one would ever ride on his train for free, and that anyone who has would no longer live. Shack has an arsenal of makeshift weapons: a hammer, a steel rod, and a chain. A hobo who is a hero to his peers, A-No.1, manages to hop the train with the younger, less-experienced Cigaret close behind. At the next stop, A-No.1 evades Shack and escapes into the hobo jungle, but Cigaret is caught. Shack threatens to kill Cigaret for riding his train for free, who is bragging that he and he alone did it. Shack is distracted when he learns that A-No.1 has posted a notice on the yard water tower, announcing that he will become the first hobo to ride Shack's train all the way to Portland. The other hobos agree that the first who can successfully ride Shack's train will have earned the title \\"Emperor of the North Pole.\\" Railroad workers place bets whether A-No.-1 can do it, spreading the news far and wide over the telegraph, Shack being widely known and disliked. A-No.1 hops the train and does everything he can to steer clear of Shack, pulling a series of pranks with the help of other hobos, such as running Shack's train into a siding and greasing the tracks, almost causing it to crash head on into an oncoming mail train. He tries to rid himself of the company of Cigaret, who tags along and makes a general pest of himself. Shack succeeds in ejecting the two, but they board a fast passenger train which overtakes Shack's train and ride it to Salem, Oregon.

What was the name of the painting that was completed in 1896 and presented to Patriarch Gerogije later that year?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Seoba Srba (English: Migration of the Serbs) is a set of four similar oil paintings by the Serbian artist Paja Jovanović that depict Serbs, led by Archbishop Arsenije III, fleeing Old Serbia during the Great Serb Migration of 1690–91. The first was commissioned in 1895 by Georgije Branković, the Patriarch of Karlovci, to be displayed at the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition. In the view of the Serbian clergy, it would serve to legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self-administration in Austria-Hungary by upholding the contention that Serbs left their homeland at the behest of the Holy Roman Emperor to protect the Habsburg Monarchy's borders. Measuring 380 by 580 centimetres (150 by 230 in), the first painting was completed in 1896, and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year. Dissatisfied, the Patriarch asked Jovanović to adjust his work to conform with the Church's view of the migration. Though Jovanović made the changes relatively quickly, he could not render them in time for the painting to be displayed in Budapest, and it therefore had to be unveiled at the Archbishop's palace in Sremski Karlovci. Jovanović went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting, three of which survive. The first version is on display at the patriarchate building of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, the second at the Pančevo Museum, and the fourth at Princess Ljubica's Residence, in Belgrade. Migration of the Serbs holds iconic status in Serbian popular culture, and several authors repute it to be one of Jovanović's finest achievements.

I read this background article the other day: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

If fewer people recycle, the amount of recyclable materials going to recycling centers will decrease. Consequently, the recycling centers may struggle to maintain their operations, leading to closures, reduction in workforce, or less investment in recycling technologies. This could then lead to manufacturers having less access to the recycled materials they need and may force them to rely more on new, non-recycled materials that might be more expensive or less environmentally friendly. Ultimately, this could result in a negative impact on the environment, as more waste ends up in landfills and natural resources may be further depleted for the creation of new materials. Furthermore, the reduction in recycling could indirectly affect public awareness and attitudes towards recycling, potentially further decreasing the number of people who take part in recycling.

Article: A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  Paragraph: Jessica and Milly are two politicians currently in the running for governor of their city. They are in the process of having a debate that is being broadcast on local television. Mike, an avid environmentalist who is trying to decide who to vote for, has been watching the entire debate. He feels the most important issue when voting is saving the planet and the animals on it. The question that was just asked by the moderator was \\"what do you think should be done with the Earth's atmosphere?\\" Jessica responds that she thinks we should emit more anthropogenic gases. She believes that will lead to the best outcome for the world. Milly states that we need to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will the number of animals increase or decrease under Milly's plan? The answer to this question is:","output":"The number of animals is likely to increase under Milly's plan. By advocating for a decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, Milly's plan aims to mitigate the effects of global warming and climate change. This would help protect natural habitats and ecosystems, which in turn would support the conservation of wildlife populations and potentially lead to an increase in the number of animals."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: Given the below context:  Chinese imperial tombs are typically  approached by a \\"spirit road\\", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals. A  tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of Bixi in the form of a tortoise, is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of \\"lions\\" and \\"chimeras\\"; in later periods they are much more varied.  A looted tomb with fine paintings is the Empress Dowager Wenming tomb of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century Tang dynasty Qianling Mausoleum group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.The complex of Goguryeo Tombs, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern Korea, are especially rich in paintings.  Only one of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties has been excavated, in 1956, with such disastrous results for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of Jiaxiang County, Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones.  The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period.  A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing.  After the introduction of Buddhism, carved \\"funerary couches\\" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious.

But Johnny Sexton's late penalty spoiled what could have been a good day for Wales. \\"I'm not satisfied at all - I'm feeling pretty flat at the moment,\\" said Gatland. \\"It's disappointing that you've played one game and even though it's not a loss you've taken a couple of trophies out of the cabinet already. \\"You can't win the Triple Crown and you can't win the Grand Slam so that's disappointing.\\" Wales took the lead for the first time in the 72nd minute when substitute fly-half Rhys Priestland - on for the injured Dan Biggar - kicked his third penalty to make the score 16-13. But a miscued clearance kick by another replacement - scrum-half Lloyd Williams - led to a Welsh infringement which saw Sexton fire over his third penalty to draw Ireland level. \\"We didn't start well, but got ourselves back in the game, dominated territory and possession,\\" Gatland said. \\"And then to get in front and obviously not execute an exit play accurately enough was disappointing. \\"We possibly should have come away with a win but maybe a draw was a fair reflection of the game.\\" Wales, who name their team to play Scotland next weekend on Wednesday, will have to wait to know the extent of Biggar's injury. The Scots are coming off the back of their Calcutta Cup defeat against England and seeking a first win in Cardiff since 2002.

Gatland said: \\"Gareth's hamstring was tight on Friday so he pulled out of training on Friday so Liam ran at full-back in training and flew over with us. \\"Gareth did the captain's run and came through that, but the tightness was still there so the medical decision was made Saturday night that it wasn't worth the risk of starting with Gareth particularly as we didn't have a huge amount of full-back cover and one of our 10s was going to have to go back there.\\" Gatland added the risk of aggravating or causing further injury was also a factor in leaving Anscombe out, saying a hamstring tear would have been \\"a six week injury\\".

Both The Rookie and Ghostopolis demonstrate how visual storytelling mediums, such as graphic novels, have the power to enhance a reader's experience by providing a more immersive way to convey narrative, character development, and emotions. By presenting the story through text and images together, these visual storytelling mediums create a richer and more engaging experience for the reader. In conclusion, The Rookie and Ghostopolis showcase the potential of visual storytelling to transport readers into imagined worlds effectively.

She was alive after she was shot and was carried downstairs by Pistorius, said the official, who was not authorized to release details to the media. A blood-stained cricket bat has also emerged as key evidence in the case, according to the City Press newspaper of Johannesburg. Detectives are working to determine whether the bat was used to attack Steenkamp or she used it in self-defense, the newspaper reported, citing a source with inside knowledge of the case. Detectives are also looking into the possibility that Pistorius used the bat to break down the bathroom door. The details are the latest to emerge in the shooting death that has roiled the nation and left South Africans asking what went so terribly wrong inside the upscale Pretoria home of the man nicknamed \\"Blade Runner\\" for his lightning-fast prosthetic legs. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were indications the 29-year-old model intended to stay the night at the house: She had an overnight bag and her iPad. Opinion: Pistorius case and the plague of violence against women Authorities have released little about a possible motive in the Valentine's Day shooting, while local media have reported that Pistorius had mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder. South African authorities have stressed that the scenario did not come from them, and said there was no evidence of forced entry at the home. Police have charged Pistorius with murder, and he will appear in court Tuesday for a bail hearing. South African prosecutors have said they intend to upgrade the charge to premeditated murder, but have not released further details. Pistorius, 26, has rejected the murder allegation \\"in the strongest terms,\\" his agent said in a statement. Nike's bullet ad with Pistorius backfires The same day Pistorius returns to court, Steenkamp will be buried in a private service in her hometown of Port Elizabeth. Her burial Tuesday will come two days after South Africa's national broadcaster aired a pre-recorded reality TV show featuring Steenkamp discussing her exit from \\"Tropika Island of Treasure,\\" on which local celebrities compete for prize money. The decision to air the program took \\"much deliberation,\\" and \\"this week's episode will be dedicated to Reeva's memory,\\" said Samantha Moon, the executive producer. The shooting has stunned South Africa, where Pistorius is a national hero as the first disabled athlete to compete in the able-bodied Olympic Games. He competed in the London Games as well as winning two gold medals in the Paralympic Games. Headlines about the case have dominated in the days since Pistorius was arrested, though tight-lipped authorities have revealed little about what, if anything, the track star has said.

Neighbors alerted authorities to the early morning shooting, saying they had \\"heard things earlier,\\" police spokeswoman Denise Beukes has said.

Pictures of his walk to a police car, his head covered by a sweatshirt, have flashed repeatedly across television screens. On Sunday, Pistorius canceled his appearances in five upcoming races.

The Original Wolf of Wall Street Carl Icahn Returns By Rana Foroohar Monday, Dec. 16, 2013 Carl Icahn is the richest man on Wall Street. He's the most feared corporate raider In the world. He may also be the most entertaining financier on the planet. Having grown up in a family that resembled a darker version of Woody Allen's multigenerational working-class Jewish clan in Radio Days, Icahn is prone to one-liners. His real talent is as a mimic, but when I ask him to do Apple CEO Tim Cook, he declines. \\"Nah, I can't do Cook. I can only do crazies.\\" Of course, some people say Cook is crazy to listen to Icahn, who has been trying to persuade him since August to give some of Apple's 147 billion cash hoard back to investors in the form of a massive share buyback. Now Icahn is ratcheting up the pressure: he tells TIME that he filed a precatory proposal with Apple on Nov. 26, three days before the deadline for measures to be voted on at the company's next annual shareholders meeting. His proposal, which calls for a stock buyback, would not be binding on the company's management, and that's typical for shareholder resolutions. But a buyback would almost certainly push up the price of Apple's stock--and increase the value of Icahn's 2 billion in Apple holdings along with those of all the other Apple investors. Icahn says he doesn't consider his proposal an indictment of Cook, who has been at Apple's helm since Steve Jobs died in 2011. \\"Tim Cook is doing a good job with the business,\\" Icahn tells TIME. \\"I think he's good at running the business whether he does what I want or not. But Apple is not a bank.\\" Get TIME the way you want it Learn more about the benefits of being a TIME subscriber If you are already a subscriber sign up — registration is free!

We all talk a fair game about what needs to be on your resume, but there’s also plenty of stuff that should be removed. The fluff. The blabber. The full-on oddities. And even some of the details you think are important. Here’s the thing: If you want a shot at grabbing your target audience and showing them what you’re made of, every section of your resume needs to be thoughtfully constructed, and every word carefully placed. So, let’s all get out our big red markers; we’re going to start marking that baby up. Here are seven things that you absolutely must drop-kick from your resume. The vast majority of objectives say nothing. Oh, so you’re seeking a challenging position with a growing corporation that will allow you to make a positive contribution, are you? How groundbreaking. Craft an executive summary or “Who I Am” section that showcases your overarching value proposition (or, as I call it, your “So what?”) and speaks directly to the stuff you know the target audience is going to care the most about. This is your chance to make it clear you’re a strong fit. Do you practice witchcraft, preside over your local gun club, or spend endless hours practicing your extraordinary mime routine? Terrific. But unless you are applying for jobs that will specifically value these interests (or they’re flat-out amazing conversation starters), leave them off. Decision makers will judge the heck out of you if they spot hobbies that fly in the face of their own personal beliefs or seem odd. Include interests only if you feel they support your overall professional message and brand. If you’re a dietician who maintains a recipe blog for fun, yes. If you’re an accountant who enjoys photographing people’s feet, absolutely not. The fastest way to sound like a pompous goof is to construct your resume in the third person—à la “John raised more than 70,000 for the organization.” Every single time I read a resume in which the author does this, all I can think of is someone sitting around in a smoking jacket, with a pipe, pontificating on and on about himself. Don’t do it. When you write a resume, your name and contact information are at the top of the page. For this reason alone, the receiver will most assuredly deduce that the document he or she is receiving was, indeed, from you. So write the resume in the first person, minus the pronouns (e.g., “Raised more than 70,000”). Nothing says, “I job search on company time” quite like using your current work email address on a resume. Unless you own the company, it’s poor form to run your job search through your company’s email system. Easy–use your personal email for all job search business. And, ideally, your own time. Why “utilize” when you can “use?” Why “append” when you can “add?” It’s not “analogous;” it’s really just “similar.” Using non-conversational words doesn’t make you look smart; it makes you look like someone who spends too much time in a thesaurus. Run the “would I ever say this in real life?” test on every phrase and sentence in your resume. If you find words or statements that don’t read like something you’d say? Change ’em up. Your resume is not an autobiography of every job you’ve held since you graduated; it’s a marketing document. So, unless something you did more than 12-15 years ago is vital for your target audience to know about, you don’t need to list the entry-level job or internship you held in 1994. It’s totally OK to leave some of the life history off. For each former job, think about what you did or achieved that will be required (or will hold significant value) in your next role. Showcase only that stuff. If your first job out of college does nothing to support this overall message? It’s probably not needed. If you’d like me to, I’ll launch into the story about the field engineer I worked with who was this close to landing a great job—until the employer conducted a degree verification and discovered that, while he’d taken courses at that university, he didn’t graduate. The kicker? He didn’t even need a degree to qualify for that job. But because he got caught in a lie, he didn’t get it. Strategize. (In this case, I would have suggested that this engineer load his education section with professional development courses and certifications, which would have made an equally great impact.) Whatever you do, do not lie. Editing a resume can be tough. People tend to be quite attached to the things they’ve done or accomplished professionally, and passionate about their outside interests. But the bottom line is this: You need to have everything working for you on your resume. Be brutally objective, cut the fat, and for goodness’ sake, leave off all details of your vast collection of clown figures. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"When crafting your resume, it's essential to focus on what really matters to make a strong impression. Here are seven things to remove from your resume: 1. Generic objectives: Replace them with an executive summary that highlights your unique value proposition. 2. Controversial or unrelated hobbies: Include interests only if they support your professional message or brand. 3. Third-person narratives: Write the resume in the first person without pronouns. 4. Your work email address: Use a personal email for job search business to avoid appearing unprofessional. 5. Overly complex language: Stick to conversational words that are easy to understand. 6. Irrelevant job experiences: Focus on the jobs and achievements that are relevant and valuable for the position you're applying for. 7. False information: Never lie on your resume, as it can cost you a job opportunity and damage your reputation. Instead, strategize and focus on your strengths."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Movie title: Killers from Space Movie plot: Dr. Douglas Martin (Peter Graves) is a nuclear scientist working on atomic bomb tests. While collecting aerial data on a United States Air Force (USAF) atomic blast at Soledad Flats, he loses control of his aircraft and crashes. He appears to have survived, unhurt, walking back to the air base with no memory of what happened. On his chest is a strange scar that was not there before the crash. At the base hospital, Martin acts so strangely that the USAF brings in the FBI to investigate, thinking he might be an impostor. He is eventually cleared but told to take some time off. Martin protests being excluded from his project while on leave. When an atomic test is set off without his knowledge, Martin steals the data, then goes back to Soledad Flats and places the information under a stone. An FBI agent follows him, but Martin is able to elude him until he crashes his car. Now back at the hospital, he is given truth serum. Deep under the drug's influence, Martin tells a story about being held captive, by space aliens in their underground base., The aliens, with large, bulging eyes, are from the planet Astron Delta. They had revived his lifeless body as he had died in his aircraft. The aliens plan to exterminate humanity using giant insects and reptiles, grown with the radiation absorbed from our own atomic bomb tests. Martin intuits that the aliens use stolen electric grid power to control their powerful equipment. This so that the A-bomb's released energy levels can be predicted and then balanced. The aliens wiped his memory and hypnotized him into collecting the data for them. The FBI agent (Steve Pendleton) and the base commander (James Seay) are skeptical of this incredible story and keep him confined at the hospital. Nevertheless, the attending physician says that Martin genuinely believes that what he told them is true. With calculations made with a slide rule, Martin determines that if he shuts off the power to Soledad Flats for just 10 seconds, it will create an overload in the aliens' equipment. So he...

Scott Stevens, the Idaho meteorologist who claimed that a weather manipulating conspiracy (possibly under the control of Japanese Yakuza mafia) caused Hurricane Katrina, has quit his job at KPVI-TV in Pocatello. Can we infer the following? Scott believed the mafia was involved with the hurricane.","output":"Yes, based on the information provided, we can infer that Scott Stevens, a meteorologist from Idaho, believed that there was a weather manipulating conspiracy in relation to Hurricane Katrina. He claimed that it was possibly under the control of the Japanese Yakuza mafia, hence implicating their involvement with the hurricane. Scott Stevens worked as a meteorologist at KPVI-TV in Pocatello, Idaho. His claims about the weather manipulating conspiracy indicate that he held unconventional beliefs about the cause of the catastrophic weather event known as Hurricane Katrina. Hurricane Katrina was a Category 5 storm that devastated the Gulf Coast of the United States, particularly affecting Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, in August 2005. It caused widespread destruction, death, and displacement and is considered one of the most destructive hurricanes in United States history. It is important to note that Scott Stevens' belief in a conspiracy involving the Japanese Yakuza mafia and Hurricane Katrina is not supported by scientific evidence or widely accepted meteorological studies. The general consensus among scientists and meteorologists is that hurricanes, including Hurricane Katrina, form as a result of natural processes influenced by atmospheric temperature, ocean temperature, wind patterns, and other factors. The concept of weather manipulation does exist in the realm of scientific research. It mainly refers to cloud seeding, which alters the amount or type of precipitation that falls from clouds, or geoengineering, which is the large-scale intervention in the Earth's climatic system to counteract climate change. However, there is no clear evidence to support the idea that weather manipulation to the extent of creating or steering destructive hurricanes like Katrina is currently possible, let alone that it was perpetrated by an organized crime group like the Japanese Yakuza mafia. Given Scott Stevens' unconventional beliefs, which were not backed by scientific evidence, it is understandable that his claims led to him stepping down from his position as a meteorologist at KPVI-TV. While we can infer that Stevens believed the mafia had a role in manipulating Hurricane Katrina based on the information given, it is crucial to recognize that this belief is not consistent with established scientific understanding and should not be treated as a widely accepted explanation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Richard Nixon Presidential Library will allow access Tuesday to about 154 hours of Nixon White House tape recordings and 30,000 pages of documents that were formerly classified. President Nixon announces the U.S. incursion into Cambodia during the Vietnam War in April 1970. Among the tapes and documents are conversations about the Vietnam War, Nixon's second inauguration, the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 and the first Watergate trial, according to a library statement. Tuesday's release is the 13th opening of Nixon White House tapes since 1980, the statement said. The new Nixon tapes and documents will be available on the Internet and in the Richard Nixon libraries in College Park, Maryland, and Yorba Linda, California. Nixon resigned August 9, 1974, over the Watergate scandal -- the first president to resign from office. President Ford pardoned Nixon the following month, saying it was necessary for the nation to heal after Watergate. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The Richard Nixon Presidential Library is set to provide access to roughly 154 hours of White House tape recordings and 30,000 pages of formerly classified documents. This event marks a monumental contribution towards the understanding of Nixon's presidency, and U.S. history in general, as it opens more material for scholarly and public investigation.  These materials include discussions about pivotal events and decisions during Nixon's tenure. One such discussion pertains to the U.S. incursion into Cambodia during the Vietnam War, which was announced by Nixon himself in April 1970. The decisions and eventual outcomes of this particular incursion hold significant weight in the history of United States foreign affairs, giving researchers and historians an enlightening perspective on this era. The announcement also includes mentions of conversations touching on Nixon's second inauguration. As inauguration is an integral event in a President's term, these potential insights could provide a revealing look into the administrative and political landscape at the time, and the strategy involved in planning such an event. The collection includes dialogues related to milestone court decisions such as the Supreme Court's verdict on Roe v. Wade in 1973. This landmark judgement, which legally protected a woman's rights to abortion services, substantially transformed the landscape of reproductive rights in the U.S. These documents can give us a better grasp of the administration's position and its influence on such transformative judicial decisions. It becomes more intriguing when we learn that the materials provide data on the first Watergate trial, a scandal that is indelibly etched in U.S. history. President Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, following the Watergate scandal, making him the first U.S. president to resign from the office. His successor, President Ford, later pardoned Nixon in an effort to mend the national rift that Watergate caused. The released materials are part of the 13th opening of Nixon White House tapes since 1980. The access to such extensive primary source materials invariably enriches our understanding of the controversial yet influential presidency of Richard Nixon. The newly available Nixon tapes and documents can be accessed both online and at the Richard Nixon libraries in College Park, Maryland and Yorba Linda, California. Providing a more detailed account of the presidential life, actions, and decisions of Nixon, these materials will help historians, scholars, and the public alike to better contextualize Nixon's administration within the broader panorama of American history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: One reason radiation is dangerous is that it can’t be detected with the senses. You normally can’t see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure below , has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below.  Paragraph: Robert and Thomas are visiting an abandoned amusement park in Russia that is rumored to emit radiation due to the materials used in the rides.  Robert visits the Ferris wheel and his Geiger counter clicks slowly. Thomas visits the merry go round and his Geiger counter begins to click rapidly.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person's Geiger count has less current running through it? Answer:","output":"In the given paragraph, Robert's Geiger counter clicks slowly, while Thomas's Geiger counter clicks rapidly.  Step 1: Understand the relationship between the speed of clicks and the level of radiation The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. Step 2: Compare the speed of clicks for both Geiger counters Robert's Geiger counter clicks slowly, indicating a lower level of radiation.  Thomas's Geiger counter clicks rapidly, indicating a higher level of radiation.  Step 3: Determine which Geiger counter has less current running through it Since a lower level of radiation corresponds to a lesser amount of current, Robert's Geiger counter has less current running through it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Start by understanding the structure and meaning of the sentence as a whole. The sentence describes a scene where a group of players gather in a close group (a huddle) before a sporting event (the match). Step by step, I will extract the most important words to convey the main idea of the sentence. 2. Identify the main subject and verb. The main subject is \\"players\\" and the main verb is \\"form.\\" These are key in understanding the sentence, as they provide the primary action and participants. 3. Identify any direct objects or important prepositional phrases. The direct object associated with the verb \\"form\\" is \\"a huddle.\\" This describes the specific action the players are taking. Additionally, the prepositional phrase \\"prior to day of the match\\" provides contextual information about when the action occurs.  4. Consider any auxiliary words that support the meaning of the main verb, subject, and phrases. The word \\"prior\\" within the prepositional phrase \\"prior to day of the match\\" emphasizes the timing of the action and is important to understand when it is happening. 5.

An analysis of each component of the phrase reveals that it is complimenting and applauding various aspects of Fontaine's directorial style. 1. \\"Fontaine's direction\\" – This implies that the speaker is focusing on the way Fontaine has orchestrated the film or project in question, indicating that the discussion is about Fontaine's directorial choices. 2. \\"Especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups\\" – This expresses highlight and praise for Fontaine's application of a specific film technique: close-ups. By terming these close-ups as 'agreeably startling,' it suggests that they are both surprising and pleasing to the viewer, and it was an impressive and innovative method to capture the audience's attention. This technique must have added more depth and intensity to the scenes, engaging the viewer more profoundly. 3. \\"Her grace with a moving camera\\" – Here, \\"grace\\" suggests efficiency, skill, and artfulness, illustrating appreciation towards how in-depth and well-handled the use of the so-called 'moving camera' is done during filming. The moving camera could refer to techniques like tracking shots, pans, tilts, hand-held shots, etc., creating a dynamic view that can artfully exhibit actions, shift viewer perspective, create tension, or indulge in detailed storytelling. By lauding Fontaine's 'grace,' it signifies that she maneuvered these techniques in a fluid, elegant, and well-crafted manner. 4. \\"Creates sheerly cinematic appeal\\" – This final remark underscores the whole point of the praise. It suggests that all these elements of direction – the surprising close-ups, the graceful moving-camera shots – contribute towards something that is 'cinetically appealing.' In other words, it's not only engaging to watch but also feel and experience. It's a commendation of making a movie not just visually, but also aesthetically pleasing, rewarding for the audience, and enriching for the cinematic art form. Hence, given all these points, the phrase can be interpreted as an endorsement or affirmation of Fontaine's directional prowess, indicating a positive opinion."},{"instruction":"Definition: In this task, you are given a list.

Eric Pickles yesterday defended the intelligence services over the Woolwich terror attack, saying it is impossible to control everyone all the time. The Communities Secretary said: ‘We need to be realistic that a free and open society is always vulnerable.’ However, he made clear that David Cameron is demanding to know ‘what went wrong’ after it emerged that the two suspected terrorists were known to MI5. Questions: Police and security services have faced criticism over what they knew about the suspected killers of Drummer Lee Rigby.

Government sources have revealed both suspects – Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale – appeared on lists of interest to the security services. Mr Pickles told the BBC: ‘Peers and MPs will do a thorough investigation in terms of what the security forces knew but I’ve seen experts on security explaining how difficult it is in a free society to be able to control everyone.’ He added: ‘The Prime Minister is very clear he wants to see an investigation about what went right and what went wrong. ‘It’s very important to stress these investigation are still going on.’ Terror suspect: Michael Adebolajo, who was filmed after Lee Rigby's killing with blood on his hands, was pictured (circled) at an Islamist demonstration in 2007 according to notorious hate preacher Anjem Choudary (right) Victim: Lee Rigby, 25, was yesterday named as the victim of the Woolwich knife attack.

Answer the following question: If I tell you that Changing the phase of a solid can be done by adding heat energy, and ask you the question \\"what can be done to a solid by adding heat energy?\\", is the correct answer \\"massive damage\\"? Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"massive damage\\". The term \\"massive damage\\" implies causing significant harm or destruction, which is not an accurate description of the process occurring when heat energy is added to a solid. The correct answer to the question, \\"What can be done to a solid by adding heat energy?\\" is that the heat energy can cause a change in the phase or state of the solid. When heat energy is added to a solid substance, the molecules or atoms gain kinetic energy, causing them to vibrate or move more rapidly. As the kinetic energy of the particles increases, they overcome the intermolecular or atomic forces that hold them together in the solid state. As a result, the substance undergoes a phase transition, changing from a solid to a liquid or possibly even directly to a gas, depending on the amount of heat energy added and the substance's properties. The process of a solid changing into a liquid upon heating is called melting, while the direct conversion of a solid into a gas is known as sublimation. When a solid melts into a liquid, the substance retains its chemical composition, but its physical properties, such as shape, density, and volume, can change. This is not a destructive process but rather a transformation. In summary, adding heat energy to a solid causes a change in its phase or state, which can result in melting or sublimation, depending on the properties of the substance and the conditions under which the process occurs. This transformation is not accurately described as \\"massive damage,\\" as it is a change in the physical state of the substance and is not destructive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

OLD TOWN - the heart and soul of Key West and the place most visitors spend their time - is only one mile by two. The Crew's house by the cemetery was less than half a mile from where they'd last seen Winston. Walking, it might've taken ten minutes to get there, but on Chloe's Vespa it was a hair-raising three-minute ride away. When they got there, Paul saw no sign of either Winston or Lily, so he assumed they were still inside the rundown shack that passed for a gallery. They parked a block away and approached at a brisk walk, Paul almost jogging to keep up with Chloe's excited strides. Winston was Chloe's mentor in what they referred to as \\"The Life,\\" this being a euphemism for a whole range of different activities, groups and lifestyles that fell under the general category of living underground and off the information grid. Paul, after defrauding his former partners and then running afoul of the law in a very public way, had been living The Life for almost a year and a half now. Chloe, as near as he could tell, had been doing it for almost a decade. Winston had started in the late '60s as a 16-year-old member of the notorious Weather Underground. He not only led his own Crew, he was also in contact with dozens, maybe scores of other such groups all over the world, including Chloe and Paul's little Crew of four. On top of all that, he'd once taken a couple bullets while helping Paul out, so, like Chloe, Paul had a soft spot in his heart for the old man. They hadn't seen him since that bloody night, but Chloe had been in communication with him off and on over the last sixteen months. Winston and his Crew were old school and didn't trust much in the way of electronic communications. Mostly it had been encoded, hand-delivered letters and arcane classified ads in various newspapers. Chloe found this particular breed of paranoia on Winston's part annoying, but Paul admired it. Question: What is probably true about Paul? Options:  A. not enough information  B. He's a child  C.

Make use of social support. Nurture your body. Be grateful. Turn to your spirituality. Article:","output":"Title: From Victimhood to Empowerment: A Journey of Self-Love, Positivity, and Gratitude Introduction In a fast-paced, demanding world, it is all too easy to slip into the role of a victim—a mindset fixated on external obstacles and one's own weaknesses. By relinquishing control and responsibility, this perspective puts personal growth and happiness at the mercy of external factors. However, there is a powerful alternative: a mindset centered on self-love, positivity, and gratitude. By implementing effective strategies such as nurturing one's body, seeking social support, and turning to spirituality, it is possible to transform from a victim to a self-empowered individual. The following guide will provide a step-by-step roadmap for this journey. Step 1: Stop Playing the Role of Victim The first step in the process of self-empowerment is to recognize and break out of the victim mentality. This involves taking responsibility for one's own actions and choices, as well as acknowledging the power to change one's circumstances. Embrace the challenges and setbacks as opportunities for growth, instead of dwelling on them as insurmountable obstacles. Step 2: Kick Negative Self-Talk to the Curb Negative self-talk is a self-destructive thought pattern that can erode self-confidence and hinder personal growth. Recognize these thoughts and replace them with positive affirmations and self-compassionate reflections. By cultivating a more uplifting inner dialogue, you can combat negativity and build confidence in your abilities. Step 3: Love Yourself and Others Developing a strong sense of self-love is key to unlocking one's full potential. This involves appreciating oneself for both strengths and imperfections, striving for growth without being overly critical or demanding. Extend this love to others, by treating everyone with kindness, empathy, and understanding, which will help create a more fulfilling and compassionate environment. Step 4: Engage in Regular Activities You Love Make time for hobbies and interests that bring joy and passion into your life. These activities are not only ideal for self-expression but also serve as reminders of your talents and skills. Furthermore, engaging in activities you love can provide respite from daily stressors and enhance overall well-being. Step 5: Make Use of Social Support Relying on a strong network of friends and family for support and encouragement is crucial for personal growth and happiness. Sharing experiences, exchanging advice, or simply lending a listening ear is invaluable in navigating life's challenges. Don't hesitate to reach out to others when in need, and be willing to offer support in return. Step 6: Nurture Your Body A healthy body is the foundation for a healthy mind. Prioritizing physical wellness through exercise, nutritious meals, and sufficient sleep is essential for both mental and emotional well-being. Treat your body with love and care, recognizing that it is the vessel that carries you through your life's journey. Step 7: Be Grateful Cultivating gratitude is a powerful method of shifting focus away from negative thoughts and toward positive aspects of one's life. Acknowledge the blessings and opportunities around you, and consider adopting a gratitude practice, such as journaling or meditation, to transform your outlook on life. Step 8: Turn to Your Spirituality For many, spirituality offers guidance and emotional support in the face of adversity. Regardless of your faith or belief system, seeking solace and understanding through spiritual practices can foster inner strength and resilience. Conclusion Embracing a mindset of self-love, positivity, and gratitude is the key to overcoming the victim mentality and becoming a self-empowered individual. By following these steps, you can foster personal growth, inner strength, and ultimately, a happier, more fulfilling life. The journey may not always be easy, but it is undoubtedly worth the effort."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - A forest fire starts - The fire surrounds the vicinity - The animals are trapped - Those that survive have their habitat destroyed - The survivors must find a new habitat - Conflict with other animals occur.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose no people put the fire out happens, how will it affect a GREATER negative effect on animals.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"To answer the question, let's analyze the perturbation hypothesis step-by-step and examine its effects on the process. Perturbation Hypothesis: Suppose no people put the fire out happens. Step 1: A forest fire starts - The perturbation does not have a direct effect on the starting of the fire. However, given that no people will put out the fire, the fire will likely spread further and faster than if there were human intervention. Step 2: The fire surrounds the vicinity - With no human intervention, the fire will continue to spread and surround the area. This will affect more animals and extend across a larger area than if the fire were put out, or at least controlled. Step 3: The animals are trapped - As the fire engulfs the area faster due to lack of intervention, more animals will be unable to escape and will be trapped. The negative effect on animals increases as the chances of survival decrease. Step 4: Those that survive have their habitat destroyed - With no one to put the fire out, the spread of the fire will have a greater impact and damage a larger portion of the habitat. This leads to more significant habitat loss for surviving animals. Step 5: The survivors must find a new habitat - As a larger area has been affected and more extensive habitat loss has occurred, the surviving animals will face even more challenges in finding new habitats. This will increase competition for resources and create additional stress on the animals. Step 6: Conflict with other animals occurs - As more animals are forced to find a new habitat due to a more extensive fire, the chances of conflict between animals also increase. More significant habitat loss and displacement of species may lead to a ripple effect on ecosystem balance and functioning. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Due to the lack of human intervention in putting out the fire, the fire spreads faster and affects a larger area, which in turn leads to a greater negative effect on the involved animals and their habitats."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In the 1960s,[9] a young woman[9] nicknamed Babydoll (Emily Browning) is institutionalized by her abusive widowed stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) at the fictional Lennox House for the Mentally Insane in Brattleboro, Vermont, after she is blamed for her younger sister's death.

Q:What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Cool\\" A:","output":"Without any specific context or a detailed explanation about the experience or use of the product, service, or experience in the given review, it is difficult to assign a concrete ★-rating based solely on the word \\"Cool\\".  Typically, product reviews are more nuanced and detailed. However, we could consider a number of approaches to possibly infer a rating from this review: 1. Positive Connotation Approach: Assuming that the word \\"Cool\\" is meant in a positive context — as it usually means something likable or agreeable — we can infer that this review implies a generally positive experience or perception. However, the lack of depth or enthusiasm might suggest it isn't the highest possible rating. In this case, the rating could be somewhere in the middle, around ★★★. 2. Effort Approach: Considering the effort put into writing the review, the brevity of it could suggest a lack of a strong feeling one way or another. The user wasn't motivated to write a detailed review, which might happen when somebody has an extremely positive (★★★★★) or negative (★) experience. So, in this case, we might infer a middle rating of ★★★. 3. Enthusiasm Approach: If we consider this single word to imply a level of simplicity, modernity, or trendiness, it could be perceived as a succinct but highly positive review. In that case, it might lean towards a ★★★★ or even ★★★★★. Given those possible approaches, note that any rating assigned would be a rough estimation, as the provided review \\"Cool\\" is quite vague. For a more precise rating, a more detailed review would be better. Assessing star ratings often requires comprehensive feedback, covering different aspects such as quality, usability, price, customer service (in case of a service), or the overall experience.  In conclusion, with ambiguity in terms like \\"Cool\\", AI has limitations as it requires explicit context or additional information to make completely accurate judgments. This is why detailed reviews are important, especially in AI-based analysis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable? Bill is likely John to hit.","output":"The given sentence, \\"Bill is likely John to hit,\\" is neither syntactically nor semantically acceptable. Let's break down the sentence to understand the reasons behind this conclusion: 1. Syntactic acceptability: Syntactic acceptability refers to whether a sentence conforms to the rules of syntax, which govern the arrangement of words and phrases in a sentence to create well-formed sentences in a specific language. In the case of the provided sentence, the syntax does not follow standard English word order or construction. A more appropriate way to arrange the sentence to convey the intended meaning would be: \\"Bill is likely to hit John.\\" This sentence follows the standard Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order found in English. The subject \\"Bill\\" is followed by the modal verb \\"is likely to\\" (indicating probability) and the verb \\"hit.\\" The object \\"John\\" comes after the verb, as expected in SVO word order. 2. Semantic acceptability: Semantic acceptability refers to whether a sentence makes sense in terms of meaning and logic. The sentence \\"Bill is likely John to hit\\" creates confusion about the intended meaning due to its incorrect syntax. While we can somewhat guess that the sentence aims to convey that Bill might hit John, the incorrect arrangement of words makes it unclear upon first reading. The sentence \\"Bill is likely to hit John\\" is semantically acceptable because it clearly conveys that there is a probability of Bill causing harm to John. In conclusion, the original sentence \\"Bill is likely John to hit\\" is neither syntactically nor semantically acceptable in its original form. To communicate the intended message more effectively in English, it is better to use the sentence \\"Bill is likely to hit John,\\" which is both syntactically and semantically acceptable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: Before Stanton narrowed her political focus almost exclusively to women's rights, she was an active abolitionist together with her husband, Henry Brewster Stanton and cousin, Gerrit Smith . Question: what movement was elizabeth cady stanton a part of Answer:","output":"Elizabeth Cady Stanton was a prominent figure in multiple movements throughout her life, most notably the women's rights and the abolitionist movements. 1. Women's Rights Movement: Elizabeth Cady Stanton is best known for her tireless efforts and leadership in the women's rights movement. In July 1848, she joined forces with Lucretia Mott and other like-minded women to organize the Seneca Falls Convention in Seneca Falls, New York. This gathering was the first-ever women's rights convention in the United States and marked the beginning of organized attempts to secure rights and opportunities for women. At the convention, Stanton drafted the Declaration of Sentiments, which drew heavily from the United States Declaration of Independence. The document outlined the civil, social, and political rights that women should have, including the right to vote. Stanton's pursuit of gender equality continued throughout her life, pushing for the passage of the 19th Amendment (granting women the right to vote). 2. Abolitionist Movement: Before narrowing her focus almost exclusively to women's rights, Elizabeth Cady Stanton was an active abolitionist. She was staunchly against slavery and joined her husband, Henry Brewster Stanton, and cousin, Gerrit Smith, in fighting for the emancipation and rights of enslaved individuals. Stanton frequently attended and spoke at abolitionist meetings, where she further developed her skills as an orator and made key connections with fellow activists such as Susan B. Anthony, whom she would later collaborate with on numerous women's rights initiatives. Although the women's rights and abolitionist movements were her primary areas of involvement, Elizabeth Cady Stanton also advocated for various social reforms, including temperance, better education, and improved divorce laws. Throughout her life, Stanton remained dedicated to social justice and equality, leaving a lasting impact on both the women's rights and abolitionist movements."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given a sentence in the Swedish language and your task is to convert it into the English language.

Alongside Palin, the cast includes Ben Chaplin, Julian Rhind-Tutt, Steve Oram and Emilia Fox. The Monty Python star is now best known on TV for his travel series. Palin's last TV drama role was in Alan Bleasdale's GBH in 1991, in which he played a school headmaster intimidated by a newly-elected city council leader, played by Robert Lindsay. Palin said in a Bafta interview earlier this year that he considered the role one of his career highlights. In its official announcement on Tuesday, the BBC described The Wipers Times as \\"a story of the extraordinary resilience of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming adversity\\". Ben Chaplin plays Captain Fred Roberts, who discovers a printing press in the bombed-out ruins of Belgian town Ypres in 1916 and uses it to publish The Wipers Times (named after the army slang for Ypres). The paper's subversive humour proves popular with soldiers on the front line but goes down less well with their superior officers. \\"Just like the original Wipers Times, this new history drama will be filled with jokes, spoofs and amazing examples of courage behind the laughs,\\" said Janice Hadlow, controller of BBC Two.

Its other titles included The Somme Times and, after the Armistice, The Better Times.

Vastustamme Timothy McVeighin teloitusta, vaikka hän onkin murhaaja. Translate to English","output":"We oppose Timothy McVeigh's execution, even though he is a murderer. It is important to elaborate on the possible reasons why someone might hold this position, as well as provide further context behind this statement. 1. Human rights argument: Some people fundamentally believe that no person should be subjected to the death penalty, regardless of the nature of their crime. They argue that it is a violation of an individual's right to life, dignity, and freedom from cruel and inhumane treatment. This perspective is based on the idea that every person, even criminals, has an inherent right to life. 2. Moral or ethical standpoint: Some people are morally opposed to the death penalty due to religious or ethical grounds. They believe that it is not ethical for humans, including the state or judicial system, to take another person's life. This might be based on various religious beliefs, advocating for forgiveness and justice rather than retribution. 3. Chance of wrongful execution: There is always the possibility that a person may be wrongfully convicted and executed, or that new evidence may come to light after the execution has taken place. Opponents of the death penalty argue that the irreversible nature of capital punishment is too definite a punishment to take the chance of accidental execution of innocent people. 4. Critique of the justice system: Some argue that the criminal justice system is flawed and may treat certain groups unfairly. As a result, not every accused person is given a fair trial or representation. This may result in unequal application of the death penalty. Moreover, studies have shown that economically disadvantaged people and racial minorities are more likely to receive the death penalty. 5. The question of deterrence: The deterrence argument claims that the death penalty prevents crime by intimidating would-be criminals, thus serving as an effective crime prevention measure. However, studies and statistical research have shown inconclusive results on the death penalty's ability to deter crime effectively. In comparing states or countries with and without capital punishment, it is often found that there are no significant differences in murder rates or other violent crime statistics. 6. Reformation and rehabilitation: Instead of focusing on harsh punishment, opponents of the death penalty may argue that it is more productive to focus on reforming and rehabilitating criminals. It is suggested that a criminal should not be executed but should instead have the opportunity to reform themselves in a correctional facility, potentially becoming a valuable member of society. In the specific case of Timothy McVeigh, who was executed in 2001 for his role in the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people, some opponents may argue that the above reasons still apply in this high-profile case. While his crimes were heinous and brought great suffering upon many, they may feel that the death penalty was still not the right response, and that it goes against the principles of human rights, morality, and the potential for rehabilitation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Their marriage was a mistake of World War II. And about 50 years ago, I was the only child I knew who didn't have a father at home on Father's Day. Divorce was very uncommon back then. So when my friends were in town shopping for presents for their fathers, I decided since my mother was both Mother and Father, no one else was like her, who better deserved(be worth) a present on Father's Day than her? I bought her a little set of tools, just a few things, hammer, pliers  and screwdriver  and a box to put all these things in. I got some ideas from my grandfather and named it Mother's Tool Box. She was excited, more at the thought of being cared for on Father's Day than of the present. She always said she liked her Father's Day memories better than the Mother's Day ones.

Given the question: Article: There is a popular belief among parents that schools are no longer interested in spelling. No school I have ever taught in has ever ignored spelling or considered it unimportant as a basic skill. There are, however, different ideas about how to teach it, or how much priority   it must be given over general language development and writing ability. The problem is how to encourage a child to express himself freely and confidently in writing without holding him back with the complexities   of spelling. If spelling becomes the only focal   point of his teacher's interest, clearly a bright child will be likely to \\"play safe\\". He will tend to write only words within his spelling range, choosing to avoid adventurous language. That's why teachers often encourage the early use of dictionaries and pay attention to content rather than technical ability. I was once shocked to read on the bottom of a sensitive piece of writing about a personal experience: \\"This work is terrible! There are far too many spelling errors and your writing is terrible.\\" It may have been a sharp criticism of the pupil's technical abilities in writing, but it was also a sad reflection on the teacher who had omitted to read the essay, which contained some beautiful expressions of the child's deep feelings. The teacher was not wrong to draw attention to the errors, but if his priorities had centered on the child's ideas, an expression of his disappointment with the presentation would have given the pupil more motivation   to seek improvement. Question: Teachers encourage the use of dictionaries so that   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"students will be able to express their ideas more freely\\"? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"students will be able to express their ideas more freely.\\" Step 1: Read and understand the article and question. In the article, the author discusses the importance of spelling in schools, differing teaching methods, and how focusing too much on spelling can hinder a child's ability to express themselves creatively and confidently in writing. Step 2: Identify relevant information in the article. The author explains that teachers often encourage dictionary use because they want students to be able to focus on content and not just technical ability. Step 3: Answer the question based on the relevant information. \\"Teachers encourage the use of dictionaries so that students will be able to express their ideas more freely.\\" Step 4: Justify the answer by connecting it to the article. The article states that one of the issues with getting children to express themselves freely is the focus on spelling. By encouraging the use of dictionaries, teachers are trying to strike a balance between helping students improve their spelling while also allowing them to express their ideas and use adventurous language without fear of making mistakes. So, the answer \\"Yes\\" demonstrates that this approach aims to make students more capable of expressing their ideas freely."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Use the following highlights to write an article: U.S. President Obama faces battle with Congress over new F-22 Raptor. Obama, Defense Secretary Gates don't want any more of the 350M fighter jets. Many in Congress see F-22 as way of protecting defense industry jobs. Obama has threatened to veto legislation ordering more fighter jets. Article:","output":"Title: President Obama Stands Firm Against F-22 Raptor Production: A Clash with Congress Looms Introduction: The U.S. President Barack Obama and Congress are on a collision course over the procurement of the advanced F-22 Raptor fighter jets. Despite opposition from both the President and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, many lawmakers continue to push for additional orders of the expensive aircraft, primarily in a bid to preserve jobs in the defense industry. Body: 1. Obama and Gates' stance on F-22 Raptor  President Obama and Defense Secretary Gates have taken a firm stand against ordering any more of the 350 million fighter jets, arguing that the existing fleet is sufficient and that resources should be allocated to other vital defense programs. The administration's resistance against purchasing more F-22s represents a shift in national security priorities and a move towards more cost-effective solutions. 2. Congressional support for F-22 Raptor  Despite the administration's position, several lawmakers in Congress have continued to advocate for additional F-22 fighter jets. Their primary motivation seems to be protecting defense industry jobs, as the jet's production involves numerous subcontractors and manufacturers spread across the U.S. The potential loss of employment in the defense sector has spurred many in Congress to support the continued production of the F-22 Raptor. 3. Obama's veto threat  In response to congressional attempts to order more fighter jets, President Obama has threatened to veto any legislation mandating additional F-22 production. Such a veto would ensure that the administration's vision for more efficient and judicious defense spending is preserved, but could set the stage for a contentious relationship with Congress. 4. Implications of the clash  The conflict between the President and Congress over the F-22 Raptor illustrates the complexity of national security policy decisions and the delicate balance between military preparedness and economic considerations. Ultimately, this battle over defense spending could have wider implications for U.S. national security priorities and the relationship between the executive branch and the legislature. Conclusion: As President Obama faces a battle with Congress over the procurement of new F-22 Raptor fighter jets, the decisions taken in this fraught conflict will have lasting effects on U.S. defense policy and the overall dynamic between the executive and legislative branches. While economic factors such as job preservation weigh heavily on the minds of lawmakers, the administration must carefully navigate the complex challenge of balancing fiscal responsibility with national security interests."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Emperor Zhang's (r. 75–88 AD) reign came to be viewed by later Eastern Han scholars as the high point of the dynastic house. Subsequent reigns were increasingly marked by eunuch intervention in court politics and their involvement in the violent power struggles of the imperial consort clans. With the aid of the eunuch Zheng Zhong (d. 107 AD), Emperor He (r. 88–105 AD) had Empress Dowager Dou (d. 97 AD) put under house arrest and her clan stripped of power. This was in revenge for Dou's purging of the clan of his natural mother—Consort Liang—and then concealing her identity from him. After Emperor He's death, his wife Empress Deng Sui (d. 121 AD) managed state affairs as the regent empress dowager during a turbulent financial crisis and widespread Qiang rebellion that lasted from 107 to 118 AD.

Write highlights for this article: Garry Monk is ready to take his place in the 'madhouse' after being appointed as manager of Barclays Premier League club Swansea. Monk has spoken with several of his new managerial colleagues in English football's top flight after landing a three-year contract at the Liberty Stadium. 'A lot of them said \\"welcome to the madhouse\\". In fact, pretty much every one of them has said that,' said Monk, who revealed via his Twitter account on Friday night that he had officially retired as a player. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Monk talk about the honour and privilege of managing Swansea. New recruit: Garry Monk is ready to join the Premier League 'madhouse' as permanent Swansea manager. 'I think the bottom line is, out of all the advice I have had, the most important bit is that they have just said be yourself, don't try and be something else. 'For me it has to be that way. You have to learn from what you have done, and that is what I am going to do. 'I have it clear in my mind what I want, and though I am not going to say it's going to be easy to get there, I will try to get there. 'For me, Tony Pulis (Crystal Palace manager) was one of the best I spoke to, to be honest. 'After the game (against Swansea) he came in and spoke. It was a proper manager speaking. He was very honest about his group and my group and the way they work, why they do it. I found it very interesting. 'There have been quite a few managers, and all of them I have spoken to have been good to me. They have been very supportive and encouraging.' Ousted: Monk took charge of the club after Michael Laudrup was sacked in February. Victors: Despite leading them to League Cup victory just 12 months earlier. Adventurers: Napoli's Gonzalo Higuain celebrates their Europa League win over Swansea behind Ben Davies. Monk has been elevated from the head-coaching role he took on in early February after Swansea dispensed with Michael Laudrup's managerial services. During that time, despite a few setbacks in terms of results, he ultimately guided Swansea away from relegation danger and towards mid-table heading into Sunday's season finale at Sunderland. 'It hasn't really sunk in. All I have been thinking about is the games,' he added. 'Everything that happened in the week was great, but we've got a game on Sunday. I went home and I was just planning the training sessions for the next day and what I would say to the players regarding the Sunderland game. I didn't want to make it too much of a distraction to anyone else. 'Because it's not about me right now, it's about finishing the season, and I guess when I get to the summer I will probably reflect upon what has gone on and the magnitude of it.' For his part, Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins has no doubt about Monk's qualities. The Swans have a track record for getting managerial appointments right, as shown by former bosses like Roberto Martinez and Brendan Rodgers, and Jenkins feels that Monk is from a familiar mould. Pedigree: Former Swansea bosses Roberto Martinez and Brendan Rodgers now running Merseyside. 'Like every decision we make, whatever manager you bring in is a gamble. You only have to look to other Premier League clubs to see what has gone on to see that 10 or so managers have changed,\\" Jenkins said. 'That argument is completely overshadowed by the fact every club needs, first and foremost, good people you can work with and people you think will take on the challenge, and I think as always at our club look to build their experience and improve things and set their mark. 'The biggest qualities are commitment and a passion for the job and working for Swansea City with the way we want to work. He (Monk) has got the thirst to learn and grow in experience. 'The other side is every young manager in his position will make mistakes, like experienced managers do. You just hope while he's learning we still carry on and achieve success, That is all you can hope for. 'He has got ideas and thoughts of how he would like to implement some of the way we work in the backroom staff like other managers have, and I can see that growing as he gains in confidence as he goes along.'","output":"Garry Monk is ready to join the Premier League 'madhouse' after being appointed as manager of Swansea.

When garnished with onion, a martini is called a Gibson martini. Use small pearl onions, which are often marketed for cocktails. They usually come in a jar and are often pickled in brine. If you’re in a pinch, try garnishing with a slice of regular white or sweet onion, but remember that it might not quite give you the taste you are hoping for. Onions are sometimes pickled with paprika or turmeric, along with the pickling brine. If you have onions that are adding too much of the wrong kind of flavor to your drink, rinse them off quickly with cold water. Keep in mind that rinsing them will take away some of the flavor, so only do it if you feel it’s absolutely necessary. You have the choice to skewer the onions or place them directly in the drink. Ask the drinker which they prefer. Rest the toothpick against the side of the cocktail glass when you serve the drink. The skewer is convenient because it allows the drinker to easily pull the onion out of the drink if they want to eat it. Summary:","output":"A Gibson martini is garnished with small pearl onions, often pickled in brine, and can be skewered or placed directly in the drink, with rinsing optional if the onion flavor is too strong."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Translate to English English:","output":"The issue at hand is a discussion initiated in the European Commission's Green Paper as the digital age penetrates our lives and globalization poses a challenge to the cultural industry and creative industries. In the context of the European Commission's Green Paper, a dialogue has been launched to address the impact of the digital age and globalization on the cultural and creative industries. As technology continues to advance and reshape the way we live, work, and interact, various industries are forced to adapt and evolve to stay relevant and competitive in the global market. The digital age has brought about numerous innovations and opportunities for growth in various sectors, including the cultural and creative industries. However, it has also presented new challenges, such as the protection of intellectual property rights, ensuring fair remuneration for creators, and maintaining cultural diversity in the face of global conglomerates and monopolistic competition. Globalization has further intensified these challenges. As the exchange of goods, services, information, and ideas become increasingly borderless, the cultural and creative industries are confronted with both an expanding potential audience and fierce competition from across the globe. This situation demands constant innovation and adaptation, as well as the development and implementation of effective strategies to preserve and promote the uniqueness of each cultural and creative industry. In response to these challenges, the European Commission's Green Paper aims to facilitate a comprehensive and constructive discussion on the current state of the cultural and creative industries in the digital age and the effects of globalization. By engaging various stakeholders, such as artists, creators, policymakers, and business representatives, the dialogue seeks to identify the key issues and challenges faced by these industries. It also aspires to develop appropriate frameworks, policies, and strategies to support their growth and competitiveness, while safeguarding the cultural values and diversity that makes them unique. Overall, the initiative taken by the European Commission through its Green Paper serves as an essential platform for addressing the pressing issues and challenges faced by the cultural and creative industries in today's rapidly globalizing and digitizing world. By fostering an open and inclusive dialogue, European policymakers can better understand the intricacies of these industries and create effective solutions that promote their long-term sustainability and success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","output":"prokaryotes. Viruses are infectious agents that can only replicate inside the living cells of a host organism. They are known to infect a wide range of organisms, including animals, plants, and microorganisms such as bacteria. However, based on the given choices, we can select the most fitting answer. Bacteria are classified as prokaryotes because they have simple cell structures, lacking a clearly defined nucleus and sub-cellular organelles found in eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes are the most ancient and diverse group of organisms on Earth, and they are ubiquitous in the environment. Among the answer choices provided, \\"prokaryotes\\" is the best match for the organisms that viruses often infect. This is in line with the understanding that many viruses, called bacteriophages, specifically target bacteria. Bacteriophages play a crucial role in regulating bacterial populations and have been studied extensively for their potential in treating bacterial infections. While the other answer choices listed—mammals, insects, and the skin—do include organisms or tissues that can be infected by viruses, they are not as encompassing or precise as the term \\"prokaryotes.\\" Mammals and insects are both types of eukaryotes, which have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. As for the remaining choices—dead H2O particles, volume, A computer, and clouds—they are not suitable or relevant in the context of biological viruses. Although \\"A computer\\" can be infected by a different kind of virus called a computer virus, this type of virus is not comparable to biological viruses. Computer viruses are programs designed to replicate and spread between computer systems, causing damage and disruption to software and hardware.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the information you found is correct regarding the conversion of vitamin D in the liver to calcidiol (25(OH)D). However, it does not fully address the question of where vitamin D is found. Vitamin D is found in three main sources: 1. Sunlight: Our skin synthesizes vitamin D when exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) rays from the sun. This is the most natural way to obtain vitamin D. 2. Food: Vitamin D can be found in a limited number of foods, including fatty fish (such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel), fish liver oils, beef liver, cheese, and egg yolks. Some mushrooms, like maitake and shiitake, also contain vitamin D. Additionally, certain foods are fortified with vitamin D, such as milk, orange juice, and breakfast cereals. 3. Supplements: Vitamin D supplements are available in the form of capsules, tablets, or liquid drops. They can help improve vitamin D levels in individuals who do not get enough sunlight exposure, have difficulty absorbing the vitamin from the food they eat, or have certain medical conditions. In summary, vitamin D is synthesized in the skin when exposed to sunlight, found in certain foods, and available in supplement form.

A widower with a 12 year old daughter, Elspeth (Janette Scott), Honey is sent from Farnborough to investigate the crash of a Rutland Reindeer airliner in Labrador, Canada. He theorizes the accident happened because of the tailplane's structural failure, caused by sudden metal fatigue after 1440 flight hours. To test the theory in his laboratory, a rear airframe is being vibrated at a very high rate in daily eight-hour cycles. It is not until Honey finds himself on board a Reindeer airliner that he realizes he is flying on an early production aircraft that is close to the number of hours his theory projects for the metal fatigue failure. Despite the fact that his theory is not yet proven, he decides to warn the aircrew and Hollywood actress Monica Teasdale (Marlene Dietrich), a fellow passenger. After the Reindeer safely lands at Gander Airport in Newfoundland, an inspection clears the aircraft to continue on its route. Honey then takes drastic action to stop the flight by activating the Reindeer's port undercarriage lever, dropping the airliner on its belly, damaging it. Shocked by the act, some of his colleagues demand that he be declared insane to discredit his unproved theory and save the reputation of British passenger aviation now awash in a sea of bad press. Teasdale and Reindeer flight attendant Marjorie Corder (Glynis Johns) both take a liking to Honey and Elspeth, who they discover is lonely and isolated from her schoolmates.

When the king is killed while suppressing a peasant rebellion, Einon is mortally wounded by the peasant girl Kara (Sandra Kovacikova). Einon's mother, Queen Aislinn (Julie Christie), has him taken before a dragon whom she implores to save the boy's life.

The new wave of diplomats often came from those programs. Archaeology on the international scene, although very much of intellectual interest to the major universities, fell into the shadow of international relations. Their domain became the Ancient Near East, which could no longer be relied upon to be the Near East. The Ottoman Empire was gone, along with all the other empires of the 19th century, replaced with independent republics. Someone had to reconcile the present with the past. This duty was inherited by various specialized agencies that were formed to handle specific aspects of international relations, now so complex as to be beyond the scope and abilities of a diplomatic corps in the former sense. The ancient Near East is frozen in time. The living Near East is primarily what the agencies say it is.

The startling images were released today by the U.S. Attorney's Office as the officers who fatally shot Miriam Carey after a high-speed car chase from the White House to the Capitol learned they will not face criminal charges. One still, taken from video footage at the White House checkpoint, shows a U.S. Secret Service officer trying to get Carey's attention after she entered the restricted area. Another shows an off-duty Secret Service officer move a barricade in front of the exit path in an attempt to prevent Carey from leaving.

Context: Hoping to rebound from their loss at New England, the Broncos traveled to Qualcomm Stadium for an AFC West duel with the San Diego Chargers on Monday Night Football. The Chargers jumped out to a 10-0 lead in the first quarter, with a 32-yard field goal by placekicker Nick Novak, followed by a 15-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Philip Rivers to tight end Antonio Gates. Both scores came off Broncos' miscues on special teams&#8212;the former occurred after Trindon Holliday muffed a punt return, while the latter occurred after Omar Bolden coughed up the football on a kickoff return. The Broncos were attempting to narrow the Chargers' lead midway through the second quarter, but wide receiver Eric Decker stumbled near the Chargers' 30-yard line when it appeared that he was headed to the end zone for an easy touchdown, after receiving a 55-yard pass from quarterback Peyton Manning. Three plays later, Manning threw an interception that was returned by Chargers' cornerback Quentin Jammer 80 yards for a touchdown. The Chargers increased their lead to 24-0 just before halftime, with Rivers connecting on an 11-yard touchdown pass to Gates. The Broncos then staged one of the most memorable comebacks in Monday Night Football history. On the opening drive of the second half, Manning led the Broncos on an 8-play, 85-yard drive, culminating with a 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. On the Chargers' next possession, Broncos' defensive end Elvis Dumervil forced a fumble off Rivers, and cornerback Tony Carter scooped up the football and returned it 65 yards for a touchdown. After the Broncos' defense forced a three-and-out, Manning hooked up with Decker on a 7-yard touchdown pass to pull the Broncos within 24-21 early in the fourth quarter. On the Chargers' next possession, Carter picked off Rivers, and four plays later, Manning tossed a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandon Stokley to give the Broncos a 28-24 lead with 9:09 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Chargers were attempting to rally, but Rivers was intercepted by cornerback Chris Harris, Jr. with 6:54 remaining. However, the Broncos were forced to punt seven plays later, giving the Chargers' offense the football with four minutes remaining. The Chargers once again tried to rally, but six plays later, Harris stepped in front of another Rivers' pass, returning an interception 46 yards for a touchdown, sealing the win for the Broncos.

Q:This article: Even in his own homeland the general public was slow to recognise Smetana. As a young composer and pianist he was well regarded in Prague musical circles, and had the approval of Liszt, Proksch and others, but the public's lack of acknowledgement was a principal factor behind his self-imposed exile in Sweden. After his return he was not taken particularly seriously, and was hard put to get audiences for his new works, hence his \\"prophet without honour\\" remark after the nearly empty hall and indifferent reception of Richard III and Wallenstein's Camp at Žofín Island in January 1862.Smetana's first noteworthy public success was his initial opera The Brandenburgers in Bohemia, in 1866 when he was already 42 years old. His second opera, The Bartered Bride, survived the unfortunate mistiming of its opening night and became an enduring popular triumph. The different style of his third opera, Dalibor, closer to that of Wagnerian music drama, was not readily understood by the public and was condemned by critics who believed that Czech opera should be based on folk-song. It disappeared from the repertory after only a handful of performances. Thereafter the machinations that accompanied Smetana's tenure as Provisional Theatre conductor restricted his creative output until 1874. In his final decade, the most fruitful of his compositional career despite his deafness and increasing ill-health, Smetana belatedly received national recognition. Of his later operas, The Two Widows and The Secret were warmly received, while The Kiss was greeted by an \\"overwhelming ovation\\". The ceremonial opera Libuše was received with thunderous applause for the composer; by this time (1881) the disputes around his music had declined, and the public was ready to honour him as the founder of Czech music. Nevertheless, the first few performances in October 1882 of an evidently under-rehearsed The Devil's Wall were chaotic, and the composer was left feeling \\"dishonoured and dispirited.\\" This disappointment was swiftly mitigated by the acclaim... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was left feeling dishonoured and dispirited?, what is it ?

During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood. Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative Artemis. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana defies her mother and, her face hidden by a helmet and her guard duty covered by her bookish but kind-hearted Amazon sister Alexa, participates in contests of strength and wins the right to take Trevor back to his home., what would be the answer ?

Background: Stereolab were an English-French avant-pop band from London, formed in 1990 by Tim Gane (guitar/keyboards) and Laetitia Sadier (vocals/keyboards/guitar) who both remained at the songwriting helm across many line-up changes. Other long-time members included Mary Hansen (backing vocals/keyboards/guitar), who joined in 1992 and remained in the line-up until her accidental death in 2002, and Andy Ramsay (drums), who joined in 1993 and is still in the official line-up. Sean O'Hagan of the High Llamas was a member from 1993 to 1994, and continued appearing on later records for occasional guest appearances. The group's music combined influences from krautrock, lounge and 1960s pop music. Context: Stereolab's music is politically and philosophically charged. Laetitia Sadier, who writes the group's lyrics, said that her inspiration was most recently her anger towards the Iraq War. The Surrealist and Situationist cultural and political movements were also influences, as noted by Sadier and Gane in a 1999 Salon.com interview. Stewart Mason commented in an AllMusic review that the lyrics from the 1997 song \\"Miss Modular\\" \\"sound influenced by the Situationist theory of the 'spectacle'.\\"  Critics have noted Marxist allusions in the band's lyrics, and have gone so far as to call the band members themselves Marxist. Music journalist Simon Reynolds commented that Sadier's lyrics tend to lean towards Marxist social commentary rather than \\"affairs of the heart\\". \\"Ping Pong\\", a 1994 single included on the album Mars Audiac Quintet, was noted for its alleged Marxist lyrics. In the song, Sadier sings \\"about capitalism's cruel cycles of slump and recovery\\" with lyrics that constitute \\"a plainspoken explanation of one of the central tenets of Marxian economic analysis\\" (said critics Simon Reynolds and Stewart Mason, respectively).  Band members have resisted attempts to link the group and its music to Marxism. In a 1999 interview, Gane stated that \\"none of us are Marxists ... I've never even read Marx.\\" Gane said that although Sadier's lyrics touch on political topics, they do not cross the line into \\"sloganeering\\". Sadier also said that she had read very little Marx. In contrast, Cornelius Castoriadis, a radical political philosopher but strong critic of Marxism, has been cited as a marking influence in Sadier's thinking. The name of her side project, Monade, and its debut album title, Socialisme ou Barbarie, are also references to the work of Castoriadis.  Stereolab's album and song titles occasionally reference avant-garde political groups and artists. Gane said that the title of their 1999 album Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night contains the names of two Surrealist organisations, \\"CoBrA\\" and \\"Phases Group\\", \\"Brakhage\\", the title of the first song on the 1997 album Dots and Loops, is a nod to experimental filmmaker Stan Brakhage. Other examples are the 1992 compilation Switched On, named after Wendy Carlos' 1968 album Switched on Bach, and the 1992 single \\"John Cage Bubblegum\\", named after experimental composer John Cage. Question: what was special about the lyrics? Answer:","output":"The lyrics of Stereolab's music were special due to several unique aspects: 1. Politically and philosophically charged content: Unlike many of their contemporaries, Stereolab's lyrics were deeply infused with political and philosophical messages, emphasizing societal issues and critiques. Laetitia Sadier's inspiration ranged from anger towards events like the Iraq War to cultural and political movements like Surrealism and Situationism. 2. Situationist theory and the concept of the 'spectacle': Several songs, like \\"Miss Modular,\\" touched upon themes rooted in Situationist theory, which emphasizes the role of the 'spectacle' in modern society - a critical examination of the consumerist culture and the way it shapes perceptions of reality. 3. Marxist allusions: Critics often found Marxist references in Stereolab's lyrics, leading to the perception that the band members themselves were Marxists. Songs like \\"Ping Pong\\" showcased lyrics that seemed to analyze the dynamics of capitalism through a Marxist lens. 4. Resistance to labeling and intellectual diversity: Despite the Marxist allusions, Stereolab's members resisted attempts to label them or their music as explicitly Marxist. They acknowledged the presence of political themes but emphasized the importance of avoiding simplistic \\"sloganeering.\\" Instead, their influences came from a diverse array of thinkers like Cornelius Castoriadis, a radical political philosopher critical of Marxism. 5. References to avant-garde political groups and artists: Stereolab's album and song titles often paid homage to avant-garde political organizations and artists. For example, the title of their 1999 album, \\"Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night,\\" contains the names of two Surrealist organizations, \\"CoBrA\\" and \\"Phases Group.\\" Other examples include references to experimental filmmakers like Stan Brakhage and composers like John Cage, showcasing the band's deep connection to the broader cultural context of their work. In conclusion, Stereolab's lyrics were special due to their politically and philosophically charged content, intellectual diversity, allusions to various political theories, and connections to cutting-edge artists and cultural movements. Their unique lyrical approach allowed them to stand out in the landscape of avant-pop music and made their work an enduring part of the genre's history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Starter Edwin Jackson shows some of best stuff Washington Nationals starter Edwin Jackson walked the first batter he faced on Friday night. The third batter doubled, and the cleanup hitter singled in a run. It was hardly a way to begin what would become among Jackson’s most commanding starts this season, yet that’s exactly how it ended when he left the game after eight innings and 95 pitches during a 2-1 loss to the Baltimore Orioles on Friday night at Nationals Park. During five of his final seven innings, Jackson retired the side in order. He finished with eight strikeouts, allowed five hits and walked one in lowering his ERA to 3.31 before watching reliever Ryan Mattheus surrender an 11th inning homer to Nick Markakis that was the difference. “I was just able to come out and locate pitches when I needed to,” Jackson said. “Having great defense behind you, it always makes the game a little easier.” The offensive support, however, was virtually non-existent behind Jackson, who has no-decisions in six of eight starts this season. He’s yielded three runs or fewer in five of those outings, and he’s pitched at least five innings in every start. In the Nationals most recent trip, Jackson started twice and left each game with the lead. Washington was one out from winning each time but gave up game-ending homers. “Like I said a thousand times, offense comes and goes,” Jackson said when asked about his teammates’ lack of production. “More times than not, if we keep pitching the way we’re pitching, we’ll win more games. Theses guys here, they practice real hard, and everybody’s out there having the best ABs they can.” The Nationals managed one extra-base hit against the Orioles, that coming on Ian Desmond’s sixth-inning homer to tie the score at 1. It was the sixth time this season Washington has scored one run or been shutout. This latest case of offensive failure comes with the Nationals missing several starters who potent bats, including outfielder Michael Morse, and right fielder Jayson Werth. “Through nine innings or so, I think we hit one ball hard,” Manager Davey Johnson said. “We had chances. A game like that’s frustrating. That was a tough one. [Jackson] pitched good. I thought the bullpen pitched good.

Article: 0 Woman responds to rude note left on car in veteran parking spot      CONCORD, N.C. - A local veteran is fighting back after she received an anonymous note in a Harris Teeter parking lot.      The note said, \\"this parking is for veterans lady, Learn to read and have some respect.\\"      Rebecca Landis Hayes of Concord posted on Facebook:      \\"To the person who left this note on my windshield today at the Coddle Creek Harris Teeter in Concord, NC:      I know I parked in one of the Veteran Parking spaces today, it was hot. I had been in and out of my car several times already this afternoon, and I was only going to be a minute. Besides, the parking lot was full, so I just did it. It was the first time, and I won't do it again. I'm sorry…      I'm sorry that you can't see my eight years of service in the United Sates Navy. I'm sorry that your narrow misogynistic world view can't conceive of the fact that there are female Veterans. I'm sorry that I have to explain myself to people like you. Mostly, I'm sorry that we didn't get a chance to have this conversation face to face, and that you didn't have the integrity and intestinal fortitude to identify yourself, qualities the military emphasizes.      Which leads to one question, 'I served, did you?'\\"      Hayes’ message is viral on social media.      A local veterans group in Concord said the note left on Hayes' car is disrespectful and sickening.      \\"There's no reason for something like this that gives everybody a bad name,\\" Ken Bratton, a veteran, said.      Workers at the Harris Teeter apologized to Hayes on behalf of the person who wrote the note.      Harris Teeter released the following statement:      Harris Teeter is proud to support our country’s troops and veterans. The company introduced “Reserved for Veterans” parking spaces in October 2014 as a special way to say “thank you” to our veterans, and we love the positive feedback our shoppers often share with us about these spaces.      It is unfortunate anyone would receive a note like this, and we are certainly disappointed it happened while this veteran was shopping in our store. We have reached out to Rebecca directly to thank her for her service as well as invite her to our Coddle Creek Harris Teeter this Friday, so we can offer a small token of our appreciation.      If she is available to join us, I would like to invite you, too, Joe (Bruno.)      We will have USO-NC President John Falkenbury on hand to speak about the importance of supporting our troops and veterans as well as offer a token of appreciation to our shopper.      I would also like to mention that Harris Teeter just completed its Support Our Troops donation card campaign on May 31.      Our generous shoppers and associates helped us raise nearly 800,000 in just 30 days to support our troops, veterans and their families. One hundred percent of all funds collected during Support Our Troops will be donated to local USO chapters throughout the areas in which Harris Teeter does business.

But some businesses take it a bit further with designated parking for other members of the community, such as expectant mothers and veterans.      A Concord woman parked in one of those spots Monday at the Coddle Creek Harris Teeter in Concord.      When she returned from shopping, she found a note on her vehicle that read, \\"This parking is for veterans, lady. Learn to read & have some respect.\\"      That woman, Rebecca Landis Hayes, took to Facebook to respond to the anonymous note writer:      To the person who left this note on my windshield today at the Coddle Creek Harris Teeter in Concord, NC:      I know I parked in one of the Veteran Parking spaces today, it was hot.

Which leads to one question, I served, did you?      By Monday night, the post had been shared on Facebook nearly 1000 times. Hayes tells WCNC.com that the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Hayes also says Harris Teeter reached out to her on Monday to apologize for what happened at their store.      Thoughts on the note and Hayes' response? Weigh in on Facebook and Twitter.      Copyright 2016 WCNC ||||| Notice      You must log in to continue. ||||| What was meant to be a scathing note in support of the troops left on a windshield ended up just being a sexist and incorrect rant.      Anyone who has ever struggled to find an open parking space on a hot day can understand the frustration and temptation to grab a specialized spot. Especially if you need to run in for just a minute. But when Rebecca Landis Hayes decided to park in the veterans only parking spot at Coddle Creek Harris Teeter in Concord, North Carolina, on Monday, she was fully entitled to do so because she served in the United States Navy for eight years.      However, when Hayes returned to her vehicle after leaving the store, she found a note on her windshield, shaming her for parking in the dedicated spot.      \\"This parking is for Veterans, lady. Learn to read and have some respect,\\" the note read.      So Hayes posted a photo of the note to Facebook, and wrote a response to the person who left it on her windshield.

The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.  Question: \\"Who was the first to exploit the commercial potential of the region and who was the admiral who took charge?\\" Response: \\"Admiral Cheng\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question.

Output:","output":"To provide an output for this task, I need to understand the content of this tweet and analyze its stance on the issue of Catalonia's independence. Given that the tweet is in Catalan, the first step is to translate it to English. Step 1: Translate the tweet from Catalan to English. Using an AI translation model like Google Translate or DeepL, I'll get the following translation: \\"RT @EnricMillo: @3gerardpique Don't defame my name man .., I have never insulted you.\\" Given this translation, I can now attempt to assign it to one of the three categories: Against, Favor, or Neutral. Step 2: Analyze the stance of the tweet. The statement appears to be a personal comment aimed at another user, rather than an expression of opinion about Catalonia's independence. It does not criticize Catalonia's independence (Against), nor does it support it (Favor), and it is not merely stating information or news.  Therefore, the next step will be  Step 3:\\tAssign the tweet to the 'Neutral' category. Since the tweet isn't explicitly supporting or opposing the idea of Catalonia's independence, it could be categorized as 'Neutral'.

Rather, it is Lord Voldemort, otherwise known as Tom Marvolo Riddle, who is the main antagonist. Lord Voldemort is an extremely powerful and dangerous Dark Wizard. He was considered by many, including Albus Dumbledore and Harry himself, to be the most dangerous Dark Wizard in history, surpassing even Gellert Grindelwald. Such was the fear Voldemort inspired, that most witches and wizards dared not utter his name, instead referring to him with such monikers as \\"You-Know-Who,\\" \\"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,\\" or \\"The Dark Lord.\\" This fear is so pervasive that it extends to the magical community’s everyday life, causing them to shy away from even mentioning his name. In part, it could be seen as people attempting to control their own fear, as giving a villain a name can give the illusion of making them real or empowering them further. Only a handful of characters, notably Harry Potter himself and Albus Dumbledore, Professor of Hogwarts School, have the courage to address Voldemort by his name. Dumbledore in particular emphasized the danger in giving too much power to fear, noteably reminding others that 'fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.' Harry Potter, the series' titular character, is often known as \\"The Boy Who Lived\\", because he survived an attempted murder by Voldemort as an infant — an act that led to Voldemort's first downfall, due to the powerful protection left by his mother's sacrifice. Consequently, while Harry Potter’s name has significance, emotions, and weight of its own within the series, and can be powerful to say and hear, it is not considered a name to be feared or avoided. Instead, it is Voldemort's name that is seen as one that cannot, or should not, be said."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First we did dinner, then karaoke in the BIG room, which was a blast.  My issue was our waitress. We were there on a Tuesday night and we were some of the only people in the place, so the excuse \\"it was just really busy\\" doesn't apply.  A couple of us ordered Hot Rock dinners, which were supposed to come with rice. Our meals came with no rice and when we brought it up to the waitress, the following conversation ensued:  Us: Hi, I think our meal is supposed to come with rice, right?

Most of us have a favorite toy from childhood that still has the power to make us smile, whether it's a Barbie doll, a Micro Machine or the board game Operation. What makes them memorable is the subject of a new book, \\"Toy Time! From Hula Hoops to He-Man to Hungry Hungry Hippos,\\" a collection of some of the most beloved toys of the 20th century. Author Christopher Byrne crowd-sourced the compilation from readers of the popular website TimetoPlayMag.com and came up with more than 100 beloved toys. The book includes not just the most popular choices, such as Big Wheels and the Etch a Sketch, but also those that prompted the most compelling memories, serving as \\"a catalyst for the imagination,\\" Byrne said. Most of our favorite toys came into our lives when we were developing our identity and figuring out the world, he said. Some, like the rampaging dinosaur King Zor (1962), have faded from the cultural landscape, while others, like View-Master and Nok Hockey (which both hit the mass market in the 1940s), have been passed down through generations. The toys that stick with us are those that allowed us to explore new worlds and create experiences. \\"Ultimately, play is something that happens in the imagination,\\" said Byrne, content director of TimetoPlayMag.com. \\"What makes each Barbie doll unique is how a little girl creates and projects her sense of self and her fantasies onto that piece of plastic.\\" Other toys create strong memories simply because of their nostalgic appeal. \\"Some, just by looking at them, reflect the design sensibility of the time, becoming almost works of art,\\" he said. \\"We identify with them in the cultural context of their time.\\" So, how can you tell if a toy will be a hit for your child? When it comes to gift-giving for children, the most important rule of thumb is to know who you're shopping for, Byrne said. \\"The hot toys are only hot if they're hot for your child,\\" he said. \\"The toys that become memorable are the ones that connect with our interests.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1. The new book \\"Toy Time! From Hula Hoops to He-Man to Hungry Hungry Hippos\\" collects memories of the most beloved toys from the 20th century. The author, Christopher Byrne, sourced information from readers of TimetoPlayMag.com and included over 100 popular toys in the compilation.   2. Toys featured in the book include popular favorites like Big Wheels and the Etch a Sketch, as well as toys that incited compelling memories. Some once-popular toys like the dinosaur 'King Zor' have faded with time, while others like View-Master and Nok Hockey have been shared across generations. 3. The most memorable toys are often those which enabled children to explore new worlds and create unique experiences. It's not just the toys themselves but what a child imagines and projects onto them that makes them unique, e.g. a Barbie doll. 4. To find a toy that will likely be memorable for a child, it is crucial to match the toy with the child's interests and personality. Popular \\"hot\\" toys may not necessarily be the best choice if they do not resonate with a specific child. 5. Toys also evoke nostalgia and serve as a reflection of design sensibilities and the cultural context of their time, making them almost like works of art.

Objects that move in uniform circular motion all have an acceleration toward the center of the circle and therefore, they must also suffer a force toward the center of the circle. That force is the centripetal force. For orbiting satellites, such as the moon orbiting the earth or the earth orbiting the sun, the centripetal force is produced by gravity. When an Olympic hammer thrower whirls a massive ball on a chain, the centripetal force is created by the athlete and transmitted by the chain.  What is an answer for this question: Given Adam stops swinging the bucket, will its centripetal acceleration increase or decrease? The answer is:","output":"If Adam stops swinging the bucket, its centripetal acceleration will decrease to zero. This is because centripetal acceleration is directly related to centripetal force, which keeps the water in the bucket while it's spinning. When Adam stops spinning the bucket, the centripetal force is no longer acting upon the water, causing the centripetal acceleration to decrease."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Patricia eventually had to have an artificial hip put in, unlike Rachel, because","output":"Patricia eventually had to have an artificial hip put in, unlike Rachel, because her worsening hip joint arthritis became too severe to manage with non-surgical interventions. This decision was made after assessing Patricia's quality of life, level of pain, and her ability to engage in daily activities. Over time, the cartilage in Patricia's hip joint had worn down significantly due to prolonged wear and tear, causing bones to grind against each other, which led to chronic pain and stiffness. This is in contrast to Rachel, whose hip arthritis remained within a manageable scope with minimal impact on her daily life. Several factors contributed to Patricia's case becoming significantly severe than Rachel's. Age played a major role in the progression of hip joint arthritis in Patricia's case, as the chances of developing osteoarthritis – the most common form of hip arthritis – increases as one gets older. Furthermore, Patricia had an elevated body mass index (BMI) – a condition that put additional stress on her hip joint, exacerbating her arthritis and causing the cartilage to degrade more rapidly. Conversely, Rachel maintained a healthy weight and was more proactive in her management of arthritis by engaging in regular exercise, which helped to strengthen the muscles around the hip joint, thus providing better support and reducing joint stress. Another factor that set Patricia's situation apart from Rachel's was her genetic predisposition to developing hip joint arthritis. Patricia had a family history of arthritis, with several close family members also having experienced similar joint issues, suggesting that she might have had an increased susceptibility to this degenerative condition. On the other hand, Rachel's family history did not indicate any predisposition to developing arthritis, allowing her to maintain relatively good hip joint health as she aged. Moreover, Patricia experienced a serious hip joint injury years prior to developing arthritis. This injury caused damage to the joint's cartilage and underlying bone structure, leading to a higher likelihood of developing arthritis in the affected joint later in life. Rachel, however, had never sustained any hip injuries, giving her joint a better chance of staying healthy as she aged. Before resorting to a hip replacement surgery, Patricia tried various non-invasive treatments to alleviate her pain and improve her joint function, which included pain-relief medications, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes. Though these treatments were somewhat helpful initially, their effects gradually diminished as Patricia's hip joint condition deteriorated. In contrast, Rachel was able to successfully manage her milder hip arthritis symptoms through these non-invasive approaches. She employed a combination of medication, exercise, and weight management measures to alleviate her pain, reduce inflammation, and preserve her joint function. These measures allowed Rachel to stave off the need for artificial hip replacement surgery, at least for the foreseeable future. As a result, Patricia underwent a total hip replacement surgery to address the debilitating pain and loss of function she experienced in her hip joint. During this procedure, the damaged hip joint was replaced with an artificial joint made of metal, plastic, or ceramic components that mimic the natural movement of the joint. The surgery proved to be a success, as Patricia experienced significant pain relief, improved mobility, and an overall enhancement in her quality of life. Patricia eventually had to have an artificial hip put in, unlike Rachel, because her arthritis had become too severe and the benefits of surgery vastly outweighed the risks, providing her with a much-needed opportunity to regain a sense of normalcy in her day-to-day life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The duo who created \\"The Bedsit Tapes\\" came to prominence in the 1980s. The Bedsit Tapes refers to a collection of recordings made in a bedsit—an apartment typically consisting of one room that serves as a bedroom, living room, and kitchen. These recordings featured various musical styles such as experimental, electronic, post-punk, and indie pop and were made by the musical duo that gained popularity during this decade. The 1980s was a time of rapid change and innovation, both politically and culturally. The decade saw the rise of alternative music genres like post-punk, new wave, and electronic music as well as the continued popularity of mainstream genres like pop and rock. The decade was characterized by the rise of music videos, the introduction of the compact disc, and increasingly sophisticated production techniques. In turn, this period gave rise to a wealth of new artists and bands exploring new sounds and ideas. One important factor contributing to the independent music scene of the 1980s was the advent of affordable home recording equipment, including four-track cassette recorders, which enabled budding musicians to experiment and create music without the need for costly studio time. This accessibility allowed a range of bedroom musicians, such as the duo behind The Bedsit Tapes, to record and distribute their music to a broader audience, often through self-produced cassettes or via independent record labels, which grew rapidly in number during the decade. The duo who created The Bedsit Tapes demonstrated a spirit of independence and a desire to create music outside the constraints of the mainstream music industry. Their tapes showcased an eclectic mix of sounds and genres, reflecting the vibrant and diverse musical environment of the 1980s. By embracing home recording and making their work available to a growing audience, this creative duo managed to capture the attention of both music lovers and critics alike, ultimately leaving an indelible mark on the cultural landscape of the decade."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease.  I am facing a new situation today: Nicholas works in pest control, and needs to have a steady supply of nitrogen gas for his tools. He always keeps a  closed container of nitrogen gas in his freezer, where the temperature is very low.  Nicholas's neighbor, Justin, likes to grill in his backyard.

Article: (Reuters) - Hundreds of victims of the Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas filed five lawsuits on Monday in a California court against the operators of the hotel from which the gunman fired, the organizers of the country music festival he targeted and the killer’s estate.      A hat rests on flowers in a makeshift memorial during a vigil marking the one-week anniversary of the October 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada U.S. October 8, 2017. REUTERS/Las Vegas Sun/Steve Marcus      The largest of the lawsuits was filed on behalf of 450 people who were either injured in or witnessed the shooting, while the other four were brought by families of people who were killed or severely injured.      All five cases were filed in Los Angeles Superior Court.      Muhammad Aziz, a Houston-based lawyer heading the lawsuits, said they were filed in California because nearly all the plaintiffs were from the state and had been treated there. He noted that Live Nation Entertainment Inc, the event organizer, was a California-based company.      Stephen Paddock, 64, fired into the crowd gathered for the Route 91 Harvest Festival from a 32nd-floor hotel suite at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas on Oct. 1, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more, the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Paddock also killed himself.      The victims accused the hotel operator MGM Resorts International and its subsidiary Mandalay Corp, which owns the hotel, of failing to properly monitor Paddock’s activities, train staff members and employ adequate security measures.      The festival goers also alleged Live Nation was negligent for failing to provide adequate exits and properly train staff for an emergency.      Several lawsuits have previously been filed in the shooting, mostly in Nevada state court. One of those filed on Monday was brought by college student Paige Gasper, who brought the first lawsuit over the mass shooting.      Gasper voluntarily dismissed the Nevada lawsuit on Friday.      Live Nation and MGM did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The companies have previously declined to comment on lawsuits.      Plaintiffs also sued the shooter’s estate for battery and assault. The reportedly wealthy shooter is thought to have had multimillion-dollar real estate investments across Texas and California.      A court hearing about who will be appointed to administer Paddock’s estate is set for Dec. 7.      Slide Fire Solutions, the maker of the so-called bump stock device Paddock used to achieve a near-automatic rate of fire, was named in previous lawsuits over the shooting, but not in any of the suits filed on Monday.      Aziz said Slide Fire was not named because most of his clients supported the right to bear arms.      “We want to focus on hotel and venue security, not turn this into a gun rights case,” he said. ||||| Hundreds Of Victims Of Las Vegas Shooting File Lawsuits      Enlarge this image toggle caption Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images      Hundreds of victims of the Oct. 1 shooting in Las Vegas filed five lawsuits in Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday.      The largest of the suits names 450 plaintiffs. Among those being sued are MGM Resorts International, owner of the Mandalay Bay resort; Live Nation, organizer of the country music festival at which 58 people were killed; and the estate of Stephen Paddock, the shooter.      The victims claim negligence by both MGM and Live Nation. They accuse MGM of not having adequate security policies, not properly training staff, not properly surveilling the premises, and failing to respond quickly when security guard Jesus Campos was shot. The suit alleges that Paddock's VIP status as a high-stakes gambler gave him access to a service elevator at the Mandalay Bay, which he used to stockpile weapons and ammunition in the days before the shooting.      In Live Nation's case, the plaintiffs say the company failed to provide enough exits or properly train employees \\"in case of a foreseeable event, such as a terrorist attack or other emergency.\\"      The shooter's estate is being sued for assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.      The attorney heading the lawsuits, Muhammad Aziz, told Reuters that the cases were filed in California because most of the plaintiffs are from that state and received treatment there. He also noted that Live Nation is based in the state.      Last week, a different law firm filed 14 suits in Nevada court. In addition to MGM, Live Nation, and Paddock's estate, these suits also name the manufacturers of the bump stock devices found in Paddock's hotel suite. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argue that the shooting could have been stopped, and that the lawsuits are intended to prompt policy changes so it can't happen again.      Similar to the California lawsuits, the suits filed in Nevada argue that MGM assisted Paddock in transporting his arsenal by giving him access to a service elevator not open to the public, and that the Mandalay Bay failed to adequately monitor the hotel premises, discover his weapons, have gunshot detection devices in hotel rooms, or have adequate procedures to handle an active shooter situation. The suit alleges that Live Nation failed to provide adequate exits or properly train staff to handle emergencies.      \\"The evidence we've seen thus far clearly indicates that the defendants were culpable in contributing to the 58 victims who lost their lives and the thousands more still suffering from severe injuries that will take years to overcome, if ever,\\" said attorney Antonio Romanucci in a press release. He is also lead counsel in lawsuits related to the 2016 shooting at Orlando's Pulse nightclub.      Live Nation told NPR that it does not typically comment on ongoing litigation.      MGM wrote in a statement to NPR: \\"The incident that took place on October 1st was a terrible tragedy perpetrated by an evil man. These kinds of lawsuits are not unexpected and we intend to defend ourselves against them. That said, out of respect for the victims, we will give our response through the appropriate legal channels.\\"      It won't be easy to prove the venues were negligent.      \\"One can't blame the hotel for not predicting that this gunman would go up to their 32nd floor with an arsenal and break out the windows and start firing at people,\\" Tom Russell, a personal injury lawyer and law professor at the University of Denver told NPR's Kirk Siegler. He said venues can also be victims, in the form of lost business or other harms.      As Kirk reported last month, victims sued the theater chain Cinemark after the 2012 Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting. But the victims lost their suit, and were ordered to pay Cinemark's legal fees. A legal expert also said that lawsuits against the gun industry tend to be unsuccessful.      \\"Laws like the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act passed as recently as 2005 broadly exempt the gun industry from any tort lawsuits when criminals use their products,\\" Kirk reported. \\"Meanwhile some victims, as in one motion already filed in Las Vegas, go after the gunman's assets. But even if they win, there's rarely enough money to go around.\\"      C. Chad Pinkerton, an attorney in the California suits, told the Associated Press that the shooting could have been avoided if officials had implemented safety recommendations and followed the weapons policies they had.      \\"We know in this day and age that evil does happen, and we have to protect against that,\\" he told the AP. \\"This was the largest venue security failure in U.S. history.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Hundreds of victims of the October 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas filed five lawsuits in a California court against hotel operator MGM Resorts International, the organizers of the country music festival Live Nation Entertainment Inc., and the shooter's estate.

Answer the following question: Background: Fish mortality is a parameter used in fisheries population dynamics to account for the loss of fish in a fish stock through death. The mortality can be divided into two types:  Natural mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to causes not associated with fishing. Such causes can include disease, competition, cannibalism, old age, predation, pollution or any other natural factor that causes the death of fish. In fisheries models natural mortality is denoted by (M).[1] Fishing mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to fishing activities using any fishing gear.[1] It is denoted by (F) in fisheries models.  Paragraph: The fisherman had 2 choices: he could go to Silver Lake situated at a higher altitude and fish there; or he could go to Red lake, a few miles further down the road. Both lakes were natural, but Red Lake had a few pollution problems last year, and the oxygen levels in the water decreased, leading to many fish dying. Silver lake was still pristine, untouched by human activities such as pollution.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which lake is situated at a lower altitude? Answer:","output":"Red Lake is situated at a lower altitude. The paragraph mentions that the fisherman had two choices: going to Silver Lake, which was situated at a higher altitude, or going to Red Lake, which is further down the road. By stating that Silver Lake is at a higher altitude, it implies that Red Lake is at a lower altitude in comparison. Additionally, the paragraph also discusses the pollution problems that Red Lake faced last year, which could be related to its position at a lower altitude as human activities and pollution might have more impact on lower-lying bodies of water. In contrast, Silver Lake is described as pristine and untouched by human activities such as pollution, possibly due to its higher altitude that might help protect it from some of the negative impacts of human presence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There are hundreds of colleges that are \\"test optional\\" which means students can choose not to release their test scores in the application process. Admission decisions at these colleges for students who do not submit their test scores are made based on other factors. A list of test optional colleges can be found atfairtest.org. It is important, however, to make sure that the college is the right fit academically regardless of the test optional policy. You also asked if your daughter should write about her disability and if this would hurt her chances of being admitted.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. You are given a new situation: Mike was interested in the science behind polar compounds. To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid.  and a hint : Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds.  Please answer this question : Which compound would have higher boiling point, compound A or compound B? Answer:","output":"Compound A, the polar compound, would have a higher boiling point compared to compound B, the nonpolar compound. This is because polar compounds form weak hydrogen bonds between molecules, which require additional energy to break apart.

Answer the following question: Article: In the past, people who graduated from college felt proud of their academic achievements and confident that their degree would help them to find a good job.   However, in the past four years the job market has changed greatly. This year's college graduates are facing one of the worst job markets. For example, Ryan Stewart, a graduate of San Jose State University, got a degree in religious studies, but he has not gotten any job offers. He points out that many people already working are getting laid off and don't have jobs, so it's even harder for new college graduates to find jobs.   Four years ago, the future looked bright for his class of 2006. There were many high-tech(\\"dot com\\") job opportunities, graduates received many job offers, and they were able to get jobs with high salaries and benefits such as health insurance and paid vacations. However, \\"Times have changed. It's a new market,\\" according to an officer of the university.   The officer says students who do find jobs started preparing two years ago. They worked during summer vacations, they have had several short-time jobs, and they majored in fields that are still paying well, such as accounting or nursing.   Even teaching is not a secure profession now. Ryan Stewart wanted to be a teacher. But instead he will probably go back to school in order to become a college teacher. He thinks college teaching could be a good career even in a bad economy.   In conclusion, these days a college degree does not automatically lead to a good job with a high salary. Some students can only hope that the value of their degree will increase in the future. Question: What did a college degree mean to people in the past? Yes or no, is the answer \\"It built up their confidence in the job market.\\"? Answer:","output":"In the past, a college degree held significant meaning for graduates. It was a source of pride for their academic achievements and instilled a sense of confidence in their ability to secure a good job in the market. So yes, the answer is \\"It built up their confidence in the job market.\\"  A college degree was often viewed as a ticket to a stable career with high-paying job opportunities, along with benefits such as health insurance and paid vacations. The job market was more favorable for graduates, with many high-tech and \\"dot com\\" companies offering numerous positions to new degree holders. Therefore, a college degree was seen as a valuable asset, paving the way to a successful professional life. However, as mentioned in the article, the job market has undergone significant changes in the past four years, with recent college graduates facing one of the worst job markets in recent times. This has led to a shift in the perception of a college degree and the confidence it once instilled in graduates. The current job market is much more competitive, and even those who have been working for years are facing layoffs and job losses, making it even harder for new college graduates to find suitable job opportunities. The article points out that students now have to start preparing for jobs several years ahead, by participating in internships and lining up part-time jobs during summer vacations. Additionally, it is increasingly important to choose majors that are still in high demand, such as accounting or nursing, to boost the chances of finding a well-paying job after graduation. Even traditionally secure professions like teaching are no longer guaranteed to offer stable career paths. In conclusion, while a college degree in the past provided graduates with a heightened level of confidence in the job market, the current state of the job landscape has made this less certain. A college degree does not automatically guarantee a high-paying job anymore, and students must now strategically plan their education and career choices to optimize the value of their degrees in the increasingly competitive job market."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: – All eyes have been on Reunion Island these past few days, but some of the action has now shifted to Paris following Saturday's arrival of a piece of debris believed to possibly be from MH370. USA Today reports that military aviation and legal experts will on Wednesday begin their inquiry; today, French and Malaysian investigators will meet with an investigating judge. While a determination of whether the part belonged to the missing plane appears days off, Reuters is digging into a possible clue-on-a-clue: If the debris does belong to the missing Malaysia Airlines flight, what appear to be goose or stalk barnacles affixed to it could reveal some of the plane's secrets. An analysis of their shells and their positioning on the debris could allow scientists to make determinations about the \\"temperature and chemical composition\\" of the water the barnacles traveled through and how the debris moved through it (ie, above water or submerged); from there, their source can be pinpointed—in a general way, at least. An Australia PhD student whose focus is the shell chemistry of barnacles suggests the best they could do is narrow the search area to, at the least, tens of kilometers. Still, \\"it's very powerful stuff,\\" William Newman, a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, tells Bloomberg News: Indeed, barnacles have been used to study the movement patterns of whales and turtles, have given up shipwreck secrets, provided info on enemy ships in WWII, and have even factored into murder investigations. Newman says he once helped police examine barnacles found on a body bag and skull.

Now, people think they might have found a piece of it on Reunion Island. That's a small island really far off the east coast of Africa. But they're not sure if it's really from the missing plane, so they decided to take it all the way over to Paris to check it out. There, experts who know all about airplanes, and people who know all the rules about things like this, will start trying to find some answers on Wednesday. But before they do that, people from France and Malaysia who are really good at solving mysteries will meet with a person called an investigating judge. This is a person whose job is to make sure everything is done right in an investigation. Finding out whether this piece is really from the missing airplane might take a few days. But in the meantime, the investigators might have found a clue right on this big piece of debris. Do you know what barnacles are? They are little creatures, like small shells, that stick to things in the water!  They found some barnacles that could be from a goose or stalk on the debris. Now, these barnacles might be able to help solve the mystery. By looking really closely at the shells and where they are located on the debris, scientists can find out interesting things like how warm the water was where the barnacles came from, or what kind of stuff was in the water. They can also figure out whether the debris was above the water or under it. This could help them guess where the debris and barnacles came from. Isn't that super clever? Someone who is studying these little barnacles for their big school project said that this could help them find the area where the plane is, which would make the search a lot easier. This could even make the search area tens of kilometers smaller. Which is a lot! A clever professor called William Newman, who works at a place where they learn about the ocean, says that this could be very, very helpful. Barnacles have helped scientists study how whales and turtles move, told us secrets of ships that sank a long time ago, and gave details about enemy ships in a big war a long time ago. They even helped solve some crimes! Professor Newman once helped the police look at barnacles that were found on a bag and a skull.

It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).  - The froghoppers, or the superfamily Cercopoidea, are a group of Hemipteran insects, in the suborder Auchenorrhyncha. Adults are capable of jumping many times their height and length, giving the group their common name, but they are best known for their plant-sucking nymphs which encase themselves in froth in springtime.  - Baissa is a lower Cretaceous locality in Siberia, on the left bank of the Vitim River. The Zaza Formation sediments exposed at Baissa are represented mostly by sandstones, siltstones, marls and bituminous shales. The total thickness if the section is about 80 m. Insect remains occur throughout the section, except for the most coarse-grained rocks. Their abundance and state of preservation vary from one bed to another.  - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period.   - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.  - Saurophthirus is an extinct genus of flea that represents a transition between primitive stem fleas , and modern species . The type species , S. longipes is found in early Cretaceous strata of Baissa , Siberia . The second species , S. exquisitus , is from the is from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation .  - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.  - A larva (plural \\"larvae\\" ) is a distinct juvenile form many animals undergo before metamorphosis into adults. Animals with indirect development such as insects, amphibians, or cnidarians typically have a larval phase of their life cycle.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - Warm-blooded animal species can maintain a body temperature higher than their environment. In particular, homeothermic species maintain a stable body temperature by regulating metabolic processes. The only known homeotherms are birds and mammals. Other species have various degrees of thermoregulation.  - Fleas are small flightless insects that form the order Siphonaptera. They are external parasites of warm-blooded animals, living by hematophagy off the blood of mammals and birds. The adults are up to about long and usually brown. They are flattened sideways to enable them to move through their host's fur or feathers, and have strong claws to prevent themselves from being dislodged. They are wingless insects, with mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood and hind legs adapted for jumping.

Question: what happens to the luthers Movie title: Superman IV: The Quest For Peace Movie plot: Superman saves a spaceship of cosmonauts whose ship was thrown off course by debris, then visits his home-town of Smallville as Clark. Now that his adoptive parents have died, Clark has inherited their now-unattended farm. In an empty barn, he uncovers the capsule that brought him to Earth, and removes a luminescent green Kryptonian energy module. A recording left by his mother Lara states that its power can be used only once. Unwilling to sell the farm to a mall developer, Superman returns to Metropolis, where he stops a runaway Subway Train after the conductor collapses at the Controls. After returning to the Daily Planet, Clark learns that the newspaper went bankrupt and has been taken over by David Warfield, a tabloid tycoon who fires Perry White and hires his own daughter Lacy as the new editor. Lacy takes a liking to Clark and tries to seduce him. Clark agrees to go on a date with her. Following the news that the United States and the Soviet Union may engage in nuclear war, Clark is conflicted about how much Superman should intervene. After receiving a letter from a concerned schoolboy, Superman travels to the Fortress of Solitude to seek advice from the spirits of his Kryptonian ancestors. They recommend that he let Earth solve its own problems, or seek new worlds where war has been outlawed. After asking for advice from Lois Lane, Superman attends a meeting of the United Nations, announcing to the assembly that he will rid the planet of nuclear weapons. Various nations fire their nuclear warheads into space, which are collected by Superman into a giant net and then thrown into the sun. Meanwhile, young Lenny Luthor breaks his uncle Lex Luthor out of prison. Returning to Metropolis, Lex and Lenny steal a strand of Superman's hair from a museum, and create a genetic matrix which Lex attaches to a U.S. nuclear missile.

Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,\\" Lex Luthor, the main antagonist, escapes from prison with the help of his nephew, Lenny Luthor. Lex steals a strand of Superman's hair from a museum and creates a genetic matrix, which he attaches to a U.S. nuclear missile. When the missile is launched as a test, Superman intercepts it and throws it into the sun. As a result, a glowing ball of energy is discharged and forms a superhuman being named Nuclear Man, whose sole purpose is to kill Superman. Nuclear Man and Superman engage in an epic battle, during which Nuclear Man unleashes destruction around the world. Superman lures him to the dark side of the moon, where Nuclear Man loses his powers due to the absence of sunlight. Superman takes advantage of this and traps Nuclear Man on the moon's surface. However, he escapes and kidnaps Lacy Warfield, who he views as his potential bride. Superman saves Lacy, and the battle resumes on Earth. In the final confrontation, Superman learns that Nuclear Man's powers weaken in the shadows and that he gains strength from the sun. Superman defeats Nuclear Man by foiling his solar energy absorption, causing him to wither and become powerless. Superman then flies him into a nuclear reactor, which ultimately destroys him. After the battle, Superman gives a speech at the United Nations, acknowledging that he cannot eliminate all the world's nuclear weapons. He urges the nations to find a peaceful resolution to their conflicts and disarm their nuclear arsenals on their own. In the movie's subplot, Clark Kent (Superman's alter ego) faces his own difficulties as the Daily Planet newspaper is taken over by tabloid tycoon David Warfield. Warfield fires Perry White and hires his daughter, Lacy, as the new editor. Throughout the movie, Lacy takes a liking to Clark, trying to seduce him and even going on a date with him. However, Clark's alter ego, Superman, is the main focus of the plot, and his personal life takes a back seat to his responsibility as a superhero. To summarize, \\"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\\" is centered on Superman's mission to rid the world of nuclear weapons. Along the way, he faces challenges from Lex Luthor and the newly created adversary, Nuclear Man, who he ultimately defeats. Despite his efforts, Superman admits that he cannot single-handedly eliminate all nuclear threats and instead urges the world to take responsibility for disarming their weapons in the pursuit of peace."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Ever wonder why sometimes a hug is all you need ? You can't explain it , but there's just something comforting about being in your wife's arms after a rough day or giving mom a hug after a long time apart . A new study says the warm feeling in a hug is more than just skin deep . Researchers from the University of California , Berkeley believe that this loving feeling could have anti-aging benefits . Oxytocin , sometimes referred to as the \\" love hormone \\" or the \\" trust hormone , \\" is responsible for those indescribable feelings we get when we're bonding with a lover or a loved one . Levels of the hormone drop as we age , and evidence suggests that could be a contributing factor to the _ of our bodies as we age . Muscle loss in particular is one of the major side effects of aging , with our bodies losing up to 5 percent of our muscle mass each decade past our 30s . In the study , published in the journal Nature Communications , researchers injected oxytocin into older mice with muscle damage . The older mice had lower levels of the homeone than younger mice initially . But after nine days , the older mice who were given the hormone healed better than those who did not . In fact , their ability to repair muscle damage was up to 80 percent that of the younger mice . The results were not only fast-acting , but provide hope for future uses of the hormone in a variety of anti-aging capacities . \\" This is good because it demonstrates that extra oxytocin improves aged tissue stem cells without making muscle stem cells divide uncontrollably , \\" study co-author Wendy Cousins said in a statement . Previous uses of anti-aging molecules have also been associated with higher cancer risk , but researchers are hopeful that oxytocin can be useful in humans without this risk .

Select from the following. i. no. ii. yes. The answer is:","output":"The answer is i. no. Although these two questions may appear similar at first glance, they are not asking the same thing. Here is a detailed explanation of the differences: 1. \\"Why do we feel thirsty after eating biryani?\\" Biryani is a traditional South Asian mixed rice dish typically prepared using fragrant basmati rice, spices, meat, vegetables, and sometimes, eggs. This question is specifically concerned with why we tend to feel thirsty after consuming this particular dish. In this case, the main reasons people experience thirst after eating biryani include: a. High salt content: Biryani usually contains a considerable amount of salt, which enhances the flavor but also increases our body's sodium levels. As a result, our body needs to maintain fluid balance, and our brain triggers the thirst sensation to encourage us to drink water to replenish the lost body fluids and maintain a proper electrolyte balance. b. Spices: Biryani is known for its rich blend of spices, such as cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom, and so on. These spices often have a warming effect on the body, and as a result, the body seeks to cool down by drinking fluids. Additionally, spices can sometimes cause slight irritation in the throat or mouth, which might prompt us to drink water to soothe the discomfort. c. Dehydration from cooking: Depending on the cooking process, some types of biryani might lose a significant amount of water content. If this is the case, consuming the dish could lead to a temporary feeling of water deprivation in the body, inducing thirst. 2. \\"Why do we feel thirsty after eating?\\" This second question is a more general inquiry about why we tend to feel thirsty after consuming a meal, regardless of the dish. There are several factors that can contribute to thirst after eating, such as: a. Salt intake: Similar to the biryani, many dishes contain a high amount of salt. As mentioned earlier, this can increase our body's sodium levels, resulting in the need to maintain fluid balance, and thus, prompting thirst. b. Spicy and hot foods: Consuming spicy and warm foods can induce the body's need to hydrate and cool down, which usually leads to thirst. c. Foods rich in protein or carbohydrates: The digestion of protein and carbohydrates requires more water, so consuming meals high in these nutrients can lead to thirst as the body demands more fluids to aid in the digestive process. d. General dehydration: Dehydration is a common cause of thirst. Sometimes, we may not be drinking enough water throughout the day, and our body will use mealtime to signal the need for additional fluids. In conclusion, while both of these questions address the issue of post-meal thirst, they differ in their scope and focus. The first question is centered on the specific dish of biryani, while the second question is a broader inquiry into the various reasons why we may experience thirst after eating in general."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Paragraph: The surveillance and prevention of pathogenic microbiological contamination are the most important tasks of biosafety management in the lab. There is an urgent need to establish an effective and unbiased method to evaluate and monitor such contamination. This study aims to investigate the utility of next generation sequencing (NGS) method to detect possible contamination in the microbiology laboratory. Environmental samples were taken at multiple sites at the lab including the inner site of centrifuge rotor, the bench used for molecular biological tests, the benches of biosafety cabinets used for viral culture, clinical sample pre-treatment and nucleic acids extraction, by scrubbing the sites using sterile flocked swabs. The extracted total nucleic acids were used to construct the libraries for deep sequencing according to the protocol of Ion Torrent platform. At least 1G raw data was obtained for each sample. The reads of viruses and bacteria accounted for 0.01 ± 0.02%, and 77.76 ± 12.53% of total reads respectively. The viral sequences were likely to be derived from gene amplification products, the nucleic acids contaminated in fetal bovine serum. Reads from environmental microorganisms were also identified. Our results suggested that NGS method was capable of monitoring the nucleic acids contaminations from different sources in the lab, demonstrating its promising utility in monitoring and assessing the risk of potential laboratory contamination. The risk of contamination from reagents, remnant DNA and environment should be considered in data analysis and results interpretation.

A basketball coach who suffered a brain injury in a car crash that killed his fiancee just days before their wedding has shown 'miraculous' progress in hospital, family friends have said. John Redman, 25, was driving his bride-to-be, Brittany Huber, 23, from Dalton, Georgia to her hometown of Mobile, Alabama on April 28 when he lost control of his Lexus during a rainstorm. The car smashed into the median along Interstate 85 in Meriweather County Georgia, killing Huber on impact and leaving him with broken ribs and a head injury. Amid the tragedy of losing Huber, the families are overjoyed that Redman is showing progress by blinking, smiling and squeezing his hands. Hope: John Redman, who suffered a brain injury in the car crash that killed his wife-to-be Britanny Huber, left, has shown progress two weeks on by blinking, smiling and squeezing his hands. 'John had a miraculous day,' Derek Waugh, the director of athletics at Dalton State College, where Redman works, wrote on his CaringBridge page on Monday. 'He really did some amazing things with respect to cognitive function.' On Tuesday night he added: 'John has come so far in the last 2 days. A list of progress includes squeezing a mini-basketball, answering questions with multiple eye blinks, making movements on command, smiling at jokes and generally being \\"aware\\" of his surroundings and people.' 'These are amazing steps...He has a long road to healing ahead of him but what an amazing 2 days!!!!' Redman has been treated at Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital, but he is being moved to Sheperd Spinal Clinic, which specializes brain and spinal cord injuries. The. couple’s wedding was scheduled to take place in Huber’s hometown of. Mobile, Alabama, Saturday, and the pair were on their way there when the. fatal accident happened.

Wreckage: They were driving from Georgia to her hometown of Mobile, Alabama when Redman lost control of his car and smashed into the median, killing his fiancee on impact. Scene: He suffered a brain injury and broken bones in the crash, which occurred on May 28. According to officials, Redman was driving too fast, and the slick road conditions did not play a role in the crash. The church where the couple were due to marry on Saturday May 3 was instead the venue for her memorial service. Seven women wore matching mint green dresses - their bridesmaids dresses - to the service, AL.com's Tommy Hicks reported. Redman's.

A: As a result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, which limited the construction of new heavy surface combat ships, most early aircraft carriers were conversions of ships that were laid down (or had served) as different ship types: cargo ships, cruisers, battlecruisers, or battleships.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"A: Yes, the answer provided an overview of why ship conversions took place in the 1920s, but it is essential to discuss the specific types of aircraft carriers that arose from these conversions in 1927. In 1927, ship conversions mainly gave rise to two types of aircraft carriers: fleet carriers and light carriers. These were developed from existing battlecruisers, battleships, or other large vessels, with modifications made to accommodate aircraft launching and recovery capabilities. 1. Fleet Carriers: Fleet carriers were the largest and heaviest aircraft carriers of the time, possessing considerable aircraft storage, launch, and recovery capabilities. One prominent example of a fleet carrier conversion in the late 1920s was the United States' USS Lexington (CV-2) and USS Saratoga (CV-3), which were initially built as battlecruisers. Both were converted into aircraft carriers in response to limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. 2. Light Carriers: Light carriers were smaller in size compared to fleet carriers and typically had fewer aircraft storage and operational capabilities. However, they could maintain a faster pace in naval operations and had a broader range of strategic possibilities due to their higher speed and maneuverability. One example of a light carrier conversion during the 1920s was the Japanese carrier, Hosho, which was initially designed as a seaplane tender, but was converted into a light aircraft carrier by adding a full-length flight deck to her design. To summarize, the ship conversions in 1927 mainly gave rise to fleet carriers and light carriers, which were the result of adapting and retrofitting existing battlecruisers, battleships, or other large vessels in response to the limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. These converted aircraft carriers played a significant role in naval aviation and shaped the future of naval warfare."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Find the longest common substring in the strings A and B. uTwuwS, QJwuDV A:","output":"To find the longest common substring in the strings A and B, you can use the dynamic programming approach. In this case, A = 'uTwuwS' and B = 'QJwuDV'. Let's create a table (DP matrix) for dynamic programming, where its columns correspond to characters of A and rows correspond to characters of B. 1. Initialize an empty table with dimensions (length of A + 1) x (length of B + 1). \`\`\`python A = 'uTwuwS' B = 'QJwuDV' dp = [[0] * (len(A) + 1) for _ in range(len(B) + 1)] \`\`\` 2. Fill the table with the following logic: if the characters at a given position of A and B match, dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1, otherwise dp[i][j] = 0. \`\`\`python max_length = 0 end_position = 0 for i in range(1, len(B) + 1):     for j in range(1, len(A) + 1):         if B[i - 1] == A[j - 1]:             dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1             if dp[i][j] > max_length:                 max_length = dp[i][j]                 end_position = j         else:             dp[i][j] = 0 \`\`\` 3.

Question: Information:  - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.  - An explosive eruption is a volcanic term to describe a violent, explosive type of eruption. Mount St. Helens in 1980 was an example. Such eruptions result when sufficient gas has dissolved under pressure within a viscous magma such that expelled lava violently froths into volcanic ash when pressure is suddenly lowered at the vent. Sometimes a lava plug will block the conduit to the summit, and when this occurs, eruptions are more violent. Explosive eruptions can send rocks, dust, gas and pyroclastic material up to 20 km into the atmosphere at rate of up to 100,000 tonnes per second, traveling at several hundred meters per second. This cloud will then collapse, creating a pyroclastic flow of hot volcanic matter.  - A federal republic is a federation of states with a republican form of government. At its core, the literal meaning of the word republic when used to reference a form of government means: \\"a country that is governed by elected representatives and by an elected leader (such as a president) rather than by a king or queen\\".  - An effusive eruption is a type of volcanic eruption in which lava steadily flows out of a volcano onto the ground. Effusive eruption differs from explosive eruption, wherein magma is violently fragmented when expelled from a volcano. The shape of the lava flows created by effusive eruptions is governed by the type of lava, rate and duration of eruption, and slope of the surrounding areas.  - Bristol Bay (\\"Iilgayaq\\" in Central Yup'ik) is the eastern-most arm of the Bering Sea, at 57° to 59° North 157° to 162° West in Southwest Alaska. Bristol Bay is 400 km (250 mi) long and 290 km, (180 mi) wide at its mouth. A number of rivers flow into the bay, including the Cinder, Egegik, Igushik, Kvichak, Meshik, Nushagak, Naknek, Togiak, and Ugashik.  - The Alaska Peninsula is a peninsula extending about to the southwest from the mainland of Alaska and ending in the Aleutian Islands. The peninsula separates the Pacific Ocean from Bristol Bay, an arm of the Bering Sea.   - A shield volcano is a type of volcano usually built almost entirely of fluid lava flows. They are named for their low profile, resembling a warrior's shield lying on the ground. This is caused by the highly fluid lava they erupt, which travels farther than lava erupted from stratovolcanoes. This results in the steady accumulation of broad sheets of lava, building up the shield volcano's distinctive form. The shape of shield volcanoes is due to the low viscosity of their mafic lava.  - A caldera is a large cauldron-like depression that forms following the evacuation of a magma chamber/reservoir. When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time period, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at Bárðarbunga volcano in Iceland.  - Andesite (or ) is an extrusive igneous, volcanic rock, of intermediate composition, with aphanitic to porphyritic texture. In a general sense, it is the intermediate type between basalt and dacite, and ranges from 57 to 63% silicon dioxide (SiO) as illustrated in TAS diagrams. The mineral assemblage is typically dominated by plagioclase plus pyroxene or hornblende. Magnetite, zircon, apatite, ilmenite, biotite, and garnet are common accessory minerals. Alkali feldspar may be present in minor amounts. The quartz-feldspar abundances in andesite and other volcanic rocks are illustrated in QAPF diagrams.  - Mount Dutton is a stratovolcano in the Aleutian Range of the U.S. state of Alaska , on the Alaska Peninsula .  - The Bering Strait (\\"Beringov proliv\\", Yupik: \\"Imakpik\\") is a strait of the Pacific, which borders with the Arctic to north. It is located between Russia and the United States. Named after Vitus Bering, a Danish-born explorer in the service of the Russian Empire, it lies slightly south of the Arctic Circle being at about 65° 40' N latitude. The present Russia-US east-west boundary is at 168° 58' 37\\" W.  - Katmai National Park and Preserve is a United States National Park and Preserve in southern Alaska, notable for the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes and for its Alaskan brown bears. The park and preserve covers , being roughly the size of Wales. Most of this is a designated wilderness area in the national park where all hunting is banned, including over of land. The park is named after Mount Katmai, its centerpiece stratovolcano. The park is located on the Alaska Peninsula, across from Kodiak Island, with headquarters in nearby King Salmon, about southwest of Anchorage. The area was first designated a national monument in 1918 to protect the area around the major 1912 volcanic eruption of Novarupta, which formed the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, a , pyroclastic flow. The park includes as many as 18 individual volcanoes, seven of which have been active since 1900.  - The Bering Sea is a marginal sea of the Pacific Ocean. It comprises a deep water basin, which then rises through a narrow slope into the shallower water above the continental shelves.  - Russia (from the  Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.  - Wilderness or wildland is a natural environment on Earth that has not been significantly modified by civilized human activity. It may also be defined as: \\"The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planetthose last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure.\\"  - Rhyolite is an igneous, volcanic rock, of felsic (silica-rich) composition (typically > 69% SiOsee the TAS classification). It may have any texture from glassy to aphanitic to porphyritic. The mineral assemblage is usually quartz, sanidine and plagioclase (in a ratio > 2:1see the QAPF diagram). Biotite and hornblende are common accessory minerals. It is the extrusive equivalent to granite.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas.  - The Aleutian Range is a major mountain range located in southwest Alaska, and it extends from Chakachamna Lake (80 miles/130 km southwest of Anchorage) to Unimak Island, which is at the tip of the Alaska Peninsula. It includes all of the mountains of the peninsula, and what makes it so special is its large number of active volcanoes, which are also part of the larger Aleutian Arc. The mainland part of the range is about 600 miles (1000 km) long; the Aleutian Islands are (geologically) a partially submerged western extension of the range that stretches for another 1,600 km (1000 mi). However the official designation \\"Aleutian Range\\" includes only the mainland peaks and the peaks on Unimak Island. The range is almost entirely roadless wilderness, and Katmai National Park and Preserve, a large national park within the range, must be reached by boat or plane.  - Unimak Island is the largest island in the Aleutian Islands chain of the U.S. state of Alaska.  - The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean.  - Yukon (also commonly called the Yukon) is the westernmost and smallest of Canada's three federal territories (the other two are Northwest Territories and Nunavut). The territory is very sparsely populated with its about 35,000 people on almost half a million square kilometres. Whitehorse is the territorial capital and Yukon's only city.  - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from .   - In geology, felsic refers to igneous rocks that are relatively rich in elements that form feldspar and quartz. It is contrasted with mafic rocks, which are relatively richer in magnesium and iron. It refers to those rocks rich in silicate minerals, magma, and rocks which are enriched in the lighter elements such as silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, and potassium.  - Sovereignty is understood in jurisprudence as the full right and power of a governing body to govern itself without any interference from outside sources or bodies. In political theory, sovereignty is a substantive term designating supreme authority over some polity. It is a basic principle underlying the dominant Westphalian model of state foundation.  - Pumice, called pumicite in its powdered or dust form, is a volcanic rock that consists of highly vesicular rough textured volcanic glass, which may or may not contain crystals. It is typically light colored. Scoria is another vesicular volcanic rock that differs from pumice in having larger vesicles, thicker vesicle walls and being dark colored and denser.  - The Anchorage Metropolitan Statistical Area , as defined by the United States Census Bureau, is an area consisting of the Municipality of Anchorage and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough in the south central region of Alaska.  - British Columbia (BC) is the westernmost province of Canada, with a population of more than four million people located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains.  British Columbia is also a component of the Pacific Northwest and the Cascadia bioregion, along with the U.S. states of Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Alaska.  - Americans are citizens of the United States of America. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, Americans do not equate their nationality with ethnicity, but with citizenship and allegiance. Although citizens make up the majority of Americans, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim an American identity.  - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.  - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets.  - Alaska is a U.S. state located in the northwest extremity of North America. The Canadian administrative divisions of British Columbia and Yukon border the state to the east; its most extreme western part is Attu Island; it has a maritime border with Russia to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seasthe southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. Alaska is the largest state in the United States by area, the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 United States. Approximately half of Alaska's residents (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015) live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance. Military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy.  - The Aleutian Arc is a large volcanic arc in the U.S. state of Alaska. It consists of a number of active and dormant volcanoes that have formed as a result of subduction along the Aleutian Trench. Although taking its name from the Aleutian Islands, this term is a geologic grouping rather than a geographic one, and the Aleutian Arc extends through the Alaska Peninsula following the Aleutian Range to the Aleutian Islands.  - A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as .  - Attu is the westernmost and largest island in the Near Islands group of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, and the westernmost point of land relative to Alaska, the United States, North America and the Americas. The island became uninhabited in 2010.  - Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are normally caught in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. Fishing may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Magma (from Ancient Greek  (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock.  - Dacite is an igneous, volcanic rock. It has an aphanitic to porphyritic texture and is intermediate in composition between andesite and rhyolite. The word dacite comes from Dacia, a province of the Roman Empire which lay between the Danube River and Carpathian Mountains (now modern Romania and Moldova) where the rock was first described.

The Battle of Stamford Bridge took place at the village of Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire, in England on 25 September 1066, between an English army under King Harold Godwinson and an invading Norwegian force led by King Harald Hardrada and the English king's brother Tostig Godwinson. After a bloody battle, both Hardrada and Tostig along with most of the Norwegians were killed. Although Harold Godwinson repelled the Norwegian invaders, his army was defeated by the Normans at Hastings less than three weeks later. The battle has traditionally been presented as symbolising the end of the Viking Age, although major Scandinavian campaigns in Britain and Ireland occurred in the following decades, such as those of King Sweyn Estrithson of Denmark in 1069-1070 and King Magnus Barefoot of Norway in 1098 and 1102-1103.

The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung.  Question: \\"What is happening when your chest decreases in size while breathing?\\" Response: \\"Exhaling, or breathing out\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question.

There were no such buses packed with paid protesters.      But that didn't matter.      While some fake news is produced purposefully by teenagers in the Balkans or entrepreneurs in the United States seeking to make money from advertising, false information can also arise from misinformed social media posts by regular people that are seized on and spread through a hyperpartisan blogosphere.      Here, The New York Times deconstructs how Mr. Tucker’s now-deleted declaration on Twitter the night after the election turned into a fake-news phenomenon.

Q:Given the below context:  Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

A battle-hardened Huntley-Brinkley reporter later said that no military action he had witnessed had ever frightened or disturbed him as much as what he saw in Birmingham. Two out-of-town photographers in Birmingham that day were Charles Moore, who had previously worked with the Montgomery Advertiser and was now working for Life magazine, and Bill Hudson, with the Associated Press.  Moore was a Marine combat photographer who was \\"jarred\\" and \\"sickened\\" by the use of children and what the Birmingham police and fire departments did to them.  Moore was hit in the ankle by a brick meant for the police. He took several photos that were printed in Life.  The first photo Moore shot that day showed three teenagers being hit by a water jet from a high-pressure firehose. It was titled \\"They Fight a Fire That Won't Go Out\\".  A shorter version of the caption was later used as the title for Fred Shuttlesworth's biography.

D'Artagnan is pursued by Gérard and his brothers, who accuse him of blemishing their sister's honor. Gérard had saw his sister kissing D'Artagnan goodbye or as D'Artagnan put it \\"she wanted to give me something to remember her by!\\". At Musketeer headquarters, Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the cardinal's guards have disbanded the musketeers as per the orders of Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry), the King's minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with England. Rochefort confides to the Cardinal that there are three musketeers that have refused to relinquish their duties: Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charlie Sheen).Upon reaching Paris, the headstrong D'Artagnan has a series of chance physical encounters with these same three musketeers, resulting in D'Artagnan accepting a sword duel with each one that very day. D'Artagnan arrives at the Ruins for his first duel and, much to his surprise, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reveal themselves as musketeers. But before the duels can commence, the captain of the cardinal's guard appears with orders to arrest the resistant musketeers. Although D'Artagnan himself is not under arrest, he joins the three musketeers in the ensuing skirmish, implicating himself with them.

Given the question: What is the last name of the person who was offered a song on the condition that he release it as his next single?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Ventura was born James George Janos on July 15, 1951 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of George William Janos and his wife, Bernice Martha (nee Lenz). Both of his parents were World War II veterans. Ventura has an older brother who served in the Vietnam War. Ventura has described himself as Slovak, since his father's parents were from what is now Slovakia; his mother was of German descent. After the legislature refused to increase spending for security, Ventura attracted criticism when he decided not to live in the governor's mansion during his tenure, choosing instead to shut it down and stay at his home in Maple Grove. Critics pointed to the loss of jobs for several working-class people at the mansion and the extra cost of reopening the mansion later.  In 1999, a group of disgruntled citizens petitioned to recall Governor Ventura, alleging, among other things, that \\"the use of state security personnel to protect the governor on a book promotion tour constituted illegal use of state property for personal gain.\\" The petition was denied. The proposed petition was dismissed by order of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Minnesota. Under Minnesota law, a proposed petition for recall is required to be reviewed by the Chief Justice for legal sufficiency, and, upon such review, the Chief Justice determined that it did not allege the commission of any act that violated Minnesota law. Ventura sought attorney's fees as a sanction for the filing of a frivolous petition for recall, but that request was denied, on the ground that there was no statutory authority for such an award.  In November 2011, Ventura held a press conference in relation to a lawsuit he had filed against the Transportation Security Administration. During that press conference, Ventura stated that he would \\"never stand for a national anthem again, I will turn my back and raise a fist the same way Tommy Smith and John Carlos did in the '68 Olympics, Jesse Ventura will do that today.\\"  During his tenure as governor, Ventura drew frequent fire from the press in the Twin Cities. He referred to reporters as \\"media jackals,\\" a term that even appeared on the press passes required to enter the governor's press area. Shortly after Ventura's election as governor, author and humorist Garrison Keillor wrote a satirical book about the event, spoofing Ventura as \\"Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente,\\" a self-aggrandizing former \\"Navy W.A.L.R.U.S. (Water Air Land Rising Up Suddenly)\\" turned professional wrestler turned politician. Initially, Ventura responded angrily to the satire, but later, in a conciliatory vein, said that Keillor \\"makes Minnesota proud\\". During his term, Ventura appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, in which he responded controversially to the following question: \\"So which is the better city of the Twin Cities, Minneapolis or St. Paul?\\". Ventura responded, \\"Minneapolis. Those streets in St. Paul must have been designed by drunken Irishmen\\". He later apologized for the remark, adding that it was not intended to be taken seriously.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Were there other things he was also criticized for?","output":"Yes, aside from not living in the governor's mansion and the state security issue, Ventura was criticized for his interactions with the press, calling reporters \\"media jackals,\\" and making controversial remarks about St. Paul's streets being designed by \\"drunken Irishmen.\\" Additionally, he faced criticism for his response to Garrison Keillor's satirical book about his election as governor."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is some data: Ayam penyet, country, Java. Generate a detailed description of this data. Sentence:","output":"Ayam penyet is a delicious and traditional Indonesian dish that originates from the beautiful country of Indonesia, specifically from the culturally-rich island of Java. The name of the dish translates to \\"smashed chicken,\\" which refers to the unique preparation method that involves the use of a mortar and pestle or a heavy object to tenderize the chicken before it is fried to achieve a succulent and juicy taste. The dish is well-known for its distinctive blend of rich flavors and tantalizing aromas, which results from a combination of a wide variety of handpicked spices, such as turmeric, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, galangal, and candlenuts. These spices are finely ground into a fragrant paste, which serves as a marinade for the chicken before being cooked. Once the chicken has been thoroughly marinated, it is deep-fried in hot oil until it turns a beautiful golden-brown color, with a crispy skin and tender meat. In addition to the flavorful chicken, Ayam penyet is typically served with a mouthwatering accompaniment known as sambal, a special type of chili paste made from a mixture of ground red chilies, garlic, tomatoes, and shallots, seasoned with salt, sugar, and sometimes shrimp paste. This fiery condiment adds an extra layer of heat and complexity to the dish, making it burst with flavor. The dish is usually enjoyed with steamed white rice, which allows for the delicious spices and chicken flavors to truly shine. Additionally, Ayam penyet may be accompanied by various side dishes, such as fresh vegetables, including cucumbers, lettuce, and tomatoes, and crunchy fried tofu or tempeh. These side dishes not only add color and balance to the meal but also serve to temper the spiciness of the sambal for those who may be less accustomed to the heat. Ayam penyet is not only a popular dish in Indonesia but has also gained significant recognition and appreciation in neighboring countries like Malaysia and Singapore. The dish can be found in many Indonesian and Southeast Asian restaurants worldwide, reflecting its widespread appeal and influence on global culinary landscapes. In summary, Ayam penyet is an exquisite Indonesian dish hailing from the island of Java, which marries the succulent flavors of marinated and smashed fried chicken with the spicy kick of sambal, making it a quintessential representation of the diverse and rich culinary heritage of the country. The dish's bold flavors and satisfying texture have earned it recognition and popularity beyond Indonesia's borders, making it a beloved staple in Southeast Asian cuisine."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A rare parasitic worm that can infect people's brains is causing concern in Maui, where there has been a rise in cases in recent months.      So far this year, two residents in Maui and two visitors to the island have become infected with the parasite, and four additional cases are under investigation, according to local media outlet Hawaii News Now. Prior to this year, there were just two infections on the island in the past 10 years.      The parasite, called rat lungworm or Angiostrongylus cantonensis, can infect the brain and cause meningitis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infected people may experience headaches, neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting and abnormal sensations in their arms and legs. Most people fully recover without treatment, but in rare cases the infection can cause neurological problems or death, the CDC said. [10 Bizarre Diseases You Can Get Outdoors]      “If you could imagine, it’s like having a slow-moving bullet go through your brain,\\" Dr. Sarah Park, an epidemiologist at the Hawaii State Department of Health, told the Associated Press. \\"There’s no rhyme or reason why it’s going to hang out in this part of the brain or that part of the brain,\\" Park said.      The parasite is found in rats, but larvae from the parasite can also infect snails and slugs, the CDC said. People can become infected if they eat raw or undercooked snails or slugs, or by eating contaminated produce, the CDC said.      The parasite is prevalent in Southeast Asia and tropical Pacific islands, but in recent years, its geographical distribution has expanded to other areas, including Africa, the Caribbean and the United States, the CDC said.      In the past decade, more than 70 cases of rat lungworm were reported in Hawaii, most on the Big Island, according to the Hawaii State Legislature.      Original article on Live Science. ||||| State health officials are investigating four possible new cases of rat lungworm disease on Maui.      In the past decade, there had been only two cases of the parasitic infection on the Valley Isle. Data show there were 60 cases in the last 10 years, with the vast majority of them on the Big Island.      Already this year, there have been two other cases of Maui residents contracting the disease, including one who may have been infected during a work trip to the Big Island. The state Health Department said two other visitors to Maui also got the infection and returned to their home states.      The increase in cases led to a standing room only crowd at a public information meeting Thursday night in Hana.      There is no cure for the disease, which usually affects rats -- thus the name -- and then is passed along to slugs and snails like those found in the garden.      \\"Even though it's just a few cases, it's still the fact that we received a few cases where we normally might see one in a blue moon on Maui. That makes us concerned that something has changed potentially on Maui to bring their risk of seeing the disease similar, closer to what we see on the Big Island, and trying to identify what that risk is an ongoing effort,\\" said State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Park.      Park also said the infection is preventable. People are being told to was fruits and vegetables thoroughly to get rid of any slug or snail larvae that could be infected with the parasite.

Interested in Hawaii? Add Hawaii as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Hawaii news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest      A worm called Angiostrongylus cantonensis causes the infection; there is no treatment, and in rare cases, it can be fatal. People who catch the infection by eating raw or undercooked snails, or contaminated fruits and vegetables, can develop meningitis.      Earlier this week, health officials in Maui reported that six cases of the parasitic infection have been reported in the last three months compared to the previous decade when only two cases were found, according to the Associated Press and ABC News affiliate KITV.      Dr. Lorrin Pang, the Maui district health officer, explained to worried residents why the disease is so damaging. In a live-streamed presentation on Facebook, Pang said that the parasite can live in the body for months. As a result, inflammation from the body's immune response can result in scarring or other damage to the nervous system, which can cause pain during the infection.      \\"Our body realizes this is so foreign we attack it...by that time the worm is one inch big and by then it's a major battle,\\" Pang said, describing the immune system fight to kill the parasite. \\"There is a whole lot of collateral damage...attacking the worm attacks ourselves and that is the issue.\\"      A bad headache, neck stiffness, light sensitivity and vomiting and can start more than six weeks after ingesting the worm, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.      p://abcnews.go.com/Health/hundreds-scientists-offer-lab-space-people-affected-trump/story?id=45218998] text=[Hundreds of Scientists Offer Lab Space for People Affected by Trump Travel Ban]/>      Dr. Constantine Tsigrelis, an infectious disease specialist with University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, said that treatment is complicated because doctors don't want to exacerbate an immune response that kills the parasite but then injures the brain or nervous system in the process.      \\"An anti-parasitic drug could kill the worm but the problem is that the dying organisms can create a very severe inflammatory response and the patient can get worse,\\" Tsigrelis told ABC News.      The worm can’t live very long inside humans, usually only a few months according to Pang. However, it can cause permanent damage as it invades the brain's membrane. The worm has been found in Louisiana, Hawaii and the Caribbean, but lives primarily in the Pacific Basin and Southeast Asia, according to the CDC.      The parasite lives in the blood vessels of rats' lungs – giving the parasite its name – but the larvae can be expelled in rat droppings and eaten by snails, slugs and other animals, who can pass these baby parasitic worms on to humans.      Tsigrelis said potential visitors should not be deterred from a Hawaiian getaway. But they should take steps to protect themselves.      “If you’re going to Hawaii, enjoy the local food but take those precautions regarding washing fresh produce, making sure salads have been washed and avoiding undercooked slugs, snails, crabs,” Tsigrelis said.      Washing hands and utensils after eating or preparing raw slugs, snails, or freshwater shrimp can prevent infection, as can thoroughly cleaning raw vegetables, according to the Hawaiian Department of Health. Boiling food for three to five minutes, or freezing it at 5 degrees Fahrenheit for 24 hours or more, kills the larvae. Clearing snails, slugs and rats from gardens and other outdoor spaces can also prevent the spread of the worm.

Three of the cases have been confirmed, while a seventh case involves a Maui woman who believes she contracted the parasite on the Big Island, Maui District Health Officer Dr. Lorrin Pang said Tuesday.      Rat lungworm disease is a condition in which parasitic worm larvae infect people’s brains. It is carried by rats and transmitted by snails and slugs.      advertisement      Officials say residents can reduce the risk of contracting the potentially life-threatening disease by thoroughly washing fruits and vegetables before consumption.      Experts are still determining the best way to get rid of the invasive slugs, Pang said. Smashing, burying or burning them does not deter rats from eating them and restarting the cycle of rat lungworm.      “The slug is easy to kill, but the parasite; it’s not so easy,” he said.      State epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Park said there is an average of about 10 rat lungworm cases each year statewide and that the recent spike is concerning. A vast majority of Hawaii’s cases are reported on the Big Island.      The infection can cause a rare type of meningitis that triggers severe headaches and stiffness of the neck, tingling or painful feelings in the skin or extremities, fever, nausea and vomiting, according to the state Department of Health Disease Investigation Branch. Temporary paralysis of the face and light sensitivity may also occur.      “If you could imagine, it’s like having a slow-moving bullet go through your brain and there’s no rhyme or reason why it’s going to hang out in this part of the brain or that part of the brain,” Park said. |||||Summary:","output":"A rare parasitic worm called rat lungworm, or Angiostrongylus cantonensis, that can infect people's brains has caused concern in Maui, where there has been a significant rise in cases in recent months.

Translate to Finnish: If we look at the press we can see that 90% - or even more - of the material being printed focuses on falling infection rates, but very little is said of cures or how citizens should act.

Finnish: Jos tarkastelemme lehdistöä, voimme havaita, että suurin osa, jopa yli 90 %, siinä esitetyistä tiedoista ja uutisista keskittyy laskeneiden infektioiden määriin, kun taas parannuskeinoista sekä toimenpiteistä, joita kansalaiset voisivat ja tulisi tehdä, puhutaan todella vähän. Vaikuttaa siltä, että lehdistön pääasiallinen huomio kohdistuu epidemian kielteisiin vaikutuksiin, eikä niinkään mahdollisiin toimiin ja ratkaisuihin, joita voisimme soveltaa sairastumisen vähentämiseksi tai ehkäisemiseksi. Tämän vuoksi on erittäin tärkeää, että kansalaisille tarjotaan luotettavaa ja ajantasaista tietoa strategioista, joita voidaan käyttää koronaviruksen torjumiseksi, sekä toimenpiteistä, joita he voivat itse tehdä osana yhteisiä pyrkimyksiä estää viruksen leviämistä. Kansalaisten tulisi saada tietoa rokotusten edistymisestä, mahdollisista lääkkeistä, karanteenikäytännöistä, sosiaalisen etäisyyden ylläpitämisestä, sekä testeistä ja niiden saatavuudesta. Tarvitsemme myös selkeät ohjeet siitä, miten voimme arvioida oman terveydentilamme ja milloin meidän tulisi hakea lääkärin apua. Samalla on tärkeää, että lehdistö ei liioittele asioiden kääntöpuolta, esimerkiksi sen osalta kuinka monta ihmistä on toipunut viruksesta ja kehittänyt vasta-aineita tai saanut rokotteen. Tämä olisi erittäin hyödyllistä kansalaisten motivaation ylläpitämiseksi, jotta he uskoisivat, että toimilla on todellisia vaikutuksia ja voimme yhdessä voittaa tämän haasteen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose work there was destroyed in the Blitz?  Burges played an important role in the renaissance of High Victorian stained glass. The provision of glass of appropriate colour and richness was central to many of his decorative themes, and he invested effort in working with the best cartoonists and manufacturers to achieve this. He also studied the history of glass production, writing in his second Art Applied to Industry lecture, \\"[a] use of antiquarian studies is to restore disused arts, and to get all the good we can out of them for our own improvement.\\" In the catalogue to the exhibition of stained glass cartoons from Cardiff Castle, Sargent pays tribute to \\"his deep knowledge of the history and techniques of glass manufacture\\" and Lawrence considers him a pioneer who, by his \\"painstaking studies, re-established the principles of medieval decoration and used this to make [his] own bold and original statements.\\" The results were outstanding; Lawrence wrote that Burges designed with \\"a vibrancy, an intensity and a brilliance which no other glass maker could match.\\" He acknowledges Burges's debt to the manufacturers and craftsmen with whom he worked, in particular, Gualbert Saunders, whose \\"technique [gave] Burges's glass its most distinctive characteristic, namely the flesh colour. This is unique, had no precedents and has had no imitators.\\" As well as at Saint Fin Barre's, Burges designed stained glass for all of his own significant churches, for reconstructions of medieval churches undertaken by others, and for his secular buildings.

Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - Clergy are some of the main and important formal leaders within certain religions. The roles and functions of clergy vary in different religious traditions but these usually involve presiding over specific rituals and teaching their religion's doctrines and practices. Some of the terms used for individual clergy are \\"cleric\\", \\"clergyman\\", \\"clergywoman\\", \\"clergyperson\\" and \\"churchman\\".  - In Christian ecclesiology, full communion is a relationship between church organizations, groups, and individuals that mutually recognize their sharing the essential doctrines of Christianity and \\"are able to recognize in one another the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church in its fullness\\". Thus a profession of faith is required of people wishing to enter into full communion with the Catholic Church, even if they have been members of a separate church whose sacraments the Catholic Church considers to be valid. Being \\"in full communion with the Catholic Church\\" is incompatible with denying what it has definitively proposed as its teaching on faith and morals.  - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - Paul Coussa ( 9 September 1917 -- 7 July 2012 ) was a Syrian born Iraqi prelate of the Armenian Catholic Church .

Review: jordan jealous  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"The movie review sentence \\"Jordan jealous\\" appears to be more negative in sentiment. However, it is important to note that the sentence is very minimal and does not provide sufficient information to fully comprehend the intended sentiment. It would be beneficial to have additional context or more elaborative description to determine with certainty whether the writer is trying to express a positive or negative opinion about the movie. In most cases, the term \\"jealous\\" typically carries a negative connotation, suggesting feelings of envy or resentment. In the context of the given sentence, it seems possible that the character named Jordan may be experiencing envy or has acted negatively in the movie. On the other hand, without proper context, it is difficult to narrow down if \\"Jordan jealous\\" holds a negative connotation for the overall movie experience or just describes a specific event within the film. In this particular case, it is crucial to consider the other aspects of the review, such as plot, cinematography, or acting, in order to ascertain whether the critic's overall impression is positive or negative. To summarize, the movie review sentence \\"Jordan jealous\\" leans towards a negative sentiment, primarily due to the use of the word \\"jealous.\\" However, it is difficult to definitively categorize the sentence as negative without more context and additional information about the movie or the critic's opinions on various elements of the film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Steven Frederic Seagal was born in Lansing, Michigan on April 10, 1952, the son of medical technician Patricia (1930-2003) and high school math teacher Samuel Seagal (1928-1991). His mother was of Dutch, English, and German ancestry, while his paternal grandparents were Russian Jews who immigrated to the U.S. He also has Irish and Mongolian heritage. When Seagal was five years old, his parents relocated to Fullerton, California. Seagal moved to Japan at some point between 1971 and 1973. The date of his journey has become a point of contention due to Seagal's statement that he studied with Morihei Uyeshiba, the founder of aikido, who died in 1969. Terry Dobson, a fifth-degree black belt who studied with the master from 1961 to 1969, dismissed this claim, saying, \\"That story is bull. [Back then] I never heard of Steven Seagal.\\" By 1974 Seagal had returned California. That year he met Miyako Fujitani, a second-degree black belt and daughter of an Osaka aikido master who had come to Los Angeles to teach aikido. When Miyako returned to Osaka, Seagal went with her. The following year they married and had a son, Kentaro, and a daughter, Ayako. He taught at the school owned by Miyako's family (though he is often stated to have been the first non-Asian to open a dojo in Japan). As of 1990, Miyako and her brother still taught there, and her mother was the chairwoman.  Seagal initially returned to Taos, New Mexico, with his student (and later film stuntman) Craig Dunn, where they opened a dojo, although Seagal spent much of his time pursuing other ventures. After another period in Japan, Seagal returned to the U.S. in 1983 with senior student Haruo Matsuoka. They opened an aikido dojo, initially in North Hollywood, California, but later moved it to the city of West Hollywood. Seagal left Matsuoka in charge of the dojo, which he ran until the two parted ways in 1997.  Seagal helped train Brazilian Mixed Martial Artist Lyoto Machida, who credited Seagal for helping him perfect the front kick that he used to knock out Randy Couture at UFC 129 in May 2011. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: How long did they have the dojo","output":"Seagal and Matsuoka opened their aikido dojo in 1983, and they ran it together until 1997.

Saint Patrick's feast day, as a kind of national day, was already being celebrated by the Irish in Europe in the ninth and tenth centuries. In later times, he became more and more widely seen as the patron of Ireland. Saint Patrick's feast day was finally placed on the universal liturgical calendar in the Catholic Church due to the influence of Waterford-born Franciscan scholar Luke Wadding in the early 1600s. Saint Patrick's Day thus became a holy day of obligation for Roman Catholics in Ireland. It is also a feast day in the Church of Ireland, which is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion. The church calendar avoids the observance of saints' feasts during certain solemnities, moving the saint's day to a time outside those periods. St Patrick's Day is occasionally affected by this requirement, when 17 March falls during Holy Week. This happened in 1940, when Saint Patrick's Day was observed on 3 April to avoid it coinciding with Palm Sunday, and again in 2008, where it was officially observed on 15 March. St Patrick's Day will not fall within Holy Week again until 2160. However, the popular festivities may still be held on 17 March or on a weekend near to the feast day. Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: is st. patrick's day a holy day? Options: [-] no. [-] yes.","output":"[-] yes. The passage tells us that Saint Patrick's Day became a holy day of obligation for Roman Catholics in Ireland. This means that it is a special day when Catholics have to participate in specific religious activities.

Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"Less effect. If there is less governmental protection in place for animals that undergo hibernation, it can negatively impact their ability to hibernate properly. The reason for this is that governmental protections often play a crucial role in preserving the habitats and ecosystems of these animals, helping to maintain the balance and stability of their environments. When these protections are reduced, there could be an increased risk of habitat destruction, pollution, and other human-related disturbances that threaten the well-being of the animals and their ecosystems. The second effect mentioned in the process is the animals gaining weight during good weather. This weight gain is important because it provides the animals with the energy stores they need to survive throughout their hibernation period. With less governmental protection, the animals' food sources may become threatened due to increased human activity or resource extraction, which could lead to a disruption in the availability and quality of their food sources. However, the impact of these changes on the animals' ability to gain weight during good weather may be less pronounced. This is because many animals have evolved to be highly adaptable to fluctuations in their environment, including variations in food availability. Additionally, these animals may be able to compensate for any disruptions in their food intake by adjusting their foraging behaviors or dietary preferences. While less governmental protection is likely to have a negative impact on the overall ability of animals to hibernate properly, the direct effect on their weight gain during good weather may be less pronounced. It is essential, however, to recognize that continued reductions in governmental protection could lead to worsening conditions for these animals and their habitats, potentially jeopardizing their ability to hibernate effectively in the long term. Therefore, it is crucial to advocate for adequate protection and conservation efforts to preserve these vital processes for the well-being and survival of hibernating animals."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The Korean education system, like many in Asia, is intensely competitive, with students even competing to get into the best cramming schools, to help them get ahead.

I'll definitely look into brightening up the place.\\" Feeling more confident, Tony decided to push his luck. \\"And finally - this isn't a major issue, but it's something to consider – the break room could use a more inviting atmosphere. Perhaps upgrading the coffee machine and providing a few more comfortable seating options would make it a better place for relaxation and rejuvenation during breaks.\\" Bill chuckled, recognizing the wisdom in Tony's words. \\"You're absolutely right. I'll be sure to get on that, too.\\" Satisfied with the outcome of the conversation, Tony leaned back in his chair once more. \\"Well, that's about it from me. And remember, I'm always here to lend a helping hand if you need it.\\" Bill smiled gratefully. \\"Thanks, Tony. I appreciate your input.

Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was his final major compositional project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since... The answer to this question is:","output":"Sibelius."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

As you slid your finger down the columns of groceries and toiletries, you would invariably be stopped by something along the lines of \\"2dozjumHerbal Essences\\" or \\"1pepperoni TC,\\" with the \\"TC\\" underlined twice and flanked by gnarled masses of pencil scratch-outs. When we were kids, we dreaded accompanying her to Wal-Mart, or worse, the Cosco at the edge of town, where the echoing rafters and limitless aisles seemed to mock the confusion into which we were inevitably thrown when handed torn-off fragments of the list. Of course, it was easy enough to see in hindsight that \\"2dozjumHerbal Essences\\" was merely the bastard child of two drunkenly weaving columns--we had been supposed to get two dozen jumbo eggs and a bottle of my mother's favourite brand of shampoo (ever inventive in creating proprietary abbreviations--\\"TC\\" standing for, what else, thin crust pizza--my mother scrupulously wrote out brand names in full). It was a little like ordering chemicals for a laboratory, sans any knowledge of chemistry--or, for that matter, laboratories, although my ignorance of the distinction between baking soda and baking powder cannot be entirely the root of my confusion. Eventually I--and my siblings--learned the difference between tomato paste and tomato sauce, and could readily distinguish one brand of laundry detergent from a similarly-styled knock-off, but my shame-faced trips back to the mothercart never ceased. I would track her down, most often in the produce section--she was usually loath to trust us with the delicate task of selecting the very best fruits and vegetables--and hand her back my portion of the list, asking for an explanation.

Bad Handwriting: The mother's handwriting is difficult to decipher, which adds to the confusion in understanding the items on the list. 2. Weird Abbreviations: The mother uses her own abbreviations, like \\"TC\\" for thin crust pizza, which are not commonly known to the author and their siblings. This makes it challenging for them to comprehend what each abbreviation stands for. 3. Incomplete Information: The mother's list often lacks clear and complete information about the items to be purchased, such as the specific brand of a product or the exact variant of an item. This forces the author and their siblings to guess what their mother wants, leading to errors and confusion. These factors collectively contribute to the author's experience of feeling overwhelmed and confused when tasked with shopping based on their mother's shopping list.

Benefits Street star White Dee is currently living it up on Majorca, but had her sunny spell darkened by an alleged assault earlier this week. However, if these images are anything to go by, she would have given as good as she got, had she had the chance. White Dee, real name Deirdre Kelly, was seen throwing an entire bucket of ice over a fellow holiday maker as she enjoys the perks of her new fame in Magaluf. Ice, ice baby: White Dee attacks a fellow fun-timer with an entire bucket of ice while attending a pool party in Magaluf, Majorca. Ms Kelly, 42, was seen talking to the younger man by a cask used as a table, stacked with plastic cups full of colourful drinks. Lifting up the bucket of ice towards her companion, she decided to give him a cooling off, and threw the contents over his shoulder. Fortunately for Ms Kelly, the 'victim' seemed to take it all in his stride, laughing as she walked off, cigarette sticking out of her mouth. It is believed these photographs were taken before she was attacked by a man at the hotel, where she was hosting a Carnage Pool Party. White Dee was allegedly 'kicked in the back of the head and hurled into a swimming pool' by a British man working on the island. Add some ice? White Dee innocently picks up the bucket, possibly to offer her companion some more ice with his drink.

Ms Kelly struggled to swim as the man's friends filmed the incident, pointing and laughing.

No cold shoulder: Fortunately for White Dee, her younger companion seemed to find the ice bucket prank funny. Hold on tight! White Dee shrieks with delight as she gets taken for a spin on the back of a quad bike. Playful: The sisters get into a water fight as they cool off from the intense Spanish sun.

The NBA announced the suspension on Wednesday. Anthony served the suspension Thursday, when the Knicks lost 81-76 to the Indiana Pacers.      \\"There are no circumstances in which it is acceptable for a player to confront an opponent after a game,\\" NBA executive vice president basketball operations Stu Jackson said in a statement. \\"Carmelo Anthony attempted to engage with Kevin Garnett multiple times after Monday's game and therefore a suspension was warranted.\\"      Anthony said before the suspension was announced that he did not believe he deserved to be disciplined.      \\"If you just go off the actual facts of what happened, I don't think anything will happen,\\" Anthony said.      After he and Garnett were called for technical fouls for jawing at one another in the closing minutes of Monday's game, Anthony approached Garnett at the Celtics' team bus. Madison Square Garden security, New York City Police officers, team security and even Knicks coach Mike Woodson intervened before the incident could escalate.

It's the rough equivalent of a 1 fine for someone earning 40,000 per year.      Cuban is also no stranger to the NBA dinging him for cash since he bought the Mavericks in 2000. According to the Dallas Morning News, he's been docked a total of some 2 million in the 13 years since.      Cuban is exceptionally outspoken and candid on Twitter for a billionaire sports team owner, so it's not entirely surprising that his tweeting thumbs — rather than his sharp tongue — did him in this time.      But for all that trash talk, there's one team's fan base he says he won't mess with online — the Los Angeles Lakers.      “There is more Twitter courage in Southern California than probably any other part of the world,\\" Cuban said in November. “I could say ‘Kobe tied his shoe laces wrong’ and I’d probably get death threats on Twitter.”      What do you think about the NBA fining Mark Cuban for his tweet — Right?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.  Now, I have a new situation: All marine creatures are not fish. There are some mammals, for example, whales, also live in the water. Rob wants to know more about differences between fish and other non fish creatures in the water. He divided them into two groups, group A and group B. Group A consists of fish, and group B consists of non fish creatures in the water. He started to see the differences between these two groups.  Answer this question please: In group B, would the eggs most likely develop outside or inside the mother's body? Answer:","output":"In group B, which consists of non-fish marine creatures, the eggs would most likely develop inside the mother's body. This is because many non-fish marine animals, such as marine mammals (e.g., whales, dolphins, and seals) and reptiles (e.g., sea turtles), give birth to live young. These animals undergo internal fertilization, and their embryos develop within the mother's body until they are ready to be born. However, it is also important to note that there are exceptions within group B, as some non-fish marine animals, like cephalopods (e.g., squid and octopus) and crustaceans (e.g., crabs and lobsters), do lay eggs that develop outside the mother's body. Still, compared to fish species, group B is more likely to have a higher percentage of marine animals with internal development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Long ago, a young Plains warrior is tested by being the target of three different weapons.  Centuries later, Ernest P. Worrell works as a maintenance man at Kamp Kikakee but hopes to become a counselor. He quickly becomes a valuable addition to the staff, skilled at Plains Indian Sign Language, used by Kikakee's owner, Chief St. Cloud.  A small group of juvenile delinquents, the Second Chancers, come to Kikakee. Head Counselor Tipton assigns Kikakee's most experienced counselor, Ross Stennis, to be the boys' counselor. Stennis is unhappy with this assignment, and he treats the boys harshly. After he goes too far by intentionally causing Moustafa Jones, the smallest boy in the group, to nearly drown in the lake during swimming, only for Moustafa to be rescued by Ernest, the boys retaliate against Stennis's cruelty by toppling his lifeguard perch into the lake, badly injuring Stennis's leg in the process. Since Stennis is no longer able to perform his duties as a counselor and Kikakee is already shorthanded, Tipton offers Stennis's position to Ernest. The Second Chancers initially give Ernest trouble, but they start to show respect during a campfire session when Nurse St. Cloud translates her grandfather's description of the warrior initiation ritual for his tribe. The initiate must hold still while a knife, a stone hatchet, and an arrow are thrown or shot at him.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Ex-Penn St. assistant Sandusky convicted of abuse BELLEFONTE, Pa. – For years, the children Jerry Sandusky had preyed upon kept quiet about what the former Penn State assistant football coach did to them in echoing shower stalls, empty hotel rooms and the muffled confines of his basement bedroom. Late Friday, after a swift trial and less than two days of deliberations, a jury issued an emphatic verdict: Sandusky was guilty on 45 counts of sexual abuse, meaning the man once considered a successor to coach Joe Paterno will likely die in prison. The verdict is not the end of the scandal that took down beloved football coach Joe Paterno and deeply shook the state's most prominent university. It will play out for years in courtrooms and through a set of ongoing investigations. But the trial did present one piece of finality: Sandusky was taken away in handcuffs to the county jail. Sentencing will be in about three months, but mandatory minimums will keep him behind bars for life. \\"One of the recurring themes in this case was, 'Who would believe a kid?'\\" said Attorney General Linda Kelly. \\"The answer is, we in Bellefonte, Pa., would believe a kid.\\" Sandusky, a retired defensive coach who was once Paterno's heir apparent, showed little emotion as the verdict was read, giving his wife, Dottie, and family members a half-wave as the county sheriff led him away. There were only three acquittals among the charges related to 10 victims, eight of whom took the stand to describe fondling, forced oral sex and anal rape. Many of the accusers testified that they had told no one of the abuse that dated as far back as the mid-1990s — not parents, not girlfriends and not police. The accuser known in court papers as Victim 6, whose mother alerted authorities in 1998 after Sandusky took her son into a shower, broke down in tears upon hearing the verdicts in the courtroom. Afterward, a prosecutor embraced him and said, \\"Did I ever lie to you?\\" The man, now 25, testified that Sandusky called himself the \\"tickle monster\\" in a shower assault. He declined to comment to a reporter afterward. His mother said: \\"Nobody wins. We've all lost.\\" One of the three counts for which Sandusky was acquitted concerned Victim 6, an indecent assault charge. The man testified that Sandusky had given him a bear hug in the shower but at one point he just \\"blacked out.\\" The other acquittals were an indecent assault charge related to Victim 5, who said Sandusky fondled him in the shower, and an involuntary deviate sexual intercourse charge regarding Victim 2, the boy graduate assistant Mike McQueary saw being attacked in a campus shower. Almost immediately after the judge adjourned, loud cheers could be heard from a couple hundred people gathered outside the courthouse as word quickly spread that Sandusky had been convicted. The crowd included victim advocates and local residents with their kids. Many held up their smartphones to take pictures as people filtered out of the building. As Sandusky was placed in the cruiser to be taken to jail, someone yelled at him to \\"Rot in hell!\\" Others hurled insults and he shook his head no in response. Defense attorney Joe Amendola was interrupted by cheers from the crowd on the courthouse steps when he said, \\"The sentence that Jerry will receive will be a life sentence.\\" In addition to the eight who testified, there were two yet-unidentified victims for which prosecutors relied on testimony from a university janitor and McQueary, whose account of a sexual encounter between Sandusky and a boy of about 10 years old ultimately led to the Paterno's dismissal and the university president's ouster. Sandusky did not take the stand in his own defense. After the verdict was announced, defense attorney Karl Rominger said it was \\"a tough case\\" with a lot of charges and that an appeal was certain. He said the defense team \\"didn't exactly have a lot of time to prepare.\\" The ex-coach had repeatedly denied the allegations, and his defense suggested that his accusers had a financial motive to make up stories, years after the fact. His attorneys also painted Sandusky as the victim of overzealous police investigators who coached the alleged victims into giving accusatory statements. One accuser testified that Sandusky molested him in the locker-room showers and in hotels while trying to ensure his silence with gifts and trips to bowl games. He also said Sandusky had sent him \\"creepy love letters.\\" Another spoke of forced oral sex and instances of rape in the basement of Sandusky's home, including abuse that left him bleeding. He said he once tried to scream for help, knowing that Sandusky's wife was upstairs, but figured the basement must be soundproof. Another, a foster child, said Sandusky warned that he would never see his family again if he ever told anyone what happened. And just hours after the case went to jurors, lawyers for one of Sandusky's six children, Matt, said he had told authorities that his father abused him. Matt Sandusky had been prepared to testify on behalf of prosecutors, his lawyers said in a statement. The lawyers said they arranged for Matt Sandusky to meet with law enforcement officials but did not explain why he didn't testify. \\"This has been an extremely painful experience for Matt and he has asked us to convey his request that the media respect his privacy,\\" the statement said. It didn't go into details about his allegations. Defense witnesses, including Dottie Sandusky, described Sandusky's philanthropic work with children over the years, and many spoke in positive terms about his reputation in the community. Prosecutors had portrayed those efforts as an effective means by which Sandusky could camouflage his molestation as he targeted boys who were the same age as participants in The Second Mile, a charity he founded in the 1970s for at-risk youth. Sandusky's arrest in November led the Penn State trustees to fire Paterno as head coach, saying he exhibited a lack of leadership after fielding a report from McQueary. The scandal also led to the ouster of university President Graham Spanier and criminal charges against two university administrators for failing to properly report suspected child abuse and perjury. The two administrators, athletic director Tim Curley and now-retired vice president Gary Schultz, are fighting the allegations and await trial. The family of Paterno, who died exactly five months before Sandusky's conviction, released a statement saying: \\"Although we understand the task of healing is just beginning, today's verdict is an important milestone. The community owes a measure of gratitude to the jurors for their diligent service. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the victims and their families.\\" In a statement, Penn State praised the accusers who testified and said that it planned to invite the victims of Sandusky's abuse to participate in a private program to address their concerns and compensate them for claims related to the school. Sandusky had initially faced 52 counts of sex abuse. Prosecutors dropped one count and the judge tossed three others during the trial, on grounds two were unproven, one was brought under a statute that didn't apply and another was duplicative.

By Sara Smyth PUBLISHED: 16:25 EST, 8 August 2013 | UPDATED: 18:03 EST, 8 August 2013 Attacker: Yuri Zarutsky today said he acted alone in the acid attack, which is a contradiction of previous statements The man accused of throwing a jar of sulphuric acid in Sergei Filin's face said he acted alone and top Bolshoi dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko did not pay him to commit the assault. In a reversal of previous statements, Yuri Zarutsky, who was alleged to be the hired 'hitman' who became involved in the attack on Mr Dmitrichenko's behalf, said he initiated the attack independently. He argued he expected Mr Zarutsky to beat Mr","output":"Filin up, instead of using acid. \\"I took the decision [to use acid] on my own, without consulting anyone,\\" Zarutsky said in an interview with the Russian news website Life News. \\"I thought it would be a suitable punishment for everything that Filin had done to others, especially to the dancers in the theatre.\\" This new revelation has left investigators puzzled, as it directly contradicts earlier reports that top Bolshoi dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko had masterminded the assault in an attempt to exact revenge on Sergei Filin, the theatre's artistic director, for alleged professional slights. Zarutsky's confession, if true, would exonerate Dmitrichenko, who was previously implicated as the organizer of the attack. Dmitrichenko was arrested in March, alongside Zarutsky and an alleged getaway driver, for what was initially believed to be a retaliatory move against Filin for not promoting Dmitrichenko's partner within the Bolshoi Theatre. Filin suffered severe burns to his face and was left almost blind after the gruesome attack in January 2013 in Moscow. Despite numerous surgeries and extensive rehabilitation, the artistic director has been left with permanent damage to his eyesight. The acid attack scandal left not only the victim, but also the entire Bolshoi Theatre community, in shock, as it exposed the underlying tensions and rivalries within one of Russia's most prestigious cultural institutions. With Zarutsky now claiming sole responsibility for the attack, the question remains whether he is telling the truth, or if he is attempting to protect Dmitrichenko from potential legal consequences. As the investigation continues, authorities will have to assess the credibility of Zarutsky's statement and determine if his account of events aligns with the evidence gathered. Regardless of the outcome, this twist in the case is likely to have a lasting impact on the reputation and internal dynamics of the Bolshoi Theatre."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Richard was born on 2 October 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle, the twelfth of thirteen children of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and Cecily Neville at the beginning of what has traditionally been labelled the \\"Wars of the Roses\\", a period of \\"three or four decades of political instability and periodic open civil war in the second half of the fifteenth century\\", between supporters of Richard's father (a potential claimant to the throne of King Henry VI from birth)--\\"Yorkists\\"--in opposition to the regime of Henry VI and his wife, Margaret of Anjou, and those loyal to the crown (\\"Lancastrians\\"). When his father and the Nevilles were forced to flee to Ludlow in 1459, Richard and his older brother, George (later Duke of Clarence), were placed in the custody of the Duchess of Buckingham, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. When his father and elder brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were killed at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, Richard, who was eight years old, and George were sent by his mother, the Duchess of York, to the Low Countries. They returned to England following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton and participated in the coronation of Richard's eldest brother as King Edward IV in June 1461. In 1485, following his death in battle against Henry Tudor at Bosworth Field, Richard III's body was buried in Greyfriars Church in Leicester.  Following the discoveries of Richard's remains in 2012, it was decided that they should be reburied at Leicester Cathedral, despite feelings in some quarters that he should have been reburied in York Minster. His remains were carried in procession to the cathedral on 22 March 2015, and reburied on 26 March 2015 at a religious re-burial service at which both the Right Reverend Tim Stevens, the Bishop of Leicester, and the Most Reverend Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, officiated. The British Royal Family was represented by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Countess of Wessex. The actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who is a distant relation of the king and later portrayed him in The Hollow Crown television series, read a poem by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy.  His cathedral tomb was designed by the architects van Heyningen and Haward. The tombstone is deeply incised with a cross, and consists of a rectangular block of white Swaledale fossil stone, quarried in North Yorkshire. It sits on a low plinth made of dark Kilkenny marble, incised with Richard's name, dates and motto (Loyaulte me lie - loyalty binds me). The plinth also carries his coat of arms in pietra dura. The remains of Richard III are in a lead-lined coffin, inside an outer English oak coffin crafted by Michael Ibsen, a direct descendant of Richard's sister Anne of York, and laid in a brick-lined vault below the floor, and below the plinth and tombstone. The original 2010 raised tomb design had been proposed by Langley\`s \\"Looking For Richard Project\\" and fully funded by members of the Richard III Society. The proposal was publicly launched by the Society on 13 February 2013 but rejected by Leicester Cathedral in favour of a memorial slab. However, following a public outcry, the Cathedral changed its position and on 18 July 2013 announced its agreement to give King Richard III a raised tomb monument.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that worked at the Salzburg Festival? ?  Sir Georg Solti,  (born György Stern; 21 October 1912 – 5 September 1997) was a Hungarian-born orchestral and operatic conductor, best known for his appearances with opera companies in Munich, Frankfurt and London, and as a long-serving music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Born in Budapest, he studied there with Béla Bartók, Leó Weiner and Ernő Dohnányi. In the 1930s, he was a répétiteur at the Hungarian State Opera and worked at the Salzburg Festival for Arturo Toscanini. His career was interrupted by the rise of the Nazis' influence on Hungarian politics, and being of Jewish background he fled the increasingly harsh Hungarian anti-Jewish laws in 1938. After conducting a season of Russian ballet in London at the Royal Opera House he found refuge in Switzerland, where he remained during the Second World War. Prohibited from conducting there, he earned a living as a pianist. After the war, Solti was appointed musical director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1946. In 1952 he moved to the Oper Frankfurt, where he remained in charge for nine years. He took West German citizenship in 1953. In 1961 he became musical director of the Covent Garden Opera Company, London. During his ten-year tenure, he introduced changes that raised standards to the highest international levels. Under his musical directorship the status of the company was recognised with the grant of the title \\"the Royal Opera\\". He became a British citizen in 1972. In 1969 Solti became music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, a post he held for 22 years. He relinquished the position in 1991 and became the orchestra's music director laureate, a position he held until his death. During his time as the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's eighth music director, he also served as music director of the Orchestre de Paris from 1972 until 1975 and principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra from 1979 until 1983.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Was Origin published sooner in Swedish or Italian? Context: The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: To start making a rectangular shaped mold, first gather your materials. You should be able to find the materials for this mold at most craft stores. For this mold, you'll need the following:  Two pieces of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick craft wood, cut into 12\\" by 4\\" length  Two pieces of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick craft wood, cut into 3 1/2″ x 4″ length  One piece of 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick craft wood, cut into 3 1/2″ x 11″ length  Wood clamps  Wood glue You may not find craft wood cut into the exact dimensions you need. You should be able to ask someone at the store to trim the wood down for you. If this option is not available, you can cut most craft wood on your own with a small handsaw.  Measure the wood using a ruler or measuring tape. Draw a line marking the dimensions with a pen or pencil. Use your handsaw to gently saw along that line. If the sides are rough, use sandpaper to smooth them down. Sand paper is rated by grit number. The higher the grit number, the stronger the sandpaper. As craft glue is fairly soft, you do not need a high grit sandpaper for your soap mold. Stick to grit levels below 100, as anything above a 100-level grit is best used on large furniture. Once your wood is cut into the proper dimensions, you can begin assembling your mold. To start, assemble the sides of the wood to form a rectangle.  The 12\\" by 4\\" boards make up the longer sides of the rectangle. The 3 1/2\\" by 4\\" sides make up the shorter sides. The shorter sides will fit inside the longer sides.  Take the 12\\" by 4\\" boards. Place a line of wood glue along each 4\\" side. Then, place the 3 1/2\\" by 4\\" sides between the 12\\" by 4\\" boards, creating a rectangle-shape with your boards. Use the wood clamps to secure while the wood is drying. Once the glue is dry to the touch, and the rectangle feels secure without the wood clamps, you can add the bottom board. The  3 1/2″ x 11″ board fits inside the rectangle. Run some wood glue along each side of the bottom board and then place it inside the rectangle. Use wood clamps to secure the board in place. If your board feels flimsy, use a cordless screwdriver to place four screws into the board where the sides connect. This will further secure the board, as wood glue may loose strength over time. Once you've assembled your board, set is aside and let it dry. To be 100% sure everything is dry, it's best to set your board aside overnight before use. Once you're done creating your board, you can use it to make soap. Make sure to line your board first, as liquid soap will stick to wood. You can use parchment paper or trash bags to line your board. It can take soap anywhere from a few hours to a few days to set. It depends on the soap recipe you're using. Once the soap is set, simply remove it from the board. Set it aside for 3 to 4 weeks to allow it to dry completely. In the event your box leaks, examine the area where the leak is occurring. You can seal this area up with masking tape, duct table, or extra wood glue. Also, you can deal with leaks by lining the box with parchment paper before use.","output":"Creating a rectangular shaped mold requires several pieces of half-inch craft wood, wood clamps, and wood glue. These materials should be readily available at most craft stores. Begin with acquiring the craft wood. You'll need two pieces that are 12 inches by 4 inches, two pieces that are 3 1/2 inches by 4 inches, and one piece that is 3 1/2 inches by 11 inches. If these exact dimensions aren't available, the wood pieces could potentially be trimmed at the store or manually with a small handsaw at home. The steps for manual cutting involve measuring and marking the desired dimensions on the wood, using a handsaw to make a cut along the marked line, and smoothing any rough sides with sandpaper, preferably with a grit of less than 100. Once your wood pieces are ready, you can then assemble your mold. The 12 by 4-inch boards will be the longer sides of your rectangle, while the 3 1/2 by 4-inch sides will form the shorter sides fitting inside the longer ones. Adhere the boards together using wood glue, placing the shorter sides between the longer ones to create a rectangle. Secure this arrangement with wood clamps until the glue dries enough for the structure to hold together without them. After the sides are secure, it's time to attach the bottom board. This is your 3.5 inch by 11-inch piece, which should fit inside the rectangle. Apply wood glue to each side of this board and fit it into the rectangle. Secure it with wood clamps. To enhance the stability of this board, you can use a cordless screwdriver to add four screws into the board where the sides connect. Leave the whole structure to dry, ideally overnight. Once complete, your mold is ready to be used for soap making. Before pouring soap into it, line it to prevent the soap mixture from sticking to the wood: parchment paper or trash bags work well for that. The drying time for the soap varies, depending on the particular soap recipe and can take from a few hours to days until it is set. When it's fully hardened, remove the soap from the mold and let it dry completely for an additional 3 to 4 weeks. In case your mold experiences leaks, inspect the area where the leak happened. You can resolve this issue either by sealing that area with masking tape, duct tape, or extra wood glue, or by lining the box with parchment paper prior to use."},{"instruction":"Where could you see someone pretending to be an action figure but not trying to sell action figures?

The day after unveiling their new bill to replace Obamacare, the Republican authors of the Affordable Health Care Act find themselves in a bind.      Even if the new bill has the votes in the House, it will also have to pass the Senate. Because this legislation is moving forward through the budget reconciliation process, which only requires 51 votes, the 52 Republicans in the Senate can only afford two defections and still pass the bill (assuming Vice President Mike Pence would break a tie in their favor). A third defection would doom the Obamacare replacement package.      And, already, four Senate Republicans have already criticized Speaker Paul Ryan’s first proposal, saying it doesn’t do enough to protect Medicaid beneficiaries. That group consists of Rob Portman (R-OH), Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK). Assuming Democrats stick together in opposition, that moderate bloc of Republicans could torpedo the bill on their own.      But appeasing moderates could carry risk for Republican leadership as well: Conservative senators could defect in protest of a bill they think is too far to the left. The most conservative senators are already blasting the first draft as not doing nearly enough to slow entitlement spending, with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) echoing the arch-conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus who say that the bill amounts to “Obamacare-lite” and leaves too much of Obama’s law intact, including the expansion to Medicaid in place until 2020 and the “Cadillac tax” on health care plans for those with high incomes.      National Review’s John Fund points out the difficult spot that Republican leadership is in on Twitter:      Biggest obstacle to House health bill: 7 GOP senators on fence - 4 who said didn’t adequately protect Medicaid, 3 who say bill too generous — John Fund (@johnfund) March 7, 2017      If anything, Fund’s tweet undersells the challenge leading Republicans face in building the coalition to get to the 51 votes they’ll need at a minimum to get Trumpcare through reconciliation.      It’s not just the fight over Medicaid. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), for instance, has said that the bill has to cover the same number of people as Obamacare. Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) wants it to be neutral, meaning it doesn’t add to the deficit.      \\"I'm going to be very anxious to hear how we'll get to 51 votes and [how] the House gets to 218,\\" said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO).      The Congressional Budget Office hasn’t yet estimated how many people the bill will cover or how much it will cost, key to Cassidy and Corker’s support. But the challenge is obvious from a mile away.      Meanwhile, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Sen. Murkowski say the House health bill should be stripped of its provisions to defund Planned Parenthood.      “If you go too far and have too many drastic cuts, you lose the moderate four,” says Josh Huder, a congressional scholar at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, citing Portman, Caputo, Gardner, and Murkowski. “And if you don’t go far enough, you lose the conservatives.” Republicans need both to get to 51 votes.      It’s perfectly possible either or both factions of Republicans are bluffing, simply hoping to pull the negotiations as far to their side as possible. “There's a high probability of that,” Huder says. That’s what happened during the debate over Obamacare.      In 2010, it looked like then-Majority Leader Harry Reid didn’t have the votes for the Affordable Care Act. Two versions of the bill were shot down after passing separate committees, Democrats like Joe Lieberman threatened to withhold support, and the future of health care reform seemed to be in danger.      Then the bill was reworked — and Reid had the votes. “All of a sudden, Harry Reid dropped a bill on the Senate floor that found the right mixture of people, and then the House swallowed the pill,” Huder says. “It looked like Obamacare was dead in the water — and then all of a sudden it sprang back to life.”      But even if some Republicans are bluffing because they hope to influence what the final bill looks like, the balancing act between conservatives and moderates is a real challenge.      “It’s going to be really, really hard for them to do this,” Huder says. “It’s the key question: Can they find a way to thread the needle here between the moderates and the conservatives in the Senate? There’s no way forward if not.”      Tara Golshan contributed reporting. ||||| White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that what the House GOP released last night is the Obamacare repeal that everyone’s been waiting for.      And while Vice President Mike Pence said today that the White House is “open to improvements,” it’s already getting an icy reception from many on the right. The bill has received criticism from Heritage Action and National Review, and several Republican legislators — including Mike Lee and Rand Paul — have already voiced their concerns.

(March 7) AP      Do we stay with Obamacare and the unsustainable status quo, or do we repeal it and replace it with something better?      House Speaker Paul Ryan (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP)      When I took the speaker’s gavel, I told my colleagues that it’s no longer good enough to just say what we’re against. We had to show what we’re for. That’s why last year we released a complete policy agenda — tracking closely with ideas from our presidential nominee, Donald Trump — to tackle all of the big challenges facing this country. The truth is, we have solutions to all of the many problems that Barack Obama left behind.      And there is no more urgent problem than Obamacare.      The collapsing law is driving up health care costs and driving out choices for American families. This year alone, premiums have gone up by double digits in 31 states. Choices have dwindled to the point that one out of every three counties in America has just one insurer to choose from.      Not too long ago, Bill Clinton called Obamacare “the craziest thing in the world.” He is on to something there.      That’s why we must end this law — repealing it once and for all. But rather than going back to the way things were, we must move to a better system that embraces competition and choice and actually lowers costs for patients and taxpayers.            Introduced this week, the American Health Care Act keeps our promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. I hope you will read the bill online at readthebill.gop.      Our goal is to give every American access to quality, affordable health care. For families, that means lower costs, more choices and greater control. Let me walk you through how our plan will help get us there.      For starters, our bill repeals Obamacare. We cannot rebuild the American health care system on such a flawed foundation, and that’s why we eliminate Obamacare’s taxes, mandates and spending.      Next, and this is important, our plan ensures there will be a stable transition. As we move from a Washington-driven system to a more vibrant market, we will make sure no one has the rug pulled out from under them. This also means we will ensure vital protections for patients with pre-existing conditions and allow young adults to stay on their parents’ plan.      We will also give states more funding and flexibility to support high-risk pools and reinsurance programs. Where Obamacare was built on mandates and coercion that make coverage more expensive, our plan takes care of those in need without driving up costs for everyone else.      Next, while Obamacare just added people to a broken Medicaid system, we will strengthen Medicaid so that states have the tools they need to take care of their poor and most vulnerable populations at a lower cost. Our plan represents the most significant entitlement reform in more than 50 years.      Republicans have long said that we have to empower patients as consumers to spur competition and bring down costs. That’s why we will also nearly double the amount of money you can contribute to health savings accounts to pay for out-of-pocket expenses. This will end Obamacare’s limits on how you save and spend your health care dollars.      POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media      Ultimately, we need a real marketplace for health insurance. Currently, the tax code discriminates against those who don't get coverage through their employer. To level the playing field, our plan offers an advanceable, refundable tax credit to those who don’t get insurance from work or a government program. Instead of mandates forcing you to buy what the government wants, you will have real choices. Available to those under a certain income level, this tax credit will be age-based and portable so that you can take it with you from job to job.            And to help more people buy the kind of plan that fits their needs, we will get rid of costly insurance mandates and regulations.            In the weeks ahead, the House will consider this plan through an open and transparent process, including legislation to allow people to purchase health care across state lines. As we do, I encourage you to read the bill so you can see the changes we are proposing.      Here is the choice we face: Do we stay with Obamacare and the unsustainable status quo, or do we repeal it and replace it with something better?            The American Health Care Act offers a better way. It keeps our promise, begins to clean up the mess Obamacare has made, and builds a better system for all Americans. Now we must deliver.      Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is speaker of the House of Representatives.

House Speaker Paul Ryan has long been the darling of conservative policy wonks. But on one of the biggest days of his political career, when House Republicans released their much-anticipated Obamacare replacement, many of Ryan's closest friends in the conservative intelligentsia expressed disappointment — if not outright dismay — with the legislation bearing the speaker's imprimatur.      Indeed, virtually every prominent conservative health care expert — precisely the sort of ideological allies who have backed Ryan in the past — panned this legislation.      Story Continued Below      The Cato Institute’s Michael Cannon called it “a train wreck waiting to happen.” The American Enterprise Institute’s Jim Capretta told POLITICO the GOP’s decision to do away with a cap on tax credits for employer-based health insurance reflected a reluctance to “deal with reality.” Forbes’ Avik Roy, widely considered one of the pre-eminent health care policy experts on the right, predicted the legislation would make insurance unaffordable for millions of the nation’s poor and offered an analysis with subsections titled, “The Good,” “The Bad” and “The Terrible.” The Wall Street Journal editorial board was the lone dissenter, calling the bill \\"the most consequential GOP social-policy reform since the welfare overhaul of 1996.\\"      “It is remarkable that they’ve produced a bill that is so out of touch with ACA opponents,” Cannon said. “The first rule in these situations is you want to dance with the gal that brung ya. You don’t want to walk away from your base.”      Paul Ryan's spokesperson, AshLee Strong, took issue with that characterization.      \\"The bill is a compilation of reforms conservatives have fought for over many years including Medicaid block grants, HSA expansion, equalized tax treatment for health benefits, and repeal of Obamacare to the full extent reconciliation allows,\\" she said.      Conservatives have never seen eye to eye on just how to go about repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, and, over time, right-leaning Obamacare critics have fallen into two camps: those who favor scrapping Obamacare without providing alternative coverage for its beneficiaries and those who favor replacing Obamacare’s subsidies with a tax credit, either flat or adjusted for the wealth and income of beneficiaries.      The origins of the current debate stretch back to June 2016, when Ryan rolled out his own health care plan as part of a broader policy vision he dubbed “A Better Way.” The plan itself was the result of dozens of conversations with conservative think tankers over the years, and in it, Ryan planted his stake firmly in the camp of those who support replacing the current subsidies with a flat tax credit.      But the Republican-controlled House never voted on the plan and the tensions and disagreements that would normally have surrounded it receded into the background in the midst of the election season.      “There was never a vote or a poll taken on it,” Roy said. In Congress, “people just kind of kept their mouths shut, they didn’t complain about it and didn’t endorse it, they just kind of left it alone.”      Though Ryan's plan sprang from conservative circles — and served as a framework for the current bill — the legislation unveiled on Monday night includes many compromises Ryan's blueprint did not.      As a result, the current GOP bill has managed to rile all three major conservative camps. And a debate that as recently as a year ago was taking place in think tank board rooms and congressional offices is now unfolding on the national stage.      House and Senate leaders seemed tacitly to acknowledge the precarious position they’re in, vowing to push forward as quickly as possible, without a debate in Congress and despite the fact that the Congressional Budget Office hasn't given the bill an official price tag. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday promised a vote on a health care bill by the end of April.      Though few conservative policy wonks harbored the illusion that an Obamacare replacement would not reflect some painful bargaining, they are by and large surprised to see the initial volley riddled with so many compromises, leaving one prominent conservative to lament: “This bill has no friends.”      Perhaps the biggest flash point in the legislation is the 30 percent surcharge on those who allow their insurance coverage to lapse, which has led experts to warn the bill will entrench and exacerbate problems introduced by Obamacare. Roy speculated that origins of the provision lie in reports from several insurance companies, on earnings calls and elsewhere, that those who enroll in Obamacare exchanges outside the regular enrollment period are on average 30 percent costlier to ensure.

Cannon predicted Republican House members would be “hammered” by their constituents who see their health care deteriorate.      “I think if they actually enacted the House bill, they would create a mess in 2017, 2018 and 2019,” Capretta said.      He demurred, though, when asked about the chances that the legislation would make it to the president’s desk. “Normally, leaders of Congress don’t proceed unless they think they have a pretty good chance of success,” he said. “It looks daunting to me but, you know …” ||||| Myth #1: This Amendment does not cover pre-existing conditions.      FACT: The MacArthur Amendment explicitly maintains protections for pre-existing conditions. NO STATE, under ANY circumstances, may ever obtain a waiver for guaranteed issue of coverage, guaranteed renewability of coverage, or the prohibition on denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions. The amendment specifically clarifies that its provisions cannot be construed as allowing insurers to limit coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. All of these protections will remain the law.      Myth #2: This Amendment will price those with pre-existing conditions out of the market, making health care unaffordable for them.      FACT: The amendment’s limited waiver for health rating requires states to set up a program for high-risk individuals or premium stabilization, or to participate in the federal invisible risk sharing program. No state may obtain a waiver for health status unless it has taken these efforts to protect those who might be affected. In states with a waiver, individuals who maintain continuous coverage could not be rated based on health status.      Myth #3: High-risk pools have traditionally been underfunded by states and the federal government, resulting in poor coverage and high costs for those who need insurance the most.      FACT: The AHCA sets aside 100 billion over ten years to help states with high-risk pools and other innovations. It sets aside an additional 15 billion specifically for maternity care, mental health care, and substance abuse treatment. And it sets aside an ADDITIONAL 15 billion for a federal invisible risk-sharing program -- another innovative way to help people access affordable coverage.      Myth #4: Under this amendment, States do not have to cover essential health benefits.      FACT: This amendment ensures essential health benefits are the federal law of the land and maintains other important protections. States have the option to obtain a waiver regarding federal essential health benefits, but the state must publicly attest its purpose for doing so (to reduce the cost of health care coverage, increase the number of people with health care coverage, etc.) and it must specify the benefits it will require instead of the federal standard. NO STATE, under ANY circumstances, may ever obtain a waiver for pre-existing condition protection, prohibition on gender discrimination, for guaranteed issue and renewability, or for the right of dependents to stay on a family plan up to age 26.      Myth #5: 129 Million Americans have pre-existing conditions and could be denied coverage.      FACT: This legislation addresses the 7% of Americans on the individual market, and those in the small group market. Anyone with employer-provided coverage or government coverage (Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, VA benefits, etc.) would not be affected. Again, this amendment would not allow any state to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, and would require the extensive protections described above for those with riskier health profiles. It is also worth noting that many states required insurers to offer coverage to those with pre-existing conditions before Obamacare was implemented. ||||| Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump warned House Republicans Tuesday if they can't pass health care legislation after seven years of promises it could be a \\"bloodbath\\" in the 2018 midterm election, according to one member present in the meeting.      Trump vowed to throw his full support behind the effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act during a meeting with House GOP leadership, saying he is \\"proud\\" to support a GOP-authored plan to replace Obamacare and told members behind closed doors that he would support it \\"100%,\\" according to sources in the room.      But he warned lawmakers of the high-stakes nature of the effort, citing a potential electoral \\"bloodbath,\\" a member present said.      \\"He said he hopes members understand that,\\" the source said.      Despite early opposition from conservative groups and some members of Congress, there was a lot of optimism among the House leadership members charged with passing the legislation that members would come around.      Trump promised House Republicans in the meeting he would use the power of the bully pulpit -- calling and meeting with members -- to get conservatives and moderates in line and pass the bill.      \\"I'm proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives and encouraged by members of both parties,\\" Trump said during brief remarks captured by the press pool.      Republicans first unveiled their legislation, which would eliminate the individual mandate to obtain health insurance contained in Obamacare and include tax incentives meant to encourage Americans to purchase coverage, Monday night.      The gathered lawmakers told the President they faced obstacles ahead without any expectation of Democratic support for their plan, nor any idea of where some conservatives might land. The House GOP vote-counters told Trump they planned to move forward with a whip count later this week      \\"We don't have it today, but I think we'll get it,\\" a source in the room told CNN.      Trump's remarks during the roughly 30-minute meeting with members in the East Room of the White House reflected the most explicit administration endorsement yet of the replacement health care plan.      \\"I cannot comment on the discussions in closed door meetings,\\" said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, when asked about Trump's comments about the political pitfalls of failing to pass a replacement plan.      Trump had not yet weighed in overtly on the Republican plan until Tuesday afternoon. Earlier, he tweeted support for the bill but also suggested there were elements of the measure that could be changed.      JUST WATCHED Spicer compares healthcare bills by size Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Spicer compares healthcare bills by size 01:23      \\"Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation,\\" he wrote Tuesday morning.      Sources in the room told CNN that Trump did not explicitly call out any member or group opposed to the bill, but did emphasize the importance of getting the job done and working together to do it.      \\"We cannot toss this out and start all over. We are too far down the road for that,\\" the source said.      The whip strategy going forward appears to be to remind members again and again that voting against the House's bill is the same as voting against their President, and handing a victory to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. The strategy is to remind members there is no second chance to get this right.      Vice President Mike Pence also joined the meeting and was feeling hopeful about the legislation's prospects in the Senate, sources said, despite the fact that two senators have already come out with deep concerns about the House legislation.      While Trump said he was committed to the bill, he did indicate he was open to making changes. Sources in the room, however, said that the changes would have to win broad support and be passed through the amendment process, making it difficult to amend the contours of the legislation in any meaningful way.      \\"This is a guy who knows how to close a deal, and he thinks we are at the point were we need to close,\\" the source said.      Trump took to Twitter Tuesday evening to reach out to one of the bill's most vocal conservative opponents.      \\"I feel sure that my friend @RandPaul will come along with the new and great health care program because he knows Obamacare is a disaster!\\" Trump tweeted, just as an interview with Sen. Rand Paul was about to air on CNN's Erin Burnett \\"OutFront.\\"      I feel sure that my friend @RandPaul will come along with the new and great health care program because he knows Obamacare is a disaster! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 8, 2017      In that interview taped prior to Trump's tweet, the Kentucky Senator said he met with Trump and didn't believe the two were \\"that far off\\" from each other on how to proceed. Paul said they both want to repeal Obamacare, and the disagreement came over how exactly to replace it -- and whether or not that replacement should be combined with the repeal in one bill.      \\"I did express with the President that I think separating repeal from replacement will get it done, and I think that's maybe the only vehicle for getting that done,\\" Paul said. ||||| Photo: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images      Following the unveiling of the House Republican plan to shrink Obamacare dramatically, two surprising things happened. The first is that the conservative-movement apparatus has lined up rapidly against the bill. The major right-wing pressure groups — Freedom­Works, the Club for Growth, Americans for Prosperity, and Heritage Action for America — all announced opposition, and were quickly echoed by the most right-wing members of Congress, like House Freedom Caucus chair Jim Jordan and Senator Rand Paul. The second surprising thing is that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced his intention to jam the House bill through the Senate quickly. Rather than develop its own bills through committees and the normal debate process, McConnell declared he plans to bring it directly to the Senate floor. Neither of these decisions makes a great deal of sense on their own, and they make even less sense in conjunction with each other.      The grounds for the right’s opposition is that the House bill would replace Obamacare with a “new entitlement,” albeit one funded almost entirely through cuts to an old entitlement (Medicaid) and which would provide such meager benefits as to be useless to large numbers of its purported beneficiaries.      What makes this revolt so confounding to the party leadership is that the House bill, while too liberal for the party’s right flank, is also almost certainly too conservative to pass the Senate. Senators Lisa Murkowski, Cory Gardner, Rob Portman, and Shelly Moore Capito signed a letter yesterday opposing the bill’s repeal of the Medicaid expansion. A fifth, Dean Heller, has raised concerns about protecting Medicaid. Susan Collins and Bill Cassidy have proposed a much more moderate replacement bill, which has also been co-sponsored by Capito and Johnny Isakson. Additionally, Lamar Alexander, Jeff Flake, and Lindsey Graham have urged caution and deliberation — all of which run counter to the leadership’s strategy of ramming a bill through as quickly as possible in order to enable the passage of a big tax cut later in the year.      That makes 11 Republican senators who have, in some form or fashion, expressed reservations about the party leadership’s preferred health care strategy. Even assuming the three senators who object to the law from the right — Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee — can be corralled, Trumpcare seems to be very far from corralling the necessary 50 Senate votes. And this is before the Congressional Budget Office produces its score, which will probably show millions and millions of people losing coverage, and may possibly also show the deficit blowing up.      While McConnell’s plan might be necessary in order to keep the party’s legislative strategy on track, it is highly and even delusionally optimistic, given the state of his vote count. It also runs counter to the Senate’s institutional culture. Senators cherish their power to shape and control legislation. A strategy of photocopying the House bill and ramming it through seems almost designed to violate the Senatorial ego.      This raises a question: Is it designed to violate the Senatorial ego? And thus to fail? Neither the conservative revolt nor McConnell’s plan make a lot of sense if you view them as strategies designed to yield the most right-wing health-care policy that is attainable. They do make sense as a strategy designed to insulate Republicans from failure.      Republicans have made two promises that can’t be reconciled. They promised to repeal Obamacare, and to replace it with a terrific law that would take care of everybody. As the House Republican ad put it, they promised, “more choices and better care, at lower costs. … peace of mind to people with preexisting conditions … without disrupting existing coverage.” Those things cannot be reconciled. If Republicans repeal Obamacare, they will put in place something that not only fails to provide the better, cheaper care they have promised the country, but does not meet even the minimal threshold of access to basic care for people who currently receive it.      From that standpoint, the winning play for the GOP might be to try to repeal and replace Obamacare but fail. If they are seen trying and failing to repeal the law, it might upset the base, but most Republican lawmakers will have their opposition to Obamacare on the record. And if it is to fail, it should fail quickly, so they can move on to cutting taxes.      This may all be wrong. It is never safe to assume rational thought on the part of public actors, especially in the reality-distortion field of Trump’s Washington. Maybe ultra-conservatives think they are using their leverage to push the bill to the right. Or maybe McConnell believes he can whip his caucus into line. Whatever the explanation, the strategy behind the bill is almost as incompetent as the bill itself. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Republicans are divided over the newly proposed Affordable Health Care Act, which aims to replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.

The final large reception room on the first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636–1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.Leading from the Library is the Queen's Room, the former \\"Best Bed Chamber\\".

Can a photo competition change the world? Probably not, but when paired with the brainpower of IBM and the problem-solving capabilities of the world's most advanced artificially intelligent computer systems, it might just stand a chance. Last November, IBM opened its 12th global research lab -- and first on the African continent -- in Nairobi, Kenya. Though the lab employs 25 PhDs from the world's best universities, as well as Watson -- the AI supercomputer that won Jeopardy against human competitors in 2011 -- the company recognized that in order to truly shape innovation in the continent, it had to first hear from the people who live there. \\"If we're going to solve the grand challenges of Africa it has to start here in Africa with us identifying and underscoring what they are,\\" says Erik Hersman, founder of Nairobi's iHub tech hub and CEO of BRCK, and one of the four photo contest judges. To better understand what areas to invest in, IBM launched its The World is Our Lab photo competition, which invited anyone with a camera (or mobile phone) to contribute images that highlight the continent's grand challenges, city systems and examples of innovation. After three months (and 1,200 submissions), they chose a winner in each of those three categories. The competition even succeeded in offering the judges a few surprises. \\"I saw places in Nigeria I didn't even imagine existed,\\" says Kenyan Mutua Matheka, official photographer for The World is Our Lab project and another judge in the competition. \\"The winners each shared an Africa that most of us didn't know or didn't have access to.\\" Kenyan TV producer Frank Odwesso won in the City System category with his image of a woman on the back of a \\"boda boda,\\" or bicycle taxi. The judges felt the picture demonstrated how locals in Western Kenya and Nyanza circumvent an unreliable public transport system to create a more efficient means of getting around. Mainly, though, it was the strength of the image that they were drawn to. \\"It had the most vibrant colors, and it really summed up Africa to me,\\" admits Matheka. See the best photos from the competition here. Imole \\"Tobbie\\" Balogun won the Grand Challenges category with \\"Baby Sitting,\\" which highlights the very adult responsibilities imposed on many of Nigeria's children -- either because poverty forces them into jumpstarting their working lives, or because they have to assume the role of caretaker for their siblings. Visual artist Lawrence \\"Shabu\\" Mwangi won the Innovation category, and the competition overall, with \\"Digital Migration,\\" a shot he took of children playing with scrap in Nairobi's Mukuru slum. \\"We have these big dumping sites in Mukuru, and though we try to prevent the kids going to them, they find a way and use the scrap to play with,\\" says Mwangi, who also grew up in the area. \\"These kids were playing a role in the television. None of them have a TV at home, but here they had a chance to be reporters -- they could be anything they wanted to be within that television. I just wanted to capture the happiness in that moment,\\" he adds. See more from Inside Africa. The competition is part of IBM's 100 million Project Lucy initiative, which will employ Watson and other cognitive computing technologies to advance development and create business opportunities in Africa over the next 10 years. Matheka, a former architect and one of the continent's most respected photographers, says the competition has also shown him how photography has grown in Africa. \\"I feel like a lot of African photographers have observed how those in Europe and the U.S. have photographed in Africa, and many us still use that as a template of how Africa should be captured. I think we're starting to get out of that now,\\" he says. \\"I think photography is starting to feel more approachable, to include the African public and focus on the textures and people of Africa. We're starting to tell stories for Africans. It's important, because our stories matter, and we need to hear them and to see our heroes so that we can know what is possible.\\" What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

Crying is a reaction caused by a heightened state of emotions and the relaxing effects of breathing can help you to stop yourself from crying. Perhaps you've just thought of a sad memory, you've been broken up with, or something tragic has happened in your life. Can we draw the following conclusion? Crying is a result in a shift of mood.","output":"Step 1: Understand the user's need to stop crying: In this case, they are looking for ways to cope with a heightened emotional state. Step 2: Consider the provided information: The user mentioned focusing on breathing to try to stop crying, as well as some potential reasons for crying, such as sad memories, breakups, or tragic life events. Step 3: Analyze the claim made by the user: \\"Crying is a result in a shift of mood.\\" Step 4: Compare the claim to the information provided: While it is true that crying is often associated with a shift in mood, it's important to note that the reasons for crying can vary, and it is not solely tied to a shift in mood. For instance, people might cry due to physical pain or other factors not directly related to mood. Step 5: Reframe the claim to accurately represent the information: From the steps above, it would be more accurate to say, \\"Crying can be a result of a shift in mood, particularly when a person experiences heightened emotions.\\" In conclusion, while crying can be a result of a shift in mood, it is essential to consider other factors that could lead to crying, such as physical pain or situations unrelated to mood changes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How will abolishing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes affect the real estate businesses in India? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The questions are essentially asking the same thing, but they are phrased differently. Both questions inquire about the effects of demonetizing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes on the real estate industry in India. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the impact: Step 1: Understand the context - In November 2016, the Indian Government announced the demonetization of the existing Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 currency notes to curb black money and counterfeit currency in circulation. Step 2: Evaluate the role of cash in the real estate industry - The Indian real estate sector is traditionally known for having a significant amount of cash-based transactions, with the intention of avoiding taxes or using unaccounted money. Step 3: Assess the immediate impact - The demonetization move led to a liquidity crunch as these Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes accounted for around 86% of the currency in circulation at that time. This affected various sectors of the economy, including real estate businesses. Step 4: Analyze the effect on different segments of the real estate market - The luxury and high-end segment, where cash transactions were more prevalent, experienced a significant slowdown. - The affordable housing segment, which is largely driven by home loans and had fewer cash transactions, was less affected. Step 5: Consider the long-term implications - The demonetization drive led to greater transparency and formalization in the real estate sector as more transactions shifted towards digital payments and banking channels. - Property prices stabilized or fell in some markets due to reduced demand and increased accountability. - Increased emphasis on affordable housing and government incentives also helped revive the real estate market in the long run. In summary, the demonetization of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes had a significant impact on the Indian real estate industry, particularly in the high-end and luxury segments. This move towards transparency and formalization helped the industry to evolve and become more accountable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

To do this, we can perform the following steps: Step 1: Subtract 54 from both sides of the equation. This reverses the addition of 54 and helps isolate the term with z. 0 - 54 = -18 * z + 54 - 54 -54 = -18 * z Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by -18.

Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.  Question: \\"Where was Mohamed Atta born and what university did he attend to get and architect degree?\\" Answer: \\"Cairo University\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct.

Write some highlights for the following article: For 11 years, Pedro Zapeta, an illegal immigrant from Guatemala, lived his version of the American dream in Stuart, Florida: washing dishes and living frugally to bring money back to his home country. Pedro Zapeta, an illegal immigrant, managed to save 59,000 while working as a dishwasher for 11 years. Two years ago, Zapeta was ready to return to Guatemala, so he carried a duffel bag filled with 59,000 -- all the cash he had scrimped and saved over the years -- to the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. But when Zapeta tried to go through airport security, an officer spotted the money in the bag and called U.S. customs officials. \\"They asked me how much money I had,\\" Zapeta recalled, speaking to CNN in Spanish. He told the customs officials 59,000. At that point, U.S. customs seized his money, setting off a two-year struggle for Zapeta to get it back.  Zapeta describes how he lost his money ». Zapeta, who speaks no English, said he didn't know he was running afoul of U.S. law by failing to declare he was carrying more than 10,000 with him. Anyone entering or leaving the country with more than 10,000 has to fill out a one-page form declaring the money to U.S. customs. Officials initially accused Zapeta of being a courier for the drug trade, but they dropped the allegation once he produced pay stubs from restaurants where he had worked. Zapeta earned 5.50 an hour at most of the places where he washed dishes. When he learned to do more, he got a 25-cent raise. After customs officials seized the money, they turned Zapeta over to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The INS released him but began deportation proceedings. For two years, Zapeta has had two attorneys working pro bono: one on his immigration case, the other trying to get his money back. \\"They are treating me like a criminal when all I am is a working man,\\" he said. Zapeta's story became public last year on CNN and in The Palm Beach Post newspaper, prompting well-wishers to give him nearly 10,000 -- money that now sits in a trust. Robert Gershman, one of Zapeta's attorneys, said federal prosecutors later offered his client a deal: He could take 10,000 of the original cash seized, plus 9,000 in donations as long as he didn't talk publicly and left the country immediately. Zapeta said, \\"No.\\" He wanted all his money. He'd earned it, he said. Now, according to Gershman, the Internal Revenue Service wants access to the donated cash to cover taxes on the donations and on the money Zapeta made as a dishwasher. Zapeta admits he never paid taxes. CNN contacted the U.S. Attorneys office in Miami, U.S. Customs and the IRS about Zapeta's case. They all declined to comment. Marisol Zequeira, an immigration lawyer, said illegal immigrants such as Zapeta have few options when dealing with the U.S. government. \\"When you are poor, uneducated and illegal, your avenues are cut,\\" he said. On Wednesday, Zapeta went to immigration court and got more bad news. The judge gave the dishwasher until the end of January to leave the country on his own. He's unlikely to see a penny of his money. \\"I am desperate,\\" Zapeta said. \\"I no longer feel good about this country.\\" Zapeta said his goal in coming to the United States was to make enough money to buy land in his mountain village and build a home for his mother and sisters. He sent no money back to Guatemala over the years, he said, and planned to bring it all home at once. At Wednesday's hearing, Zapeta was given official status in the United States -- voluntary departure -- and a signed order from a judge. For the first time, he can work legally in the U.S. By the end of January, Zapeta may be able to earn enough money to pay for a one-way ticket home so the U.S. government, which seized his 59,000, doesn't have to do so.

She was wearing her bug glasses--huge dark things with lenses that bulged out like fly eyes and reflected my face like a fun-house mirror.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? cold , nervy and memorable .","output":"The phrase \\"cold, nervy, and memorable\\" is a combination of words carrying different emotional connotations, making it difficult to categorize it as strictly positive or negative. Each of these words contains its own inferences, which we will analyze in depth below to determine the overall sentiment. 1. Cold: The adjective “cold” may have a few possible interpretations depending on the context in which it is used. In a positive sense, it could imply that something is cool, calm, and collected. However, it might also be interpreted negatively, as it could suggest being unemotional, unsympathetic, or unwelcoming. The word 'cold,' in general, leans more towards a negative connotation, as it often evokes feelings of discomfort, detachment, or aloofness. 2. Nervy: The term \\"nervy\\" is also ambivalent. On one hand, it can refer to someone or something that displays courage, boldness, or gutsiness, which would be considered positive qualities. On the other hand, it might also imply feelings of anxiety, agitation, or nervousness, which are generally regarded as negative emotions. The interpretation of \\"nervy\\" depends on the context in which it is used; it can be seen positively or negatively based on the situation and the perspective of the person reading or hearing this term. 3. Memorable: Lastly, the word \\"memorable\\" is generally considered as a positive adjective. It suggests that something has left a lasting impression or has a significant impact, making it worthy of being remembered. Events, experiences, or people described as memorable are those that stand out for their uniqueness or importance and are cherished or recalled fondly. Considering the varied emotional connotations of the individual words, the phrase \\"cold, nervy, and memorable\\" is not easily classified as either positive or negative. The sentiment conveyed will depend largely on the context in which these words are used and the way the reader or listener perceives them.

It’s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque. I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges).

For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965. The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382 the property, then called Well-street, was sold by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial, brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill's purchase described it as an \\"imposing\\" mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was largely rebuilt and extended by the society architect Philip Tilden. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \\"the most beautiful and charming\\" Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house. In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to again consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who witnessed a performance by a rude singer? , can you please find it?   Andy Kaufman is a struggling performer whose act fails in nightclubs because, while the audience wants comedy, he sings children's songs and refuses to tell conventional jokes. As the audience begins to believe that Kaufman may have no real talent, his previously timid \\"foreign man\\" character puts on a rhinestone jacket and does a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The audience bursts into applause, realizing Kaufman had tricked them. He catches the eye of talent agent George Shapiro, who signs Kaufman as a client and immediately lands him a network TV series, Taxi, much to Kaufman's dismay, since he dislikes sitcoms. Because of the money, visibility, and a promise that he can do his own television special, Kaufman accepts the role, turning his foreign man into a mechanic named Latka Gravas. Secretly he hates doing the show and expresses a desire to quit. Invited to catch a different act at a nightclub, Shapiro witnesses a performance by a rude, loud-mouthed lounge singer, Tony Clifton, whom Kaufman wants to guest-star on Taxi. Clifton's bad attitude is matched by his horrible appearance and demeanor. But backstage, when he meets Shapiro in person, Clifton takes off his sunglasses and reveals that he is actually Kaufman. Clifton is a \\"villain character\\" created by Kaufman and his creative partner, Bob Zmuda. Once again, the gag is on the audience. Kaufman's profile increases with appearances on Saturday Night Live, but he has problems with his newfound fame. When performing live, audiences dislike his strange anti-humor and demand that he perform as Latka. At one show, he deliberately antagonizes attendees by reading The Great Gatsby aloud from start to finish.

Fraternity failed to seek medical help for nearly an hour, police claim. Freshman suffered 'major brain trauma' after being knocked unconscious.","output":"Title: The Untimely Death of Chen Deng: A Tale of University Fraternity Negligence In a shocking turn of events last week, a promising young student named Chen Deng lost his life, allegedly due to fraternity negligence. According to the police report, the fraternity members allegedly failed to seek prompt medical help for nearly an hour after Deng's condition severely deteriorated. The event marked yet another reminder of the potential dangers hidden behind the fraternity culture in our universities. Chen Deng, a lively and enthusiastic freshman, tragically passed away after enduring 'major brain trauma', as confirmed by the medics who attended to him. The trauma was reportedly as a result of Chen being knocked unconscious, which plunged the fraternity house into chaos. However, what transpired afterwards calls for deep reflection on the response culture amongst fraternity brothers. The police claim that Deng was taken to the hospital by his fellow fraternity members. Yet, it is alleged that what is alarming is the fraternity's failure to act promptly when their fellow member’s health was clearly in a critical condition. The distressing delay stretched for nearly an hour, during which time Deng’s condition was progressively worsening.  The subsequent investigation revealed that the fraternity body's response was not quick enough to save their fellow mate. An entire hour elapsed before Deng was finally brought to the hospital, thus delaying the necessary medical assistance that could potentially have prevented the situation from escalating to the horrific level it ultimately reached. This delay represents a catastrophic failure of the moral responsibilities held by, not just fraternity members, but by all students living in close proximity. This dark incident has shone a new spotlight on fraternity culture across college campuses. It raises pertinent questions about the safety measures in place, the efficiency of fraternity emergency response strategies, and the care given to students off-campus, particularly those involved in Greek life organizations. The degree of the fraternity’s negligence is undeniable. The lack of immediate emergency response shown towards Chen's situation was not only inadequate; it was perilous and ultimately fatal. This tragic event has devastated a family, robbed a young man of his dreams, and brought about deep-seated regret and disturbance within the university community. Equally shocking is the casualness with which fraternity practices are conducted that can lead to such grave harm, as with the incident that led to Chen's unconsciousness. As a result of this event, universities nationwide must re-evaluate their fraternity oversight policies, significantly increasing the supervision and monitoring of fraternity activities to safeguard the safety and lives of the students involved in such organizations. As we mourn the tragic loss of Chen Deng, it is pivotal to understand that this incident is not an isolated event. This unfortunate time calls for a much-needed dialogue regarding the upkeep and betterment of student safety within the fraternity culture. In its wake, Chen Deng’s untimely demise triggers reflections on fraternity practices and the cavalier attitudes that, unfortunately, sometimes accompany them. The incident also calls for a greater sense of fraternity responsibility towards the wellbeing of each member. In the spirit of brotherhood, students must be prepared to support one another, even in dire times. To prevent incidents like this from recurring in the future, it is of paramount importance for fraternity bodies and university authorities to work together. This includes devising a set of safety protocols, providing compulsory emergency response training to all fraternity members and encouraging a culture of prompt action in emergency situations within the fraternity culture. Remembering Chen Deng and his untimely death should serve as a powerful reminder to all of us that swift action can be life-saving. In the end, we all have a role to play, and we must question if we are doing enough to ensure student safety on our campuses. In the sea of university life, no more should a student feel forgotten, neglected, or unimportant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Though female condoms typically cost around 4 per condom and can only be used once, you should practice using the condom on your own instead of using it for the first time right before sex. Though inserting the condom is easy once you get the hang of it, you should try it on your own at least once or twice to make sure that you can get it right when the time comes. Once you've determined that the condom is ready for use, just tear the arrow at the top of the package and remove the female condom. Using spermicides along with the female condom can further reduce your risk of pregnancy. Though the female condom will already be lubricated, extra lubricant can make it easier to insert and use the condom. To insert the female condom, you'll have to find a position that works for you. It's just like inserting a tampon -- you have to get comfortable and have access to your vagina before you can insert the condom. You can try squatting on the ground, laying down, or placing one foot on top of a chair. Hold the sides together similarly to how you would hold a pencil. Though the condom will be a bit slippery because of the lubricant, make sure you have a reasonably firm grip before you insert it. Insert it like a tampon. Push it up with your finger. Once it reaches the cervix, it will naturally expand and you won't be able to feel it anymore. Again, this is much like inserting a tampon -- if you can still feel it inside you, then you didn't put it in correctly. Make sure that the outer ring is hanging at least an inch outside the vagina. If it's hanging much further out, you may need to check if the inner ring is really inserted correctly. Once you've inserted the condom and are ready for sex, have your partner guide his penis into the outer ring that is hanging outside of your vagina. You can help guide his penis into the condom correctly. Make sure that his penis is actually going into the condom instead of touching one wall of your vagina as well as the condom. It's normal for the female condom to move from side to side once you're having sex. As long as the inner ring is still inserted and your man's penis is in the condom, you're good to go. If his penis has slipped out or the condom has come loose, you can comfortably reinsert it as long as the man hasn't ejaculated yet. Once the man ejaculates, you can remove and throw out the female condom. If you hear a loud noise because of the condom during sex, you can apply more lubricant.","output":"The article provides a detailed guide on how to correctly use a female condom for safe sex, insisting on practicing its use and placement initially to familiarize oneself with the process which is compared with inserting a tampon; it suggests various positioning techniques, importance of right grip and confirmatory pointers to ensure correct placement including the condom's outer ring hanging outside the vagina. The text emphasizes proper guidance of the male partner's penis into the condom, addresses common observations like the condom's movement during sex, and outlines measures for situations such as slippage or loud noise, finally advising on its disposal post the male partner's ejaculation. The use of spermicides and extra lubrication are mentioned to enhance efficiency and ease of use, while the cost and single use nature of these condoms are mentioned briefly."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered a thinly veiled criticism of China, even while insisting on closer relations with Beijing, during a speech Friday in Singapore.  Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size.  \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\"  While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.

Although the team had a slow start to the 2008-09 season, United won the Premier League with a game to spare, making Ferguson the first manager in the history of English football to win the Premier League three times consecutively, on two separate occasions. Ferguson had now won 11 league titles at Manchester United, and the 2008-09 season title success put them level with Liverpool as league champions on a record 18 occasions in total.

Pick from: A). No B). Yes Answer:","output":"A). No The six ecological seasons are not a reasonable answer to the question about what months are in each season. Instead, a more appropriate answer should detail which months typically correspond to each of the four commonly recognized seasons in temperate regions: 1. Spring: This season typically occurs between March and May in the Northern Hemisphere and September and November in the Southern Hemisphere. Spring is characterized by warmer temperatures, increased daylight, and the revival of plants and flowers after the winter months. 2. Summer: Summer occurs between June and August in the Northern Hemisphere and December to February in the Southern Hemisphere. This season experiences the warmest temperatures, longest days, and is often marked by vacations and outdoor activities. 3. Autumn/Fall: This season takes place between September and November in the Northern Hemisphere and March and May in the Southern Hemisphere. Autumn is characterized by cooling temperatures, leaves changing colors, and shorter days. 4. Winter: Winter occurs between December and February in the Northern Hemisphere and June to August in the Southern Hemisphere. In this season, temperatures are at their lowest, and days are shorter, often accompanied by snow, ice, and cold weather. The six ecological seasons you mentioned are a concept in some Indigenous cultures, particularly in Australia, where the climate and natural environment differ from the temperate regions that adhere to the four seasons. However, these do not answer the question about the months associated with the more commonly recognized four seasons."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article using the following points: Dell 'Super Dell' Schanze, 45, is known in Utah for his over-the-top personal style and the shrill, hyperactive TV commercials. He is accused of knowingly using an aircraft to harass wildlife and pursuing a migratory bird.","output":"Title: High-Flying Controversy: The Bizarre Case of Utah's 'Super Dell' Schanze Introduction Dell 'Super Dell' Schanze, a 45-year-old businessman from Utah, has recently been accused of using an aircraft to harass wildlife, as well as pursuing a migratory bird. Schanze, who is widely known throughout the state for his flamboyant personal style and his manic, attention-grabbing TV commericals, now finds himself in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. This article will provide an in-depth examination of the allegations against Schanze and explore the potential implications of these bizarre charges. The Birth of 'Super Dell' Dell Schanze rose to prominence in Utah as the owner and spokesperson of a chain of computer stores called Totally Awesome Computers. Schanze's eccentric, high-energy TV commercials featured the businessman performing outrageous stunts, such as firing the computers from a cannon, to promote his products. As a result, Schanze's persona as the \\"Super Dell,\\" a superhero character who literally fights for the best computer deals, was born. While these commercials were undeniably successful in establishing Schanze as a household name throughout Utah, they also earned him a fair share of critics, many of whom argued that his antics were more annoying than entertaining. The Wildlife Harassment Allegations In recent years, however, the discussions surrounding Schanze have pivoted from his eccentric marketing style to a series of more troubling allegations. According to law enforcement officials, Schanze has been accused of knowingly employing an aircraft to harass wildlife and pursuing a migratory bird, which is, by law, a protected creature. The unorthodox businessman has vehemently denied these allegations, insisting that he has never taken part in any such activities. Instead, Schanze claims that the charges are a politically motivated attempt to tarnish his reputation, spurred on by his vocal criticism of the local government and certain regulatory agencies. Legal Ramifications Should Schanze be found guilty of these wildlife harassment charges, however, the consequences could be severe. Not only would the businessman risk losing public favor, but he could also face both significant fines and potential prison time. Typically, wildlife harassment is considered a highly illegal activity, particularly when it pertains to the harassment of protected species. Furthermore, Schanze could be banned from piloting an aircraft altogether, placing even more strain on the entrepreneur's already notorious public image. Public Opinion While the eventual legal outcome of this case has yet to be determined, it is clear that Schanze's reputation has been greatly impacted by these allegations. Many Utah residents have commented on the case, expressing dismay at the thought of a once-adored local hero abusing his power and prominence in such a reckless, harmful manner. Others, however, have remained steadfast in their support for Schanze, suggesting that the accusations are little more than an attempt to bring down a vocal critic of local government. Conclusion The case of Dell 'Super Dell' Schanze is undoubtedly a complex and compelling one, touching on broader questions of public perception, political persecution, and wildlife conservation. Whether Schanze is ultimately found guilty or exonerated, the case will likely remain an important cultural touchstone as Utah grapples with the controversies surrounding its most famous and flamboyant businessman. As more information emerges, it remains to be seen if 'Super Dell' can maintain any semblance of his once seemingly invincible persona or if his high-flying antics have finally landed him in irreparable trouble."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Yet, even through October, Bermuda isn't ready to stop for the winter. During this month, world-class festivals on teh island keep things lively and the weather remains comfortable enough for Bermuda shorts and bathing suits. In October, Bermuda hosts two major festivals--the Bermuda Music Festival and the Bermuda Culinary Arts  Festival. The 10thanniversary Bermuda Music Festival begins October 5 and features three days of performances at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Bermuda's West End. Featured main stage performers include Joss Stone, Pattie Labelle, and Al Green, and a second stage spotlights local Bermudian artists. General admission tickets start at 60 for on e day  or 160 for a three-day pass. Starting October 21, the Culinary Arts Festival brings some of North America's top chefs to the island for four days of food and wine tastings, conferences and cooking competitions. Participating chefs include Todd English and Michael Lomonaco, among others. Three-day festival passes start at 649 per person, but you can also buy separate tickets for individual events. Even if you don't attend one of the festivals, there's still plenty to do. With mostly sunny days and temperatures averaging aroung 79 degrees, the weather is just right for participating in Bermuda's two favorite pastimes--golf and tennis. With fewer visitors on the island than during the summer, you may have an easier time getting the best times or a spot on the courts. It's also still warm enough to enjoy the island's pink sand beaches and go swimming, because the water keeps the summer's heat longer than the air.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: To make a loop in a piece of copper wire, you can","output":"To determine the best solution for making a loop in a piece of copper wire, the following steps will be taken: Step 1: Identifying potential solutions First, we need to identify the possible techniques available to make a loop in a piece of copper wire. Some potential solutions can be: a) bending the wire by hand, b) using pliers to form the loop, and c) using a specialized wire-bending jig. Step 2: Analyzing each solution Now that we have possible solutions, let's analyze them: a) Bending the wire by hand: Pros: Quick and straightforward, no special tools required. Cons: Difficult to create a consistent and precise loop shape, may not be effective for thicker wires, and may leave rough edges which could result in a weak loop. b) Using pliers to form the loop: Pros: Provides more control and precision than bending by hand, can effectively bend thicker wires, and can help create a smoother edge. Cons: May require some practice for first-time users, and can still be challenging to create a consistent loop shape. c) Using a specialized wire-bending jig: Pros: Offers maximum control and precision in shaping loops, can create consistent and repetitive loop shapes, and can handle a wide range of wire thickness. Cons: Requires purchasing a specialized tool. Step 3: Comparing solutions Considering the pros and cons above, we can compare and rank the solutions based on their effectiveness: 1. Using a specialized wire-bending jig appears to be the best solution because it offers maximum control, precision, and the ability to create consistent loops. However, it requires the purchase of a specialized tool. 2. Using pliers to form the loop comes in second place, as it provides more control than bending by hand but still may require practice for precise and consistent loops. 3. Bending the wire by hand is the least effective method, as it lacks precision and may result in rough edges or weak loops, especially for thicker wires. Conclusion: The best solution for making a loop in a piece of copper wire depends on the specific situation. If precision and consistency are important, and investing in a specialized tool is feasible, using a wire-bending jig is the best option. If only occasional loops are needed or there are budget constraints, the use of pliers may be a suitable compromise. Finally, if no tools are available and the loop is not required to be precise, bending the wire by hand may be the only option."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota says 14 of the city's 23 subway lines are to be operating Thursday with service restoration to continue as the days go on.      None of the trains are going into lower Manhattan, which is still dealing with a massive blackout. But commuters can at least be happy about the price. Gov. Andrew Cuomo waived fares through Friday.      The subways carry 5.2 million riders daily. The Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North each were providing limited service. They have 300,000 daily riders.      THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below.      The cleanup of miles of New Jersey shorefront ripped apart by Superstorm Sandy has just begun, but New York City moved closer to resuming its normal frenetic pace by getting back its vital subways.      New Yorkers began lining up at subway stops by 5 a.m. Thursday, an hour before the storm-crippled subways were to start running. The predawn commuters waiting at platforms included construction workers, shop owners and executives.      The decision to reopen undamaged parts of the nation's largest transit system came as the region struggled to find its way back from a storm that killed more than 70 people and left more than 5 million without power.      Two of the region's main airports opened Wednesday and officials promised that the third, LaGuardia Airport, would return to service Thursday. Actors and eager audiences brought darkened Broadway theaters back to life. And New Yorkers packed on to buses that returned for the first time to city streets since the storm, joining a throng of gridlocked traffic that navigated the city without working stop lights.      Across the region, people stricken by the storm pulled together, in some cases providing comfort to those left homeless, in others offering hot showers and electrical outlets for charging cellphones to those without power.      The spirit of can-do partnership extended even to politicians, who at least made the appearance of putting their differences aside to focus together on Sandy.      \\"We are here for you,\\" President Barack Obama said in Brigantine, N.J., touring a ravaged shore. \\"We are not going to tolerate red tape. We are not going to tolerate bureaucracy.\\"      Obama joined Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who had been one of the most vocal supporters of Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, to tour the ravaged coast. But the two men spoke only of helping those harmed by the storm.      That was already beginning Wednesday, when masses of people walked shoulder-to-shoulder across the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan for work, reversing the escape scenes from the Sept. 11 terror attack and the blackout of 2003. They reached an island, where many people took the lack of power and water and transportation as a personal challenge.      On Third Avenue, people gathered like refugees around a campfire. But instead of crackling flames, their warmth came from more advanced technology: a power strip that had been offered to charge cellphones.      At a fire hydrant on West 16th Street, 9-year-old Shiyin Ge and her brother, 12-year-old Shiyuan Ge, stood in line to fill up buckets of water. But unlike the adults, the two kids held plastic Halloween candy pails painted with grinning jack-o-lanterns.      \\"There's no water in our house,\\" said Shiyin Ge, who had planned to dress up as a ladybug for Halloween.      After suffering the worst disaster in its 108-year-old history, the subways were to roll again _ at least some of them. More than a dozen of the lines would offer some service, but none below Manhattan's 34th Street, a line of demarcation in the city separating the hardest-hit residents from those who escaped the brunt.      Downtown Manhattan, which includes the city's financial district, Sept. 11 memorial and other tourist sites, was still mostly an urban landscape of shuttered bodegas and boarded-up restaurants, where people roamed in search of food, power and a hot shower.      To get there from Brooklyn or Queens, commuters who would normally zoom beneath the East River in tunnels that flooded will have to take shuttle buses, adding to the enormous stress already being placed on gridlocked Manhattan streets.      \\"We are going to need some patience and tolerance,\\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday.      The airports and subways weren't the only transportation systems returning to the region. Suburban trains started running for the first time on Wednesday, and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor was to take commuters from city to city for on Friday for the first time since the storm.      From West Virginia to the Jersey Shore, the storm's damage was still being felt, and seen.      In New Jersey, signs of the good life that had defined wealthy shorefront enclaves like Bayhead and Mantoloking lay scattered and broken: 3,000 barbecue grills buried beneath the sand and hot tubs cracked and filled with seawater. Nearly all the homes were seriously damaged, and many had entirely disappeared.      \\"This,\\" said Harry Typaldos, who owns the Grenville Inn in Mantoloking, \\"I just can't comprehend.\\"      Most of the state's mass transit systems remained shut down, leaving hundreds of thousands of commuters braving clogged highways and quarter-mile lines at gas stations. Atlantic City's casinos remained closed. Christie postponed Halloween until Monday, saying trick-or-treating wasn't safe in towns with flooded and darkened streets, fallen trees and downed power lines.      Farther north in Hoboken, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, nearly 20,000 residents remained stranded in their homes, amid accusations that officials have been slow to deliver food and water. One man blew up an air mattress and floated to City Hall, demanding to know why supplies hadn't gotten out. At least one-fourth of the city's residents are flooded and 90 percent are without power.      The outages forced many gas stations across the state to close, resulting in long lines of people looking to fuel cars and backup generators. Darryl Jameson of Toms River waited more than hour to get fuel.      \\"The messed up part is these people who are blocking the roadway as they try to cut in line,\\" he said. \\"No one likes waiting, man, but it's something you have to do.\\"      On New York's Long Island, bulldozers scooped sand off streets and tow trucks hauled away destroyed cars, while residents tried to find a way to their homes to restart their lives. Joanne and Richard Kalb used a rowboat to reach their home in Mastic Beach, filled with 3 feet of water.      Her husband, exasperated by the futility of their effort, posted a sign on a telephone pole, asking drivers to slow down: \\"Slow please no wake.\\"      Snow drifts as high as 5 feet piled up in West Virginia, where the former Hurricane Sandy merged with two winter weather systems as it went inland. Heavy snow collapsed parts of an apartment complex, a grocery store, a hardwood plant and three homes. The sixth person killed in the state was a candidate for the state House of Delegates, John Rose Sr., who was struck by a falling tree limb. His name will remain on the ballot on Election Day.      A few more inches might fall in West Virginia, but meteorologists said Sandy's days are numbered. The National Weather Service said Wednesday that the last remnants of the storm are in the Appalachian Mountains, and will be gone by the end of the week.      ___      Contributing to this report were Verena Dobnik, Eileen AJ Connelly, Leanne Italie, Karen Matthews and Lou Ferrara in New York; Samantha Henry in Hoboken, N.J.; Wayne Parry in Mantoloking, N.J., Katie Zezima in Seaside Heights, N.J.; Frank Eltman in Mastic Beach, N.Y., Larry Neumeister in Long Beach, N.Y., and Vicki Smith in Elkins, W.Va. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Given the question: This article: After the Southwest became part of the U.S., explorers continued to look for good east–west routes along the 35th parallel. In 1853, a crew led by U.S. Army Lieutenant Amiel Whipple surveyed along a sandy wash in the northern part of the Petrified Forest. So impressed was Whipple by the petrified wood along the banks of the arroyo that he named it Lithodendron Creek (Stone Tree Creek). Geologist Jules Marcou, a member of the Whipple expedition, observed that the petrified trees were from the Triassic.A slightly later route along the parallel was a wagon road, built between 1857 and 1860, that involved experimental use of camels as transport. In the late 19th century, settlers and private stagecoach companies followed similar east–west routes. Homesteaders who stayed in the area developed cattle ranches on the grasslands, and cattle grazed in the Petrified Forest until the mid-20th century.Also close to the 35th parallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the founding of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was then called the Chalcedony Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass through the park every day. U.S. Route 66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in 1985. The park has preserved within its boundaries a small grassy section of the road.

Ai Kago (Jia Hu  Ya Yi , Kago Ai), born February 7, 1988 in Yamatotokada, Nara, Japan, is a Japanese singer, actress, author, and former Guinness World Record holder. Kago began her career at the age of 12 as a member of the idol group Morning Musume. In the same year, she became a founding member of Minimoni. Throughout the second half of 2010, Kago became unhappy with the direction of her work. Around the same time, she began dating restaurant owner Haruhiko Ando, who acted as an in-between for her agency and herself. Since beginning a relationship with Ando, Kago cancelled several jobs at the last minute, causing her agency to suspend her activities. Despite this, she participated in a live performance and opened a separate blog without permission.  Kago parted ways with R&A Promotions in November 2010 despite her contract ending in March 2013. As a response, in 2011, Kazuyuki Ito, president of Mainstream (an associate of R&A Promotions), declared that the agency planned on suing for 100 million yen in damages for contract violations. During that time, Kago's career was also derailed by her personal life. In September 2011, Ando was arrested for alleged extortion and claiming to have connections with the yakuza. In the same month, Kago was rushed to a nearby hospital after agency officials found her on the floor of her apartment with cuts to her wrists. Her life was reported to be not in danger, though there were speculations that it was a planned suicide. Following the incident, she and Ando registered their marriage, and Kago became pregnant.  After spending 2012 out of the public eye with the birth of her daughter, Minami, Kago transferred to a new agency in 2013. Planning to revive her music career, she formed an idol group, which was later named Girls Beat!! The group would be crowd-sourced using lyrics, music, and costume ideas submitted by fans. Remi Kita and Ryona Himeno were recruited as the other two members after passing the auditions.  Girls Beat!! released their first single, \\"Sekai Seifuku\\" on July 22, 2014. Their activities were abruptly put on hold when an arrest warrant was put out for Ando in October on suspicions of loaning money at illegal interest rates. Kago later filed for divorce, planning to continue activities once the divorce was finalized. Although Kago was eventually successful in doing so, in August 2015, her contract with her agency expired, though she continued activities with Girls Beat!! in November.

Before Barbie, all dolls were made to look like babies. People thought that this was a way to teach young girls how to become a good mother. Barbie was the first doll made to look like an adult instead of baby. From the beginning, Barbie was a modern career  girl. There was a different Barbie for each job: nurse, teacher, police officer, race car driver, professional basketball player, pilot, as well as the very first female to fly in space. Barbie made it possible for young girls to dream about a future other than being a mother and a housewife. It showed girls that they had choices and could become anything they wanted to be. At the time, these ideas were very new and positive. The movement for equal opportunity  for women had just begun and women wanted to have the same chance as men to do important work. However, Barbie's approval  as a role model has not lasted. Today, many people criticize  Barbie for making young girls too concerned about their appearance . These people complain that the beautiful, well-dressed Barbie seems to tell girls that while they can hope to have different career, it is more important for them to be beautiful and thin. The female figure that Barbie represents has also been criticized for being unrealistic . Young girls might think that Barbie's figure is beautiful and desirable .

Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 –  7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school.

Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant options A lizard frightening a hiker most likely takes place in an outdoor setting, so we can eliminate options that are not associated with an outdoor environment: - books Step 3: Consider the remaining options Now we have four options left: - garden - trees - rocks - bushes Step 4: Determine the most suitable option We need to think about which of these options is most closely associated with a rustling sound caused by a lizard's movements. Lizards typically move on or between objects in their environment, making it easier to pinpoint the source of the rustling sound. Let's analyze the remaining options: - Garden: This is a broad term and could include trees, rocks, and bushes, but it is not specific enough to identify the source of the rustling sound. - Trees: While lizards can climb trees, the rustling sound wouldn't be easily noticeable by hikers. - Rocks: Lizards often move on or around rocks, but rocks themselves do not usually create a rustling sound when disturbed. - Bushes: This option is a good fit because bushes typically produce a noticeable rustling sound when something, such as a lizard, moves through them.

By most accounts, eReaders such as Amazon's Kindle, Barnes & Noble's Nook, and the Sony Reader will be among the top-selling gifts. Recipients can carry hundreds of books without needing a follow-up visit to a chiropractor. But eReaders can be useful even for people who aren't in a bookish mood. Here are a few tricks many can play: -- Collect recipes. Use your computer to access recipes on the Web and then store them on your eReader with help from a free library management program called Calibre. First you save the recipe page as an html file. Then you use the program to translate it to your eReader's digital format and send it to your device -- either via a USB connection or as an email. You also can use Calibre to round up and format text from newspaper and magazine sites, and blogs, and send them to your eReader. -- Check your calendar. This is easy if your device can access the Internet, as most new models do. Input or synch your appointments to a Web-based service such as Google Calendar, and then access it using the browser in your eReader. While you're at it, you may be able to use the Web connection to check your email, find information on Wikipedia, and interact with sites offering flight schedules, driving directions, and news, sports, and weather. -- Play games. Let others think that you're reading Dostoyevsky while you kill time. Games for the Nook include chess and Sudoku. The Kindle can handle Scrabble, Solitaire, and Texas Hold'em. Sony, though, doesn't offer games on its Reader line. To report corrections and clarifications, contact Standards Editor . For publication consideration in the newspaper, send comments to .

Generate a question about the following movie plot: Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski), a quiet and unassuming man, rents an apartment in Paris whose previous tenant, Egyptologist Simone Choule, attempted to commit suicide by throwing herself out the window and through a pane of glass below. He visits Choule in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Choule's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella (Isabelle Adjani), who has also come to visit. Stella begins talking to Simone, who becomes aware of her visitors. Initially showing some signs of agitation upon seeing them, Choule soon lets out a disturbing cry, then dies. It isn't clear which of the two has caused this reaction. Apparently unaware that Choule is now dead, Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (1973's Enter The Dragon), where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre they part ways. As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised unreasonably by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas), for hosting a party with his friends, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation, but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and the other tenants. He frequently sees his neighbors standing motionless in the toilet room (which he can see from his own window), and discovers a hole in the wall with a human tooth stashed inside. He receives a visit and a letter from one Georges Badar (Rufus), who secretly loves Simone and has believed her to be alive and well. Trelkovsky updates and comforts the man and spends the night out with him. Gradually he changes his breakfast habits to those of Simone, and shifts from Gauloises to Marlboro cigarettes. Trelkovsky becomes severely agitated and enraged when his apartment is robbed, while his neighbors and the concierge (Shelley Winters) continue...

Unloved and neglected by her late parents, who had just been killed in an earthquake, she is a cold, unpleasant girl, unhappy in her new surroundings. Head housekeeper Mrs. Medlock informs Mary she will not be spoiled as she was in India and that her uncle, who spends extended periods of time away from the Manor, will likely not see her. Mary is ordered not to leave her room, but strange noises lead her to explore the mansion on her own. Mrs. Medlock eventually allows her to play outside to keep her from poking about the house.

Answer: Most tires, such as those for automobiles and bicycles, provide traction between the vehicle and the road while providing a flexible cushion that absorbs shock. Question: what are tires made of Answer:","output":"Tires are primarily made of rubber, along with other materials that enhance their performance, durability, and overall structure. The composition of a tire can be divided into five main components: 1. Rubber Compounds: Natural and synthetic rubber are the main components in tires. The rubber compounds are responsible for providing the tire's elasticity, flexibility, and ability to absorb shocks. Typically, a combination of both natural and synthetic rubber is used in various proportions to achieve the desired properties. 2. Reinforcing Agents: Carbon black and silica are added to the rubber compounds to improve the tire's strength, wear resistance, and overall performance. Carbon black serves to reinforce the rubber and enhance its resistance to abrasion, while silica helps reduce rolling resistance, which can result in improved fuel efficiency. 3. Steel belts: Steel belts are layers of steel cords embedded in the rubber layers of the tire. Their primary function is to provide additional strength, puncture resistance, and help maintain the tire's shape. Steel belts can be found in the tread area of radial tires, which is the most common type of tire used for automobiles today. 4. Fabric layers: These are made from synthetic fibers, like polyester, nylon, or rayon, and are responsible for providing reinforcement to the tire's structure and stability. Fabric layers are usually found in the sidewall and lower part of the tread. 5. Chemical additives: Various chemicals are used in the rubber compounds to provide specific properties, such as antioxidants and antiozonants to protect the rubber from deteriorating under environmental stress, and vulcanizing agents like sulfur, which aid in the cross-linking process of the rubber during manufacturing, making it stronger and more durable. In summary, tires are made predominantly from rubber compounds, with additional materials like carbon black, silica, steel belts, and fabric layers for reinforcement, as well as various chemical additives to enhance performance, durability, and resilience."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Article: After years of hearing drivers complain about scratches on their cars, Japan's Nissan Motor Company has officially announced the next big thing---a paint that not only resists scratches and scrapes, but actually repairs itself within a few days. The new material, developed by Nippon Paint Company, contains an elastic rubbery-like resin  that is able to heal minor marks caused by car wash equipment, parking lot encounters, road debris   or even on-purpose destruction. The automaker admits its results vary depending on the temperature and the depth of the damage, but adds this is the only paint like it in the world, and tests prove it works. Minor scratches, the most common type, are said to slowly fade over about a week. And once they're gone, there is no trace that they were ever there. The special paint is said to last for at least three years after it is first applied, but there is no word yet on whether more can be added after that period. Nissan claims car washes are the worst offenders for this type of damage, accounting for at least 80 percent of all incidents. But the complete auto-healing won't come without scratching your wallet. The vehicle maker notes the special paint adds about  100 U.S. to the price of a car. It plans to use its new chemical mixture only on its X - Trail SUVs in Japan for now, as it looks for a more widespread presentation. And while plans to offer the feature overseas haven't been made yet, if it's a hit there, you can be almost sure market forces will drive it to these shores, as well.

The premise you've provided states that if the auditor does not find any additional weaknesses in a company's account or operations, management will receive a good awareness rating, even if updates are required in some controls. The emphasis here is on the existence of weaknesses in a company's system or protocols. If none are found, then by this premise, the management's awareness is good. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that the auditor may choose to give a specific rating based on a perception of the commitment and effort of the management, irrespective of the existence of weaknesses or required strengthening of control measures. This means that an auditor's personal discretion can influence the rating, bucking a strictly objectivity-based evaluation and incorporating a subjectivity-based one into it. The hypothesis makes a claim on the subjective judgment of an auditor, while the premise introduces an objective standard (the absence of additional weaknesses). These two things aren't necessarily contradictory, but they also don't inherently support each other based solely on the information provided.  Thus, it is not possible to conclude definitively that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis also holds true. While it's certainly possible that an auditor could show discretion in line with the hypothesis within the context of the premise, there's not enough information in the premise alone to guarantee that outcome. It's also conceivable that an auditor, despite recognizing good faith effort on part of management, strictly adheres to the objective parameters of the evaluation, making the hypothesis false. Therefore, without making additional assumptions or having more detailed information connecting the premise and hypothesis, it's not possible to definitively say that the truth of the premise ensures the truth of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Paddy wants to leave his neurotic, highly contemptuous wife Elaine (Christine Estabrook) to live with his mistress. Unfortunately Gloria just wants Paddy's money. He hides the money at home. Gloria calls on her two \\"associates\\", Gloria's younger brother Louis (Michael Muhney), and his dim-witted girlfriend Justine (Amber Benson), to rob the Rayne's when the house is empty that night.Elaine figures out the affair and steals Paddy's money from the kitchen cupboard spice bottles. She plans to leave him in the morning. Both cancel their getaway plans to Bakersfield.Later that night, Louis and Justine arrive at the house to rob it, only to be surprised by finding Paddy and Elaine still there, forcing the inept burglars to tie them up. But soon, Louis and Justine realize they cannot leave, for their getaway car is missing (Justine had accidentally left the drive gear on), plus Paddy's other car is gone (their Gunner had taken it for his date with Sally). Soon, the couple is bickering at each other. Louis demands to know where they keep their money. Soon, Julian, the couple's other son, walks in and he too is soon tied up. When Gunner and a drunken Sally return from their late-night date, they are also caught at gunpoint and tied up by the increasingly desperate Louis and Justine.Paddy, in the seclusion of a nearby bathroom, tells Louis that he will give him his wealth totaling 140,000 if he kills his wife so he can be free of her constant nagging, while Elaine later tells Louis that she will give him 15,000 of the store's retail profits if he kills Paddy's mistress, Gloria.

The explosion was at a nuclear power plant in another country called Ukraine. The radiation  caused a lot of damage. It polluted the soil and other things. People lived in the area when the explosion happened. Twenty years later those people are still suffering. Effects from the explosion will go on for a long time. Over two million people still live in the polluted areas. Only 56 people died from the explosion but many other problems have been caused because of it. Some types of cancer are more than 200 times above world average. Many children have cancer now and birth defects  have doubled since the accident. Some people in the United States are worried about the children living there. One group has been trying to raise money. They are called the Chernobyl Children's Project. They want to bring children from the Ukraine to the U.S. each summer. A spokesperson for the group says that radiation is the highest in the summertime, so it is a good time to get the children out of the country. They want to help the children get away for a little while. The Project wants them to be safe from radiation. It costs 1,500 to bring each child to the United States for six weeks. The group raised enough money to bring 28 children to the United States. The children were able to do lots of fun things. They enjoyed clean air, healthy food, and plenty of outdoor fun. One little nine-year-old girl who got to come to the United States said that she likes America. A spokesperson for the Project said that the children that come to America during the summer miss less school when they return home.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Process:  - Your thermostat senses that the room temperature has fallen below your thermostat setting - Your thermostat sends a signal to your heating system to provide heat for your home - When your oil burner is engaged, heating oil travels from the tank to the burner by way of a pump - Here the oil becomes a fine mist mixed with air - The fuel/air mixture is then injected into the burner where it is ignited in the combustion chamber - The warm air is disbursed through vents, hot water through baseboards, or by steam radiators -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"The home isnt insulated well\\" happens, how will it affect more of the fuel air mixture is injected into the burner.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis, \\"The home isn't insulated well,\\" can indirectly affect the process. Insulation plays an essential role in maintaining the temperature of a home. If the home's insulation is inadequate, the heat generated by the heating system will be lost faster than it can be replaced, causing the room temperature to fall more rapidly. As a result, the thermostat will sense the room temperature falling below the thermostat setting more frequently, causing it to continuously send signals to the heating system to provide additional heat. This, in turn, will lead to the oil burner being engaged more often, resulting in more frequent instances of heating oil traveling from the tank to the burner and being transformed into a fine mist mixed with air. The increased engagement of the oil burner, due to poor insulation, will lead to more fuel/air mixture being injected into the burner over time. This will likely result in higher fuel consumption and increased energy costs for the homeowner. The perturbation has an indirect effect on the process as it doesn't impact the stages of the process directly but influences the frequency at which they occur."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Charles Darwin's book The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms (1881) presented the first scientific analysis of earthworms' contributions to soil fertility. Some burrow while others live entirely on the surface, generally in moist leaf litter. The burrowers loosen the soil so that oxygen and water can penetrate it, and both surface and burrowing worms help to produce soil by mixing organic and mineral matter, by accelerating the decomposition of organic matter and thus making it more quickly available to other organisms, and by concentrating minerals and converting them to forms that plants can use more easily. Earthworms are also important prey for birds ranging in size from robins to storks, and for mammals ranging from shrews to badgers, and in some cases conserving earthworms may be essential for conserving endangered birds. What was the first scientific study of how earthworms help soil?","output":"The first scientific study of how earthworms help soil was conducted by Charles Darwin, a renowned naturalist and biologist. His book, titled \\"The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms\\" (1881), presented the pioneering scientific analysis of earthworms' contributions to soil fertility. In this groundbreaking work, Darwin explored the behavior of various types of earthworms, distinguishing between burrowers and surface dwellers, and their impact on soil characteristics and overall ecosystem health. Darwin observed that burrowing earthworms played a crucial role in loosening the soil, thereby improving its aeration and allowing water to penetrate more effectively. This, in turn, facilitated the growth of various plant species, ensuring the long-term productivity of the ecosystem. He also noted that both surface-dwelling and burrowing worms were instrumental in producing soil by promoting the mixing of organic and mineral matter. Earthworms help accelerate the decomposition of organic materials, making them more accessible to other organisms while also concentrating minerals and converting them into forms that plants can absorb and utilize. Through his meticulous observations, Darwin was able to shed light on the essential ecological functions performed by earthworms. These creatures are not only crucial to maintaining healthy and fertile soil conditions, but they also serve as a key food source for a diverse range of birds and mammals. Consequently, the conservation of earthworm populations holds significant importance for the preservation of endangered bird species and overall biodiversity. In summary, Charles Darwin's \\"The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms\\" (1881) was the first scientific study to examine the ways in which earthworms contribute to soil fertility. By highlighting the ecological importance of these organisms, Darwin laid the foundation for understanding the integral role earthworms play in sustaining healthy ecosystems and promoting soil fertility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
