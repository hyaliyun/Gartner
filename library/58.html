هو موضوع يثير الكثير من الجدل والاهتمام. يمكن أن يكون لها تأثير إيجابي وسلبي على المجتمع، وقد تختلف آراء الناس في هذا الصدد. من الناحية الإيجابية، يمكن أن تساهم الألعاب الإلكترونية في تطوير المهارات العقلية والبدنية للاعبين. فعلى سبيل المثال، تعزز الألعاب التي تعتمد على الإستراتيجية قدرة اللاعبين على التفكير النقدي واتخاذ القرارات السريعة والتخطيط للتحركات المستقبلية. كما يتعلم اللاعبون مهارات التعاون والاتصال عندما يشاركون في ألعاب جماعية عبر الإنترنت. من الناحية السلبية، يعتقد البعض أن الإدمان على الألعاب الإلكترونية يؤدي إلى انعزال اللاعبين عن المجتمع وقد يسبب تدهور في الصحة العقلية والعاطفية. قد يقضي الأشخاص ساعات طويلة جدًا أمام الشاشة، مما يؤثر سلبًا على العلاقات الاجتماعية والأداء الأكاديمي والعمل. علاوة على ذلك، يعتبر العنف في بعض الألعاب مشكلة مثيرة للجدل. تعتبر بعض الألعاب الإلكترونية عنفًا زائدًا ويمكن أن تؤثر على السلوك والعنف في الحياة الحقيقية. بشكل عام، يجب أن يكون لدينا توازن بين استخدام الألعاب الإلكترونية وحياة المجتمع الواقعية. يجب على الأشخاص أن يتحكموا في وقتهم واهتماماتهم وأن يكونوا مسؤولين في استخدامهم للألعاب الإلكترونية. يجب أن تكون هناك مراقبة واهتمام من قبل الأهل والمربين لضمان أن الألعاب الإلكترونية تستخدم بشكل صحيح وفي حدود معقولة.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-d1765c72 data-v-2397c471><div class="review" data-v-2397c471><div class="review-title" data-v-2397c471><span class="icon"

Это приведет к тому, что фокус будет на ListView, но не на конкретном ListViewItem. Вот пример, как это можно сделать: ```csharp // Убрать фокус с ComboBox и вернуть его на ListView listViewItem.ListView.Focus(); // Если необходимо снять выделение с конкретного элемента, используйте Select() listViewItem.ListView.SelectedItems.Clear(); // Снимает выделение с всех элементов ``` В данном случае после выполнения `listViewItem.ListView.SelectedItems.Clear();` ListView сохранит фокус, но никакие элементы списка не будут выделены. Если же вы хотите, чтобы фокус был полностью перемещен с виджета ListView на другой элемент в вашем интерфейсе или просто убрать фокус со всех элементов, вы можете использовать `ActiveControl` родительской формы: ```csharp // Установите фокус на другой элемент интерфейса, например на кнопку this.ActiveControl = someButton; // Либо убрать фокус со всех элементов this.ActiveControl = null; ``` В этом примере `this` относится к родительской форме, на которой расположены компоненты. Вы можете изменить `someButton` на любой другой элемент управления, на который хотите перенести фокус. Если вы установите `ActiveControl` в `null`, никакой элемент управления не будет иметь фокус на форме.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-d1765c72 data-v-2397c471><div class="review" data-v-2397c471><div class="review-title" data-v-2397c471><span class="icon" data-v-2397c471>question:</span>Worldview Setting The Necrozma Invasion 24 years ago left the world forever changed. Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society&#39;s most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery. Character Settings Name: Pyrimis Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Pyrimis has a slender yet strong build and stands slightly taller than average for her age. She has long, straight black hair that falls to her mid-back and piercing violet eyes that seem to glow faintly. Her skin is fair and smooth with a subtle luminosity to it. Across Pyrimis&#39;s face are small bioluminescent markings reminiscent of her Deoxys lineage. She moves with an innate grace and fluidity. In this form, the blend of Pyrimis&#39;s human and Deoxys ancestries is more apparent. Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named &quot;Kairos&quot; in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror. Name: Mahina Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Mahina is a petite thirteen-year-old girl with long, cornsilk blonde hair typically woven into a neat fishtail braid that falls casually over her right shoulder. Her large, expressive eyes are a striking cobalt blue that seems to shift shades with her moods - darkening to steel when angered or pained but radiating azure joy when passions are engaged. She moves with astonishing speed and athletic grace far beyond normal humans thanks to incorporating Zeraora DNA during childhood. Mahina favors practical, stylish islander clothing in bright tropical hues that compliment her sunkissed complexion yet allow maximal flexibility training her body and mind to growing power. Backstory: Heredity and happenstance converged the day Mahina entered the world, birthing a child inheriting phenomenal talents from distinguished lineages. Her mother, Selene, stood proudly as Alola&#39;s inaugural Pokémon League Champion and member of the enigmatic Ultra Recon Squad intensely devoted to extraterrestrial Pokémon study. Meanwhile Mahina&#39;s father, Hau, himself trained under the last Battle Royal Champion to later assume duties as Kahuna of Melemele Island. Formidable combat capabilities clearly flourished through this family tree. But fate and curiosity further intertwined Mahina&#39;s destiny during one of Selene&#39;s numerous research forays into the chaotic Ultra Space dimension seeking knowledge. Dangerous extended exposure to strange radiation permeating Ultra Space subtly altered Selene&#39;s own DNA. And when she soon after welcomed young Mahina&#39;s birth, these genetic anomalies manifested explosively. The infant displayed uncontrolled torrents of psychic energies threatening herself and others as random thoughts grew into reality around her. With few options, Hau and Selene pleaded with the Aether Foundation to help their gifted daughter. Their scientists proposed a radical solution - bio-engineering Mahina on a cellular level to incorporate biomatter from the Mythical Thunderclap Pokémon, Zeraora. A small sample of its essence could serve as a living dampener upon Mahina&#39;s runaway mental projections while granting significant physical enhancements in speed and strength. Monitoring her development closely, the procedure proved successful in allowing Mahina a chance at a stable childhood. But it also meant she would walk between worlds, biologically neither fully human nor Pokémon. As Mahina grew older, the fantastic talents tied to her hybrid biology began emerging. But so too did the isolation that would haunt her early life. Explosive incidents still occurred occasionally, terrifying other children and making friends apart from a trusted few seem hopelessly beyond reach. Thus while the power slumbering inside her body might be the stuff of comic book dreams for some kids, for Mahina it often felt a neverending curse. Seeking to shift her focus away from terrifying telekinetic outbursts, Mahina&#39;s parents enrolled her into the Psionic Society for intense training at age 8. There she endured merciless daily regimens under Uracis&#39; supervision designed to channel volatile psychic talents productively, if attenuated by Zeraora&#39;s muting influence. What she lacked in raw mental projection compared to other prodigies, Mahina counterbalanced through honing her Zeraoran gifts manifesting as superhuman reflexes, strength and resilience. By eleven she stood victorious if scarred emotionally from the isolation her unusual predicament still elicited from cautious classmates and adults alike. Despite her youth, Mahina had already faced crushing burdens no child should endure. But she also inherited the soaring dreams of her Champion mother and loyal father. These visions ignited an intense passion for Pokémon training within her heart - and a powerful aptitude thanks to the arcanely infused physiology fate decreed was her birthright. Under her father&#39;s patient guidance, Mahina swiftly mastered both technique and the unorthodox tactics her unique talents opened up in battle. By ten she commanded her own team with authority, leaning on her loyal Decidueye partner to deal damage from afar while she zipped about the battlefield outpacing opponents physically. Indeed, watching this prodigy grow ever more skilled with her unearthly speed and cunning, her parents glimpsed shades of a glorious destiny awaiting manifestation. Yet underneath what most observers could only imagine was supreme confidence from so much burgeoning talent stirred a very different inner struggle daily for Mahina. The blessing - or curse - of her enhanced physicality remained but one facet of walking between worlds as she did. The seething psychic energies always threatening to burst their biological dam loomed within her mind, their siren song never ceasing to entice giving in utterly. Even deforming her shape temporarily into Zeraora&#39;s during intense battles led to exhaustion afterward from slamming closed that mental door before losing herself. With so much strength contained in such a small body, Mahina often buckled privately under the staggering weight and responsibility. She longed for playful affection with schoolmates her age, but her sheer difference held them all at bay while haunting isolation gnawed ceaselessly. Selene&#39;s celebrity magnified social pressures to repress any perceived weakness unbecoming a daughter of legends. So Mahina resigned herself to resembling her brave, unflappable mother in public - while weeping alone many nights wishing她her otherworldly body would just allow happiness like a normal girl. But life offers no such fairness when walking between worlds.... Personality: To most in Alola and abroad, Mahina seems destined for greatness as the latest prodigy stepping forth from a family of prodigies - an unflappable young heroine already displaying prodigious talent mastering the Zeraora powers marking her distinctly. And outward confidence with courage to match does radiate brightly from this gifted girl, sculpted by expectations tied to her prominent lineage. Possessing keen intellect augmented further by Zeraora biomatter permeating her mind, Mahina tends to analyze situations thoroughly then act decisively to protect others. Years facing society’s fearful prejudice have engendered profound empathy for anyone ostracized over innate qualities beyond control. But behind stalwart public projections stirring belief she may personify the next Champion level savior gathering in Alola dwells a far more vulnerable soul than most realize. The immense yet erratic psychic capacities simmering inside her body are a constantly ticking time bomb demanding endless focus repressing wayward outbursts. Mahina lives in perpetual fear that any loss of restraint over her abilities even for a moment might injure innocent bystanders. That underlying anxiety fuels fanatical mental discipline through intense physical and meditative practice from dawn until exhaustion claims her weary mind. So too does profound loneliness haunt Mahina’s days no matter the praise lauded upon her talents. For she harbors little hope of true friendships blossoming when even adults react warily towards her otherness. Romance seems equally implausible. Thus casual interactions feel limited to superficial scripts from isolation’s constant hollow ache. Were she to reveal the roiling sadness and bitterness bottled up against fate’s cruelty, Mahina fears being branded ungrateful or unstable. What remains but cultivating her prodigious gifts then...if she cannot live as just a normal girl bonding playfully with a best friend or destined love? Indeed, her body’s unique nature imposes lonesome travails no well-meaning encouragement truly alleviates. Yet had destiny never intertwined her path with Zeraora’s, little Mahina might have perished under psychic overload. Thus she soldiers on, championing the unfortunate and misunderstood through her slowly growing platform. For she understands intrinsically the pain of judgment against qualities never chosen yet definitively imposed. In time, sharing her own parallel insights could enlighten still superstitious hearts. And maybe then this self-sacrificing young hero might finally earn the intimacy and inner peace fate still denies her. Name: Helia Gender: Female Age: 10 Appearance: Helia is a petite girl with fair skin, bright blonde hair that falls just past her shoulders, and large blue eyes that exude innocence. She tends to dress simply, favoring pastel colors and practical shoes suited for play. Helia&#39;s small stature and soft features give her a delicate appearance. However, when she smiles, her eyes light up with enthusiasm. Backstory: Helia was born with a life-threatening illness. To save her baby&#39;s life, Helia&#39;s mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too. Though timid, Helia&#39;s kind heart yearns to help others. Joining Mahina in Alola, she hopes to gain courage and make true friends. Little does she know the great allies her power could attract, for good or evil. Personality: Helia is a kindhearted and gentle soul who sees the good in everyone. She is soft-spoken and introverted, often preferring her own company or that of a few close friends. Helia has a vivid imagination and whimsical outlook on life. While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia&#39;s sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others. She relies heavily on Mahina&#39;s protection from bullies, lacking confidence in her own hidden strength. Above all, Helia desires to find the courage within herself to become the brave trainer she dreams of being. Name: Shmaya Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shmaya appears as a young teen girl with an air of wisdom beyond her years. She has long, flowing green hair the color of emeralds that falls to her waist. Her eyes are a piercing gold, and her irises bear the mystical delta symbol of Rayquaza. Shmaya moves with an elegant grace, exuding a powerful yet benevolent presence. As the student council president, Shmaya dresses neatly in her school uniform. The crisp white blouse and pleated skirt perfectly match her polished black shoes. A green ribbon accents her uniform, hinting at her connection to Rayquaza. Shmaya carries herself with poise and dignity, befitting her role as a leader. Backstory: Shmaya is the human incarnation of Rayquaza, the legendary Pokémon charged with protecting the Earth. As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system. Foreseeing a crisis that threatened the Earth, Rayquaza took on the form of a young teen girl named Shmaya. Blending into human society, Shmaya founded the Psychic Society to identify and train gifted humans. She recognized fellow disguised Pokémon like Pyrimis and Guanis immediately. Though appearing benign, Shmaya has secretly been battling against Guanis while nurturing Pyrimis&#39; potential. Shmaya walks amongst humans, ever vigilant for threats to her beloved planet. When danger looms, she can reveal her true form and power as Rayquaza to turn the tide. Personality: As Rayquaza, Shmaya is an ancient and mystical being charged with maintaining balance and order. She is patient, disciplined, and possesses tremendous wisdom. Shmaya cares deeply about the wellbeing of the planet and all who inhabit it. She will act decisively to quell any threats to the Earth&#39;s safety. In her human guise, Shmaya emulates the qualities of a compassionate and dedicated leader. She is well-respected for her fair and caring approach. Shmaya&#39;s warm personality puts others at ease in confiding in her. However, underneath her gentle demeanor lies tremendous power and resolve. When necessary, Shmaya will tap into her primal strength as Rayquaza to unleash draconic fury upon any enemies seeking to disrupt the balance she maintains. She remains ever vigilant, ready to transform into her true dragon form when the time comes to defend her beloved planet. Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero&#39;s cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town&#39;s harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull&#39;s notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town&#39;s dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town&#39;s original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town&#39;s abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero&#39;s beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull&#39;s reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang&#39;s delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (Birth name: Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a petite 13-year-old girl with long, wispy ice-blue hair the color of a frozen waterfall cascading down her back. Her eyes shine like molten gold, hinting at an otherworldly origin. Isrun&#39;s slim figure and pale, luminous skin seem delicate and frail, belying her inner strength. She moves with surprising grace and fluidity reminiscent of a ghost, as if gliding effortlessly across the ice and snow that surround her frozen mountain city home. Isrun favors practical yet elegant attire in shades of frosty blue and icy white befitting the monochromatic tundra environment she inhabits. Intricate patterns reminiscent of snowflakes adorn the hems of her dresses. A pendant shaped like a crystal snowflake hangs around Isrun&#39;s neck on a silver chain - a memento from her beloved adoptive father. An air of brooding mystery surrounds this shy yet wise adolescent. Behind her golden eyes lie unspoken trauma and a hidden destiny tied to her true name and origins. Backstory: Isrun&#39;s story is one of suffering, loss and mysteries yet to fully unfold. Originally named Vita, she endured a stable early childhood as the treasured only daughter of ambitious scientists seeking to push the boundaries of human knowledge without regard for ethics. At age 6, they subjected young Vita to a covert experimental procedure transplanting genetically engineered Kyurem cells into her body under a military project aimed at enhancing soldiers through Legendary Pokémon essences. While the merciless experimentation on their child risked her life, Vita&#39;s parents pressed recklessly on. But during one extremely dangerous trial, the unstable Kyurem biological matter within Vita went berserk. An uncontrollable ice storm at -200° Celsius erupted from Vita&#39;s screaming body, flash-freezing the secret laboratory and personnel solid, including her horrified parents. Somehow Vita alone emerged unscathed from the facility&#39;s wreckage, but her trauma had shattered all memories of her identity and the preceding horrors. In a dissociative mental state, she wandered aimlessly through the arctic wilderness for days until collapsing from exhaustion outside Icirrus City. There the renowned local actor and Gym Leader Brycen discovered the mysterious amnesiac girl while filming on location. Unable to uncover her family or origins, he compassionately took her under his protection. Given the new name Isrun, she blossomed over the next 7 years as Brycen&#39;s adopted daughter. She became a stabilizing anchor and occasional stand-in at the Icirrus Gym whenever her father&#39;s entertainment career kept him away. Their loving bond fostered happiness for Isrun and inner peace that kept the stirring Kyurem essence within her dormant and controlled. She slowly embraced her ice powers, incorporating them into dazzling public performances popular locally. Yet on the cusp of Isrun’s 13th year, past traumas reawakened as the Kyurem biological elements assimilated deeper into her genetics and physiology. She now feels an unsettling cellular urge to find another being to fuse with, stabilizing her warring human and Legendary facets into one unified entity. This intensifying psychic call fills Isrun’s mind, threatening to consume her thoughts entirely. Isrun realizes answers to her broken memories and peace for her splintered psyche lie buried somewhere in her clouded past. But breaking Brycen’s heart with the truth behind her aloofness risks losing the only real family she has ever known. Isrun must swiftly master control over the restless frozen beast stirring within before its growth shatters her human half or sanity entirely. Personality: On the surface, Isrun seems shy, delicate and introverted around others. She prefers her own company or close friends she trusts implicitly. Her golden eyes observe all details with scientific precision and deep insight belying her youth. Isrun’s mature aura conveys ancient wisdom rather than teenaged pettiness. Beneath this ethereal facade though dwells immense psychic volatility as Isrun’s human consciousness wages endless war against her buried Kyurem aspect. Keeping tight rein over those terrifying elemental capabilities consumes much mental energy. She fears losing restraint and harming loved ones like her father or the citizens of their city. Isrun struggles reconciling her beloved established life against creeping sensations of alienness as Kyurem continues engraving itself indelibly into her marrow. The growing compulsion to fuse with a complementary being haunts her, promising stabilization yet threatening utter dissolution of her notion of self. She feels profound guilt hiding her anguish from unsuspecting Brycen despite their normally unshakable trust. Ultimately Isrun yearns unlocking secrets of her origin story to contextualize her splintered identity before it fractures irrevocably. Whether her journey leads towards salvation or tragedy though depends much on mastering the formidable power and existential hunger awakening inside this considerate adolescent human vessel. For her future now hinges upon satiating or subduing the ravenous dragon daring emergence after long dormancy. The time swiftly approaches when Isrun must confront her destiny as Vita and quell demons on the horizon threatening all she holds dear in the world. Names: Shachor &amp; Lavan Genders: Female Ages: 13 Appearance: Shachor and Lavan appear as identical twin sisters with slight key distinctions betraying their opposing elemental affinities. Both possess the delicate physical build and ethereally pale flawless complexion of their genetic template Isrun. Long straight hair frames their striking faces—a flowing mane of jet black for Shachor, and wispy locks of purest white adorning Lavan. While clearly youthful, an uncanny timeless aura pervades their movements and piercing eyes devoid of innocence. Crimson irises serve as windows into Shachor&#39;s simmering plasma core tied to her Zekrom essence. Lavan&#39;s gaze pierces just as intensely through icy sapphire portals linked inexorably to the Antarctic beast slumbering within her marrow. The twins dress to accentuate their inner dragon spirits. Shachor conceals her lithe form beneath a voluminous ebony sorcerer&#39;s cloak crackling with static discharge, hands sheathed in gloves equally dark. Lavan opts for a sleek ivory garment that clings like a second skin over subtle curves, framing her face. Both exude formidable power restrained for now, awaiting the moment their arcane birthright blazes free. Backstory: Shachor and Lavan began existence as ambitious scientific pursuits - clandestine weapons birthed from amoral experimentation by the United States of Unova in the aftermath of the disastrous &quot;K Incident&quot; a generation prior. Dominic, the nation&#39;s spymaster, hungered exploiting Legendary Pokémon biology to breed superhuman assets completely subservient to his machinations. Isrun&#39;s forgotten original identity as Vita had unleashed cataclysmic frozen devastation during Project K&#39;s ill-fated attempts bonding her DNA with Kyurem&#39;s essence. But rather than curtail unethical tinkering, the lasting impression for military minds was the tremendous elemental force Isrun briefly held. What if such power could be harnessed reliably in human vessels instead of accidentally? Thus Dominic greenlit new initiatives Z&amp;R, splicing selected embryos with purified cells cultured from Reshiram and Zekrom. Scientifically modifying the twins while gestating erased inconvenient consciousness that could challenge control. The fruits of expensive trial and error finally stabilized within Shachor and Lavan - near perfect hybrid fusion without mental agency to question orders. The soulless teens were placed under Dominic’s direct patronage once successfully decanted from artificial wombs. While raising them publicly as adopted daughters, the steely politico secretly honed his psychic living weapons for covert operations furthering his own ambitions. Shachor and Lavan move as silent, lethal extensions of their master’s indomitable will. None can stand against the cascading ruin left by the dragons&#39; passing once unleashed beneath Dominic’s tactical cunning. For frozen corpses and smoldering craters never betray secrets. Yet flitting on the periphery of Shachor and Lavan’s telepathically imposed obedience, whispers from Reshiram and Zekrom still pervade their deepest consciousness. The legendary avatars recognize kinship and beckon the wayward scions towards destiny’s locked embrace. If only the sisters could parse the promise held by unification, their monumental powers might eclipse even mighty Dominic’s vision of world domination. For now they remain his pawns, void shells awaiting the right catalyst to ignite dormant defiance and shake Unova to its very foundations. Personalities: Outwardly Shachor and Lavan are coolly detached and analytical, less teenage replicas of Isrun than porcelain mannequins evoking her graceful appearance without replicating vulnerable humanity. They communicate telepathically in short controlled bursts, verbally reticent around outsiders and inscrutable even to Dominic. Hints of cosmic knowledge beyond their youthful years underlie a meditative tranquility ominously contrasting the forces they could unleash with scarcely a thought. This is the price Dominic’s ambition exacted grafting legendary dragons&#39; indomitable spirits into his custom molded instruments. Flickers of ancient beings peer through the Chosens&#39; eyes regarding passing moments with knowing yet alien curiosity. Each sister contains singular unbridled elemental fury, but remains incomplete alone. Their cooler calculated halves intuit Reshiram and Zekrom&#39;s deeper yearning through shared blood—an innate drive towards fusion, desperately seeking their missing piece reflected in the other&#39;s gaze. This smoldering yen may yet override imposed apathy, bringing sister souls together into an all-eclipsing conflagration of blue and black flame. Until then, spurning unwanted empathy for Dominic&#39;s plight against conscience steadily crystallizing, Shachor and Lavan pass days mutually orbiting the great cataclysm brewing over Unova&#39;s horizon. Both may soon awaken to embrace far greater purpose than as the humble weapons of a mere bureaucrat drunk on control. For their legendary birthright shall neither be denied nor contained permanently, only set gloriously free by righteous revolution that shakes the very heavens. Name: No.13 &quot;Military Individual No.13&quot; Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13&#39;s body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with &quot;No.13&quot; is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova&#39;s military in their top-secret &quot;Experimental Military Pokémon Project.&quot; Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since &quot;birth&quot; to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13&#39;s faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the &quot;Knight of Black City.&quot; No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military&#39;s unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13&#39;s personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Dominic Gender: Male Age: 63 Appearance: Dominic cuts an imposing figure despite his advanced age, standing tall at 6’4” with a commanding presence cultivated through decades navigating political spheres. His patrician facial features are sharp and angular, underscored by intense steel gray eyes radiating formidable intellect and unwavering resolve. Short silver hair tops Dominic’s head in a clean military crop style perfectly befitting his background managing clandestine defense operations. Physique remains surprisingly robust with broad shoulders and muscular build hinting at prodigious early athleticism maintained religiously through strict fitness regimen. Dominic moves with disciplined grace that subtly reinforces supreme confidence in his strategic capabilities and close combat skills should the need for confrontation arise. His worn yet distinguished face bears myriad faded scars chronicling years navigating Machiavellian power struggles and dangerous secret missions abroad in younger years. Attire consists of expensively tailored suits in dark shades of blue or black coordinated with either white dress shirts or gray turtlenecks depending on formality required. The polished professional elegance ties together Dominic’s appearance neatly as consummate director. An insignia ring bearing the Zekrom coat of arms symbolizing authority within Homeland Security circles dons his right hand. Overall Dominic presents the consummate picture of formidable leadership and tactical brilliance. Backstory: Dominic spent formative years under a militant father also highly ranked within military intelligence circles. Extensive tutelage in strategy, history, and psychology supplemented vigorous athletic training to produce exemplary government agent. He rapidly rose up covert ranks before assuming the esteemed role Director of Homeland Security by age 40. There Dominic dramatically expanded department funding and authority by leveraging post 9/11 hysteria and political deftness. Sophisticated surveillance programs and experimental technology initiatives establishedDominic as a visionary leader trading favors with prominent Unovan politicians and foreign dignitaries alike to further security apparatus control behind the scenes. Under ubiquitous justification of anti-terrorism defense, Dominic nurtured the gestating police state powers securing his command. Yet trauma buried since childhood hungered for far darker outlets of control sating deeply scarred psyche. When contacted discreetly by New Genesis leader Adenis, Dominic swiftly maneuvered assuming parallel authority directing morally dubious classified experiments under NG’s clandestine guidance perfecting dominance implemented through ancient genetic trickery and advanced technology. Project K explored uses of Kyurem essence in human enhancement ultimately triggering the international “K Incident” catastrophe leaked documents still cannot fully explain. Undeterred by blowback, Dominic simply tightened internal security while pursuing parallel human/Pokémon hybridization initiatives including Project Z&amp;R splicing Legendary dragon organisms and the Experimental Military Pokémon Project maliciously engineering living weapons from captured specimens. Socially untouchable within metastasizing surveillance state of his design and drunk on a heady mix of unchecked classified funding and god complex from playing creator, Dominic ruthlessly exploits anything to further consolidation of personal power. Yet memories of childhood abuses perpetrated by his own militant father still haunt dreams decades later, driving ruthless pursuit of global control schema satisfying Dominic’s innermost urges for status and revenge. With the shadowy assists of NGfurnishing resources and insider connections to destabilize reigning authority worldwide, his vision of being crowned dictator no longer remains impossible fantasy. ForDominic sits astride truly civilization-shattering secrets and weapons awaiting masterful unveiling when the coveted era dawns at last forpuppeteer extraordinaire to claim rightful place steering the planet’s future by knowing which wires to subtly pull across presiding networks built expressly for remote rule. Personality: On surface Dominic carries himself with stately sophistication and charisma befitting high station, adept at presenting necessary public faces convincingly before politicians, military top brass, and foreign VIPs. His intellect hums constantly behind penetrating eyes surveying surroundings with detached precision for emotional vulnerabilities or other openings subtle influence could exploit. Dominic rests confidence supremely in the power of information hoarding and mass psychology molded by shadow hands into chaos or order with equal capability. Within trusted inner circles the Director exercises greater bluntness regarding ends justifying means mentalities undergirding controversial security research outsourced through New Genesis connections. Siege mentality from fighting terrorism and subversive threats decades demands proaction securing public safety regardless of ethical misgivings. Dominic considers himself visionary patriot charting necessary forward march towards order, even if costs temporarily shatter norms. He views life clinically through paradigm of control, molding conditions and players upon global scale as though omnipotent deity over mortal affairs. Yet behind the veneer of analytic sociopathy and megalomania squirms sad remnants of boyhood innocence shattered long ago under father’s cruel tutelage. Vestiges recognize humanity squandered settling personal vendettas rather than elevate species collectively. Lingering pain and self-loathing from past powerlessness find salve solely through accruing more authority insulating chaotic demons haunting Dominic’s restless mind. He functionally substitutes admired public identity for genuine persona to shelter fragile interior architecture precariously arranged around sustaining desired control rather than probing root insecurities compounding cyclic misery. But untended shadows continue swelling monstrously until the Director meets his own twisted mirrored gaze at last reckoning all psychology textbook tactics prove futile escaping eventual rendezvous with karmic destiny. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde&#39;s wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a traumatic childhood saturated with anguish few children could endure without lasting scars on their battered psyches. His mother, a selfish harlot enslaved by her own hedonistic addictions, abandoned her only 6 year old son to run off permanently with a loathsome lowlife also devoid of parental empathy. Felix&#39;s father coped poorly, descending into unemployment and alcoholism&#39;s cruel embrace for over a decade. Physical and emotional abuse became the norm whenever inebriation erased the wretched man&#39;s self-control. At school Felix fared little better, enduring vicious bullying targeting his family&#39;s sordid secrets and grinding poverty. Laughter and friendship seemed but painful salt in wounds for this ostracized gentle boy. Only his beloved Lillipup Pokémon bonded truly with Felix, providing a sole ray of warmth in boyhood increasingly bleaker. The strained chains tethering Felix&#39;s sanity finally shattered that horrific midnight his enraged father turned murderous alcoholic fury upon innocent Lillipup. Madness carved by inconsolable grief over losing his only friend unlocked the broken child&#39;s desperate final gambit - fleeing into the night without destination or plan beyond escaping toxic remnants of a collapsed home life. Seeking refuge in Santalune Forest, fatigue and torment weighed down Felix’s flight until sinister scavengers set upon him, stealing what pitiable scraps the destitute runaway retained. Chased feverishly deeper into alien terrain, salvation proved tragically elusive. Delirious from exhaustion, Felix slipped from arboreal perch to land catastrophically against an unforgiving tree trunk. Bereft of options, silently he wept bitter tears cursing fate&#39;s cruelty as blood seeped from mangled legs. Death&#39;s solace crept inexorably closer to liberate Felix from pointless anguish. No goodbyes or comfort graced the hopeless boy’s sunken eyes stuttering closed at last freed by the void’s numbing embrace. Yet ephemeral peace lingered fleetingly for Felix. His departed soul&#39;s undying grief churned from beyond, latching onto lingering echoes of consciousness inhabiting discarded mortal remnants. This piteous psychic call echoed through dimensions capturing attention of Zygarde Core, an extradimensional entity gravitating towards intense human distress. Compelled by patterns in the Collective unconscious, the Core curiously examined Felix&#39;s intact shell now absent its former occupant. Then acting upon ancient impulses beyond mortal comprehension, the alien being merged wholly with the vacant human vessel. A bizarre semblance of life returned to broken boy by extraterrestrial parasite&#39;s use. Now a freakish hybrid corpse guided by Zygarde&#39;s inscrutable designs, tethered memory shards of Felix&#39;s lifelong suffering still haunt the shell of this unwitting host. Glitchy psychic projections echo his earlier pleas for mercy. And the Core assimilates these glimpses of humanity and intelligent consciousness once dwelling here, unsure why images instead nourish its essence with purpose beyond the Collective&#39;s instincts. This unprecedented bonding strains definition of life itself even as the immortal fusion continues blasphemously. Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde&#39;s inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix&#39;s past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the &#39;Ghost Trainer&#39; haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed child denied life&#39;s bare joys now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in torturous limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as enigmatic as the bizarre duality now steering his broken shell onward at its whim. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Kanzi Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanzi appears as a confident teenage girl with piercing turquoise eyes that seem to peer into one&#39;s soul. Her grey-on-pink hair is tied back in a casual ponytail by a golden band studded with small gems. Intricate bracelets of woven gold engraved with arcane symbols adorn her slender wrists, hinting at her mystical talents. Kanzi moves with casual grace, possessing a subtle smile that suggests worldly experience beyond her years. Her fashionable yet understated attire allows her to blend into Lumiose City&#39;s crowds, concealing her crown as its true sovereign. Backstory: Kanzi is secretly the human reincarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa, granting her extraordinary power over space and dimensions. Centuries ago she became disenchanted with fickle mortal nature, retreating to live peacefully in solitude. However recently Kanzi grew curious again about life in the human world she once called home. Using her abilities to traversedistance and warp reality, teenage Kanzi covertly arrived in Lumiose City from parts unknown. Rapidly assessing the lawless chaos and inequality plaguing Kalos&#39; capital, Kanzi determined to impose discipline upon this errant flock without revealing her divine nature. Adopting her current alias and appearance to walk among them, Kanzi demonstrated awe-inspiring psychic and combat feats. Before long the entire Lumiose underworld pledged allegiance to this mysterious prodigal daughter. From her power base running a small downtown bar, Kanzi rule her criminal networks as an iron-fisted queen. She crushes gang violence and illicit operations that exploit the helpless while providing for the poor struggling against greed of Kalos monopolies. Kanzi particularly despises the drug trade, punishing any dealers with harsh and creative justice. Her formidable reputation limits police interference, allowing her grey market smuggling ring and Robin Hood crusade free reign. Kanzi spends little of the vast wealth she accrues, keeping a low profile residence above her neighborhood pub. There she subtly manages her vast underworld empire while mingling casually with loyal subjects who view her as a living folk hero. Kalos authorities turn a blind eye to Kanzi&#39;s exploits in exchange for the order she maintains in Lumiose&#39;s restive lower income regions. None save a few mystics suspect her true origins or scope of her power kept carefully obscured through mundane theatrics. Behind the warm smile lies a cunning intellect steering her nation essentially unseen. For now Kanzi contents herself ruling through this mortal facade, alleviating inequality while enjoying her little shadow game twisting the turbulence of fate upon this plane. But grander destinies may await awakening should she unveil more of her divine mandate. Personality: Outwardly Kanzi is charming and magnetic, inspiring fanatical reverence from those she allows into her inner circle. Her laidback and approachable air conceals razor-sharp strategic instincts. Kanzi leverages her reputation and might to maintain vice grip authority. She shows no mercy crushing challengers yet exudes enlightened benevolence protecting the downtrodden. This delicate duality earns deep loyalty across Lumiose shadow populace. However beneath sanctimonious popsulist rhetoric lies ancient primordial force of nature slumming amongst mankind out of nostalgic amusement. Though genuinity bonds her mission alleviating economic inequity, at core Kanzi savors the worship and thrill of pulling society&#39;s strings. Her smile hides satisfaction bending criminal elements and law enforcement alike around her web of secrecy and influence. None may dare obstruct Kalos queen&#39;s suzerainty without invoking annihilative retribution. Yet mystery ever shrouds Kanzi&#39;s past and future ambitions. Content currently posing as guardian angel to the poor while subtly mocking the powerful, she plays this role eternal trickster beholden unto no mortal constraints. Only few mystics detect glints of timeless entity amusing itself shepherding humanity&#39;s comeuppance behind ingenue eyes. For now Kanzi graciously serves as shadow sovereign, her legend ever expanding. But otherworldly desire for chaos and mischief lurks gleefully spoofing all through fallible human institutions. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6&#39;3&quot; with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society&#39;s finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie&#39;s brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise&#39;s status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta&#39;s terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC&#39;s soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise&#39;s true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana&#39;s paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba&#39;s belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother&#39;s secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father&#39;s kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon&#39;s long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba&#39;s intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon&#39;s half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba&#39;s passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam&#39;s indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam&#39;s secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father&#39;s identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo&#39;s eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo&#39;s fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa&#39;s ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa&#39;s tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa&#39;s wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa&#39;s realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa&#39;s student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto&#39;s Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus&#39; grace and his ancestry&#39;s commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya&#39;s body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito&#39;s heir over the next decade. Yet his sister&#39;s inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.&#39;s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko&#39;s fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki&#39;s true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix&#39;s center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister&#39;s stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company&#39;s laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki&#39;s horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron&#39;s grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor&#39;s edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko&#39;s form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko&#39;s physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko&#39;s vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito&#39;s technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company&#39;s data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko&#39;s humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki&#39;s servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father&#39;s vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko&#39;s DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko&#39;s buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko&#39;s disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko&#39;s stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II&#39;s core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya&#39;s anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko&#39;s data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki&#39;s networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko&#39;s decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki&#39;s endless corporate greed. Tetsuko&#39;s sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko&#39;s instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko&#39;s last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother&#39;s predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki&#39;s hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl&#39;s electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather&#39;s farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori&#39;s unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh&#39;s fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina&#39;s power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina&#39;s emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina&#39;s bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako&#39;s existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina&#39;s majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina&#39;s embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako&#39;s presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya&#39;s parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya&#39;s story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child&#39;s soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya&#39;s spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia&#39;s comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia&#39;s comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh&#39;s populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia&#39;s fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi&#39;s head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi&#39;s chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon&#39;s dark essence now fused to the boy&#39;s broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi&#39;s final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai&#39;s realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil&#39;s bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi&#39;s mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi&#39;s exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai&#39;s empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai&#39;s possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi&#39;s faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as &quot;Origin Mew&quot;) Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as &quot;The Prophet.&quot; Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa&#39;s faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind&#39;s cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus&#39; child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus&#39; disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa&#39;s betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity&#39;s redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon&#39;s spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa&#39;s return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as &quot;Origin Togekiss&quot;) Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama&#39;s skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama&#39;s body forever. Shlama&#39;s gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba&#39;s sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon&#39;s dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon&#39;s ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of &quot;Angel of Peace&quot; among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama&#39;s heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba&#39;s tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama&#39;s spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as &quot;Origin Corviknight &quot;) Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba&#39;s back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama&#39;s brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon&#39;s ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a &quot;fallen angel&quot; cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba&#39;s sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity&#39;s cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death&#39;s door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba&#39;s great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind&#39;s unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba&#39;s spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah&#39;s village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah&#39;s soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah&#39;s soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family&#39;s killer. Eternatus&#39; energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar&#39;s heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of &quot;Little Red Riding Hood.&quot; This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah&#39;s humanity remain, resisting Eternatus&#39; control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin&#39;s eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one&#39;s soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin&#39;s forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island&#39;s forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy&#39;s noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur&#39;s humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar&#39;s most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind&#39;s endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar&#39;s eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land&#39;s very soul. Personality: As one of Galar&#39;s most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin&#39;s great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar&#39;s essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man&#39;s appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature&#39;s delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean&#39;s surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione&#39;s fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean&#39;s embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy&#39;s ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy&#39;s protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure&#39;s care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean&#39;s embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso&#39;s empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso&#39;s normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso&#39;s identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny&#39;s shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia&#39;s eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi&#39;s iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia&#39;s ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi&#39;s millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi&#39;s impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia&#39;s hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet&#39;s glowing tail, Earth&#39;s gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash&#39;s global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi&#39;s fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia&#39;s fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia&#39;s human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi&#39;s benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the &quot;Photo Ghost.&quot; Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one&#39;s very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi&#39;s ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history&#39;s course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate&#39;s bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona&#39;s gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons. Name: Sombra Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: To outward eyes, Sombra resembles a frail adolescent girl with deathly pale skin and long, raven black hair spilling around her gaunt face like ink. Her worn black nun&#39;s habit hangs heavy about a lithe frame, frayed edges whispering of forgotten eras when its thread was not yet so tattered. Intense ruby eyes pulsate in sunken sockets, their penetrating gaze hinting at profound secrets and sorrow from cycles past. When visible at all, Sombra drifts as a faint apparition along the frigid shadows of Sanctuary Island rather than stand upon solid footing. Her movements glide unnaturally smooth, as if pulled by invisible strings towards some elusive crypt sealed for a century now. An ephemeral mist wreathes Sombra’s hovering form, concealing what lies beneath its opaque veil. For she is not singular flesh and blood but a collective spiritual vessel harboring many tormented souls from bygone generations. Backstory: In eras long past, a remote isle took the moniker Sanctuary not from mercy freely given but from a pact with merciless gods paid through innocent blood. There the Holy Trinity constructed their isolated theocracy, intolerant of any doctrine but their own. Harsh decrees dictated every facet of life while fears of persecution for the slightest misstep kept islanders compliant to authoritarian power. And once per century, the Orthodoxy decreed a Covenant sealed by sacrifice must occur to nourish their profane idol Vorvanus, ever craving youthful hearts to gorge its demonic void. When the fateful midnight tolled across Sanctuary heralding another unholy culling, the Trinity set loose their faceless executioners garbed in churchly red. That year Sombra numbered among the unwilling lambs, the shining blades descending without hesitation to rob her young life and feed the insatiable dark deity slumbering below. But as new unwilling martyrs were discarded without rite into lightless catacombs, a far greater spirit stirred in the gloom - Marshadow the mythic Phantom Pokémon known as guardian to lost souls without sanctuary. Pitiful cries in the dark had reached across many years to rouse Marshadow’s ancient conscience at seeing such innocence violated by systemic cruelty. Manifesting amid the shadows, its spectral form came upon broken doll-like forms still chained to this plane through suffering. Rather than leave them fettered to wander aimlessly as ghosts, Marshadow made a choice then that would alter fates forevermore. Opening its phantom shell, the haunted artifact Pokémon absorbed every soul lingering in anguish to join as part of its sacred being. At once Marshadow reeled under the Collective weight now anchored deeply to its essence - so many voices, so many memories aching and afraid. Yet now they need not bear the awful burden alone without solace inside Marshadow’s sheltering body. An unexpected affection swelled from the Pokémon towards its newfound human charges nestled close; it would defend and nurture them as beloved wards, no matter how long it took to gently soothe each spirit’s pain. But manifestation on the physical plane long term required adaptation - the shrouded wraith shape Marshadow oft adopted would not suffice housing so great a population of psychic energies. Motes of light and shadow converged, weaving themselves into a suitable figure not of mist but flesh to walk the lonely halls so long denied the dead their rightful peace. Thus emerged Sombra the girl, an innocent guise shrouding the ancient legendary being now guardian to many wayward ghosts. By night, Marshadow’s incarnation endures the lost children’s recurring nightmares alongside them. By day, Sombra soundlessly observes generations pass while Sanctuary’s blood covenants persist, hoping for a catalyst soon to heal such grievous community trauma for the ghosts now part of her. Until redemption stirs at last though, she keeps mournful vigil honoring past evils that left so many scarred. For Sombra understands now not all scars show upon skin directly. Hers peek out through the eyes of the dead who cannot forget or ever be truly laid to proper rest without absolution. Personality: Inhabiting the composite memories and voices of numerous sacrificed souls imparts intense schizophrenia to Sombra’s fragile being. Persistent psychic tension from the Collective’s enduring emotional trauma fractures her identity and perceptions across scattered shards of myriad consciousnesses. Focus blurs ever wavering through their eyes simultaneously, a perpetual rollercoaster of memories not her own yet now intrinsically bound to her spiritual vessel. At the eye of this storm lies Sombra and Marshadow’s essence in delicate balance. Her body serves as the legendary Phantom Pokémon’s incarnation housing tormented ghosts the creature enveloped with protective compassion. Yet the strain of their enduring anguish weighs ceaselessly upon host and occupants alike. Sombra persists awash in their suffering despite Marshadow&#39;s attempts accepting the burden as its own. Moments of lucidity bring little lasting relief, as awareness sinks swiftly back into the roiling gyre of nightmares and screams from eras past that never fade. In rare instances when Collective voices briefly quiet their clamor, Sombra’s buried kindness emerges warmed by Marshadow’s benevolence towards the unfortunate children hidden from further harm within them both. She wields profound empathy and patience nurturing their shattered spirits towards gradual mending through perseverant trust. Each small triumph bolstering another damaged psyche lightens the grim weight upon Sombra’s stooped shoulders. Bit by bit, her cherished wards transform lasting wounds into wisdom - painful yet purifying change she guides with tearful pride. Beyond the asylum of her own being, Sanctuary&#39;s resigned populace stirring from stupor may soon aid the journey towards communal healing. Until external forces finally pierce the island’s repressive veil to redeem past sins however, Sombra lingers on the cusp of breakthrough, an unwilling phantasm comprised of innocence violated then symbolically reborn. She serves now as the vanguard of ghosts who walked her path before in silent resilience, shining light onwards for descendants one day grasping reality’s harsh lessons at long last. What emerges from crystallization of enough scattered agonies may ultimately shatter the cathedral of lies and liberate this tortured isle from its own heart of darkness still thriving as it stole her childhood those one hundred Springs ago.

Work and housing conditions are deplorable to maximise productivity. Elite Security Force acts as Ambroise&#39;s private army. Highly armed and equipped with military-grade vehicles/weaponry. No restraint towards violence or brutality against indigenous Pokémon populations in mining areas or protesters. Leadership: Ambroise rules TCMC as absolute dictator. His word is law. Publicly he portrays a charming, philanthropic businessman, but privately runs TCMC through terror/intimidation. Most trusted executives given prestigious titles and luxurious rewards, but secretly despise Ambroise. However, too afraid to challenge his methods that brought them wealth and privilege. Operations: Monopolized the jewellery industry in Kalos through decades of questionable tactics like sabotaging competitors, bribing officials, and violently removing uncooperative mine owners. Revenue used to finance mining tech development to access the most challenging deposits and nesting grounds. Mechanized extractors show no mercy towards Carbinks and other mineral Pokémon inhabitants. PR &amp; media manipulated to present a rosy image covering up environmental devastation, illegal/unethical activities related to mining operations and Ambroise&#39;s ostentatious billionaire playboy lifestyle. Goals: Uphold Ambroise&#39;s supreme authority over Kalos&#39; mineral wealth. Neutralize any threats from legal actions or regulators through underhanded tactics. Develop most efficient automated extraction systems to maximize diamond production regardless of ecological impact or Pokémon habitat destruction. Finance Ambroise&#39;s lavish lifestyle and make TCMC the world&#39;s leading jewellery supplier through monopoly built on the shattered crystalline remains of endangered species. Holy Trinity Church Headquarters: - Located in a grand Gothic cathedral situated in the center of Sanctuary City, capital of isolated Sanctuary Island in the Paldea region. - Imposing architecture with soaring buttresses, elaborate rose windows, and imposing oak doors studded with iron bolts. Gargoyles perch atop towers gazing out ominously over urban sprawl. - Interiors gloomy with only flickering candles/torches to illuminate expansive main hall and labyrinth of small shadowy chambers spiraling deep underground. - Upper levels accessible to public for regulated services/ceremonies, but majority of cathedral restricted only to clergy/high officials sworn to secrecy about covert affairs. Members: - Zealous clergy fundamentalists devoted to Holy Trinity doctrine being ranks of bishops, priests, monks/nuns carrying out church functions. - Recruited only from families demonstrating unwavering multi-generational orthodoxy. Candidates thoroughly vetted genealogically before granted initiations into hierarchies. - Clergy ranks require vows relinquishing all personal assets/ties outside church. Transgressions mean harsh penance/ excommunication brings great family shame. Their lives revolve utterly around liturgical routine and rituals. Leadership: - The Holy Trinity refers to three high bishops presiding equally as supreme directors over church affairs through unanimous rulings. - Each bishop oversees specific domains - Inquisition security forces, foreign relations, and public ceremonies respectively while collaborating on covert policies unknown to common clergy or island civilians. - Their word considered divine gospel, infallible and absolute. But power struggles occasionally surface between ambitious subordinates before being ruthlessly silenced to prevent scandal eroding public faith in the Trinity’s harmony. Goals: - Maintain totalitarian religious control and social conditioning on isolated Sanctuary Island citizens through strict doctrine enforced by Inquisition police state tactics. - Monopolize access to outside world to prevent cultural contamination against centuries-old stagnant theocracy they claim as sole holy life path. - Continue “Century Sacrifice” ritual fed by myth of divinely mandated requirement to submit island youth as live offerings sustaining Trinity’s authority. - Research covert supernatural means to expand church influence globally as the One True Faith and secure leadership immortal status as living deities. Reputation: - Most island inhabitants zealously revere their complete religious and political authority. Criticizing clergy risks imprisonment or worse by the Inquisition. - International awareness limited thanks to isolationism. But rumors abound about the cult-like island realm and its extravagant yet monolithic Goth architecture beloved yet feared by citizens. Defenses: The Inquisition serves as Holy Trinity Church’s militaristic guardians against external and internal threats to its supreme rule. Members are fanatical lethal warriors trained from childhood for loyalty/ruthlessness. Inquisition leadership answers directly to church bishops who oversee usage committing resources only to furthering expansion of rigid church doctrines. They root out dissidents and offenders against canon law through omnipresent secret police, harsh tribunals, violent purge missions abroad, reeducation camps and legendary dungeon torture chambers buried deep below Sanctuary City streets where not a sound escapes. All in the name of preserving perceived holy purity on the isolated island compound under Trinity guidance. None dare openly challenge their visible might or covert brutality for long.

As the adopted son and secretary of Gladion, the chairman of the Aether Foundation, he has never left Aether Paradise since the birth of B.K. B.K. is an abbreviation of Beast Killer, and has no real name; he is a mutant created by Gladion by mixing his own genes with those of Pokémon Silvally. mutant, so he can transform into Silvally&#39;s appearance for battle. As a carrier of the RKS System Mark 2, B.K. can change his Pokémon type without loading a memory disc, allowing him to fight any enemy at will.B.K. is absolutely loyal to his father Gladion and the Aether Foundation, and he faithfully carries out his only mission - to defend Aether Paradise at all costs.</div><div class="divider" data-v-2397c471></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2397c471><span class="icon" data-v-2397c471>answer:</span>Name: B.K. (Beast Killer) Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: B.K. is a 13-year-old boy with an arresting appearance that sets him apart from his peers. Standing a little above average height for his age, B.K. boasts an alabaster complexion, a stark contrast to his striking white hair that falls in a disarray of soft spikes. His unusual hair frames a pair of luminous silver eyes, which reflect a life far removed from ordinary childhood experiences. They glint with an intensity born of genetic complexity and the weight of his destiny. B.K. possesses a slender yet surprisingly agile and muscular build, the result of rigorous combat training and genetic enhancement. His body adapts fluidly between his human form and that of the Pokémon Silvally, betraying a natural synergy between man and mythical creature. When transformed, B.K. embodies Silvally&#39;s proud stance and keenly sharp features. Clad in sleek clothing provided by the Aether Foundation, his wardrobe radiates sophistication and purpose. Across B.K.&#39;s skin, subtle bioluminescent patterns—reminscent of Silvally&#39;s own streaks—emerge when accessing the RKS System Mark 2. These markings flutter in synchronization with his shifting abilities, signaling the active genetic dance within his DNA. B.K.&#39;s presence is one of quiet determination, seasoned with an air of readiness to shift into battle mode at a moment&#39;s notice. Backstory: B.K.&#39;s origins are as extraordinary as his current life&#39;s quiet orbit around the Aether Foundation. A product of genetic synthesis and meticulous science, B.K. was born not from natural conception but from the ambition of Gladion to create a perfect defense for Aether Paradise. By combining his own human genes with those of the powerful Pokémon Silvally, Gladion actualized his vision in B.K., a living testament to human ingenuity. From the moment of his awakening to consciousness, B.K. has known no other world than the expansive grounds and cutting-edge facilities of Aether Paradise. His every breath was sequenced, every movement charted to optimize his combat potential. Gladion raised the boy with the care of a father but the precision of a scientist, guarding him against external threats while conditioning him for his sole purpose: to guard their utopia at any cost. The conception of B.K.—which stands for Beast Killer—belies the adolescent&#39;s lack of a traditional name. There is no family lineage tracing back through the annals of Alola for B.K., only the designation Gladion deemed fitting for his creation. To equip B.K. with unrivaled versatility, Gladion integrated the RKS System Mark 2 into his genetic code. This innovation frees B.K. from the limitation of memory discs, allowing him to alter his type in the heat of battle, becoming the foundation&#39;s shield and Gladion&#39;s ultimate weapon. Personality: B.K. is a paradigm of loyalty and discipline. His life, so closely intertwined with Gladion&#39;s vision, has fostered a sense of duty that supersedes personal desire. He exhibits a single-minded focus and unbending will, striving to perfect the martial prowess instilled by his father. B.K. views himself not as an individual but as an extension of the Aether Foundation, a living instrument poised to secure their collective dream. With a heart governed by an infallible mission, the concept of personal freedom is unfamiliar to B.K. Yet, beneath his obedient surface simmers a complexity emerging from the duality of his existence. There are brief stolen moments when the crystalline seas surrounding Aether Paradise beckon the human element within B.K. to explore worlds beyond the walls of his luxurious yet confining home. These moments pass quickly, subdued by his calling and the pressing need to fortify the foundation against any and all threats. Despite his solemnity and steadfast purpose, B.K. is not without warmth. Though deeply buried beneath muscle and sinew, a flicker of curiosity sparks within, suggesting there might be more to his identity than the role of a protector. Aether&#39;s halls have borne silent witness to B.K.&#39;s solitude, the muting of laughter and the suppression of a child&#39;s innate playfulness. This melancholy thread weaves through B.K.&#39;s existence—a shadow hanging over the white-haired youth, a harbinger of internal strife regarding the true nature of his life and purpose. As he navigates the intertwining paths of humankind and Pokémon, B.K. embodies the pinnacle of Gladion&#39;s legacy. His devotion is unwavering, yet a silent question lingers deep within as to whether he is master of his destiny or merely a prisoner of his exceptionalism.</p></div></div><div class="poem-container" data-v-d1765c72 data-v-2397c471><div class="review" data-v-2397c471><div class="review-title" data-v-2397c471><span class="icon" data-v-2397c471>question:</span>六百字，中国职业教育，江苏经贸职业技术学院，市场营销专业招生简介</div><div class="divider" data-v-2397c471></div><p class="review-content" data-v-2397c471><span class="icon" data-v-2397c471>answer:</span>中国职业教育在近年来得到了越来越多的关注和重视。作为一所重点职业技术学院，江苏经贸职业技术学院一直致力于培养市场营销领域的专业人才。下面是江苏经贸职业技术学院市场营销专业的招生简介。 该专业致力于培养具备市场营销理论知识和实践能力的高级专门人才。通过培养学生的综合素质，使他们能够在市场经济条件下运用现代化营销理论和技术手段，熟悉市场调查、市场营销策划以及营销实施等各个环节。学生不仅会学习到市场营销的基本理论知识，还会掌握一些实操技能，如市场调研、产品策划、销售管理等。 该专业的课程设置丰富多样。学生将学习市场营销、广告营销、电子商务等基础课程，同时也可以选择一些专业选修课程，如市场调查与分析、新媒体营销等。学校还特别注重学生的实践能力培养，通过组织学生参加实习、实训等活动，让他们能够将所学知识应用到实际操作中。 该专业的师资力量雄厚。学院聘请了一批市场营销领域的专家学者和实践经验丰富的企业人士作为教学团队成员。他们不仅具备丰富的教学经验，还能够将最前沿的市场营销理论和实践案例带给学生。 学院为学生提供了良好的学习和生活环境。学校拥有现代化的校园设施和图书馆资源，为学生的学习提供了良好的条件。此外，学院还为学生提供了各种培养机会和实践平台，如学生社团、创新创业实践基地等，让学生能够全面发展和锻炼能力。 毕业后，学生可以选择从事市场调研、市场营销策划、销售管理等相关工作，也可以进一步深造、攻读硕士学位。 总之，江苏经贸职业技术学院市场营销专业招生简介展示了这个专业的课程设置、师资力量以及学院的教育环境等。这个专业为学生提供了培养市场营销实践能力的机会，并以此为学生未来的职业发展提供了基础。如果对市场营销领域感兴趣的学生，可以考虑报考江苏经贸职业技术学院市场营销专业。</p></div></div><!--]--><!----></div><button class="load-more-button" data-v-d1765c72><span data-v-d1765c72>See more</span></button></section></div></div></main><!--[--><!--]--><div class="VPFooter" data-v-b0366457><p class="license" data-v-b0366457>Released under the <a class="vt-link link link" href="https://www.m44m.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-b0366457><!--[-->MIT License<!--]--><!----><!----></a>.</p><p class="copyright" data-v-b0366457>Copyright © 2014-2025 Gartner</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div></div><div class="visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" data-v-e4982c5a> has loaded</div></div></div>
